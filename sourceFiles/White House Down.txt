1
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:03,706
<i>The vice president is scheduled
to preside over a Senate vote today...</i>

2
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,947
<i>...on President Sawyer's
controversial Middle East peace plan.</i>

3
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:09,265
<i>Then tomorrow,
the vote will go to Congress.</i>

4
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:11,233
<i>Republicans and Democrats...</i>

5
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:13,989
<i>...have indicated they will vote
along party lines...</i>

6
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:16,988
<i>...but some members have indicated
that they may cross over.</i>

7
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:45,349
Castle, this is Hummingbird.

8
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,029
We are inbound from Andy.
We're three minutes out.

9
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:52,669
Carol. He wants to do the thing.

10
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,593
- Really?
- Really.

11
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:58,504
Mr. President, it isn't a good idea
to deviate from the flight plan.

12
00:01:58,715 --> 00:01:59,785
Pretty please, Carol?

13
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,231
Leader of the free world
saying "pretty please"?

14
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:04,272
That ought to count for something.

15
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:09,948
Captain Johns, we are going to deviate
from Route Omaha.

16
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:13,187
The president would like
to do the thing.

17
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,705
<i>Copy that.
Let's give him the special tour.</i>

18
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,786
<i>Dropping to 30 feet.</i>

19
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:54,193
Do you know that Abraham Lincoln
was the first U.S. president...

20
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:57,069
...who was in favour of women
having the vote?

21
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:00,825
He wrote a paper on suffrage while
he was still in the Illinois legislature.

22
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:02,065
Yes, I did know that...

23
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,346
...because you tell me
every time we do this.

24
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:11,510
<i>Castle, this is Hummingbird.
We are short Foxtrot, one minute out.</i>

25
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:14,713
<i>- I need a go-no go.
- Sky Sector 1, Castle Ground...</i>

26
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:16,906
<i>...all clear, three inbound.</i>

27
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,109
<i>Castle Ground, Sky Sector 1, report.</i>

28
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,710
Hummingbird, this is Castle Ground.
You are clear.

29
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,866
Scanning sky south.

30
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,030
Clear.

31
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:29,949
Clear.

32
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,634
Hummingbird, this is Castle Sky.

33
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:35,194
You are clear.

34
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:38,786
Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep.
You are... Wait. Hold.

35
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:41,265
<i>- Castle Ground, we are holding.
- Air Command...</i>

36
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:43,028
- ...switch to thermal.
- Roger that.

37
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:44,270
Switching to thermal.

38
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,946
<i>Confirm Sector 5,
southeast quadrant clear.</i>

39
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,471
Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep.
You're clear.

40
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,148
<i>Copy that.</i>

41
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:00,553
<i>Breaking off for security sweep.
Stand by.</i>

42
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:11,948
Hummingbird approaching.

43
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,792
<i>Castle Ground, all clear.</i>

44
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:18,792
Be it ever so humble.

45
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:26,550
Atten-hut! Escort!

46
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,068
Not a bad way to travel, is it?

47
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:32,545
Beats Dupont Circle, sir.

48
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,433
What time does my wife get in?

49
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:41,031
- Eighteen forty-five.
- Wake me if civilisation ends.

50
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,386
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,705
Hummingbird, you are released.

52
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:53,344
Tell me we don't have the best job
in the world.

53
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:59,793
<i>I believe the number-one source
of violence in our world is poverty.</i>

54
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:04,468
<i>Now, we were poor in my neighbourhood.
Sometimes we couldn't even eat.</i>

55
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:07,070
<i>And my best friend Ricky,
he had it worse than us.</i>

56
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,312
<i>One day things got
so desperate for Ricky...</i>

57
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,386
<i>...he made a plan
to rob the corner store.</i>

58
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:14,229
<i>And I told my mother about it.
You know what she did?</i>

59
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:17,467
<i>She had him over,
cooked him a full meal...</i>

60
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:20,548
<i>...and told him that he could stay with us
as long as he wanted.</i>

61
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:23,389
<i>And it was then that I realised
that if you feed a man...</i>

62
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,592
<i>you take away his propensity
for violence.</i>

63
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:27,388
Come on, we're gonna be late.

64
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,749
Hey, hey, hey-

65
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:32,714
No, no, no. That's... No, that's not...
That's not...

66
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,673
This is not happening right now.

67
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,553
Clyde, we've had this conversation.

68
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:39,070
My boss does not like squirrels.
It's a bird feeder.

69
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,589
Will you at least look at me
when I'm talking to you?

70
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:47,669
Look, man, I like squirrels personally,
but you're getting me in trouble.

71
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,553
Do you see this?

72
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:51,394
You know what this is?

73
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:54,105
Hey. We gonna need backup?

74
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:58,434
We're working. Come on.

75
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:01,030
- We have any more Robitussin?
- Yes, sir. In the car.

76
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,266
No, I'll get it, it's all right.
Quiet night?

77
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:05,153
We're under attack by squirrels.

78
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:07,352
They're organised
and they have the numbers.

79
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:09,631
Little stinkers trying to get
into the feeder?

80
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:10,830
- Morning.
- Hey, Roy.

81
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,111
This isn't the most glamorous job
in the world.

82
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:14,908
Look, I appreciate it very much.

83
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:19,228
- Yeah, we'll be there in 10 minutes.
- As leaders, we have a choice.

84
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:22,348
<i>We can sit back
and let the same cycle of war...</i>

85
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,587
<i>...continue in the Middle East
or we can do something about it.</i>

86
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,634
<i>You know how much money
we've spent on the war since 2001?</i>

87
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:32,311
<i>Over a trillion dollars.
Could you imagine if you had...</i>

88
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,705
It's gonna be a busy morning, boys.

89
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:39,153
<i>- -Education, food, health care
and infrastructure in the Middle East.</i>

90
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,307
<i>Now, we've begun historic talks
with the republic of Iran's...</i>

91
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:44,625
<i>...newly elected president, Al-Sharif...</i>

92
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:48,305
<i>...to build peace throughout his region.
America can't do this alone.</i>

93
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,308
<i>We need the full financial support
of all of our allies.</i>

94
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,591
<i>But what we can do
is take the first step.</i>

95
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:55,314
<i>Therefore, I'm announcing today...</i>

96
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:58,513
<i>...that all U. S. troops will be removed
from the Middle East.</i>

97
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:01,633
<i>Let's not repeat the same mistakes
that we made in the past.</i>

98
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,594
<i>And Lord knows,
I've made some mistakes myself.</i>

99
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,793
<i>Instead, I ask you
to stand with me today.</i>

100
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:11,630
<i>Sign this treaty. Let's end
this debilitating pattern of violence...</i>

101
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:15,390
<i>...and let's show the world that the pen
is truly mightier than the sword.</i>

102
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,590
<i>Thank you.</i>

103
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:20,385
<i>President Sawyer delivered what can
only be described as a historic speech...</i>

104
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,592
<i>- ...earlier today in Geneva.
- Here.</i>

105
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:25,349
<i>- Let's go live...
- You changed your hair.</i>

106
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,344
Last week.

107
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:29,270
I'm gonna be late tonight.

108
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,512
I love you very much.

109
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,193
Good morning, sir.

110
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,110
John, what do you think
of the president's proposal?

111
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:52,989
I don't know. It's good
to have less enemies, I guess.

112
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:56,074
You're a military man.
You don't think he's putting us at risk?

113
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:59,068
That's a little above my pay grade.
If you feel that way...

114
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:01,590
- ...why didn't you run against him?
- No, no, no.

115
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:04,110
That's one job I never wanted.
I like my office.

116
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,674
I like my constituents.

117
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,389
I like being a thorn in the side
of the administration.

118
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,865
But I think voters today
want somebody cool.

119
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:14,067
Oh, come on, Mr. Speaker,
I think you're pretty cool.

120
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,306
He went to bed at 8 and watched...

121
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:23,507
The president has a call scheduled
with the speaker at 9:30.

122
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,825
- I should be there for that, shouldn't I?
- No.

123
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:28,509
You have to be here
in case of a deadlock...

124
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,074
Hey, I'm gonna see you later.

125
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:31,913
- -With the red tie for that.

126
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,907
- Jenna?
- Absolutely, Mr. Vice President.

127
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:36,351
Red tie's the way to go.

128
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:39,826
Jenna. Jenna. Did you get me in?

129
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:42,390
- What do I get if I did?
- What do you want?

130
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,625
Dinner. Candlelight.

131
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:47,265
And a promise that you will try
to get to second base.

132
00:08:47,915 --> 00:08:49,064
Done.

133
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,954
You're meeting with Carol Finnerty,
deputy special agent...

134
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,504
...in charge of the president's
Secret Service.

135
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:56,752
- I need a favour.
- This is a favour.

136
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:59,350
I need another favour.
I need a pass for my daughter.

137
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,114
- John...
- You don't understand.

138
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:04,984
She's a freak for this kind of stuff,
so if I get her in, I'm Dad of the Year.

139
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,908
I will owe you so much more
than just candlelight dinner.

140
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:12,113
<i>- I'll make a call.
- Perfect. Thank you. You're the best.</i>

141
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:44,826
<i>...A truly historic handshake.</i>

142
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:48,625
<i>What President Sawyer is proposing
to Iranian president Al-Sharif...</i>

143
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:52,550
<i>...is withdrawing all American troops
across the entire Middle East...</i>

144
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:55,070
<i>...and for that he'll ask
his G8 partners for help.</i>

145
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:57,790
<i>It's all about money,
and who won't like this deal...</i>

146
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:01,186
<i>...are American companies who do
business with the American military.</i>

147
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,348
Wanna grab the door? Em.

148
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:06,028
I'll get it.

149
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:09,709
- Hey.
- You're late.

150
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:13,545
- She thought you weren't coming.
- Why wouldn't I be coming?

151
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:17,506
Hey, you, little face.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go, baby.

152
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:23,555
- Bye, Mommy. I love you.
- I love you too, sweetie.

153
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:25,430
What's up...?

154
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:30,750
I literally just walked in the door.
What did I do?

155
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:32,633
You missed her talent show.

156
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,708
No, I didn't miss it.
That's, like, next Thursday.

157
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,469
No, it was last Thursday.

158
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:40,831
It was on the school calendar.

159
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:43,709
What did she do?

160
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,388
She was a flag twirler.

161
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:48,869
That's a talent?

162
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:53,308
She practised for like six weeks, John.
She thought you were gonna be there.

163
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:56,228
It would've been really nice
to have a bit of a reminder.

164
00:10:56,395 --> 00:11:00,309
- Come on, I'm not your secretary, John.
- I'm not asking you to be my secretary.

165
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:02,432
Look, I'm just... I'm trying.

166
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:04,592
I'm trying really hard to be in her life.

167
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:06,905
It's a little late for that,
wouldn't you say?

168
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:12,230
Have a good day.

169
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,991
Are you mad at me?

170
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,350
Just tell me.

171
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:21,233
Will you be on that all day long?

172
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:32,585
"Yes." Well, that sucks, because,
you know, I thought you would...

173
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:34,951
- ...want this, but...
- Lame.

174
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,186
You don't even know what it is.

175
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:41,395
Do you really think a bribe's
gonna work?

176
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:43,273
Yeah. I'm hoping so.

177
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:46,826
- We're both adults here, John.
- Speak for yourself, okay?

178
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,952
Can you please just open it?

179
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:51,675
- For me?
- What is it?

180
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:55,351
It's a pony, baby. I don't...
Come on, for me, please just...

181
00:12:01,715 --> 00:12:03,274
These are White House passes.

182
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:07,192
Yeah. That might mean
we're going to the White House.

183
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,471
And that your dad here
has a job interview...

184
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,228
...with the Secret Service.

185
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,148
This is really cool, John.

186
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:19,068
- You're just gonna stick with "John"?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:24,274
<i>Now The Roger Skinner Show,
today live from the White House.</i>

188
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:27,075
<i>Hi, folks. President Sawyer
is one of those academics...</i>

189
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:29,112
<i>...who never served a day in his life...</i>

190
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:32,347
<i>...and now he wants to tell the military
how to run things?</i>

191
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:35,911
<i>He's going to make peace with Iran
because he has friends there now?</i>

192
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:37,745
Come on.

193
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:39,588
Sir, I have the first lady for you.

194
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:42,634
Remind me again why we let these guys
broadcast from our lawn.

195
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,513
- Freedom of the press.
- You know what?

196
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,348
I knew it was something.

197
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:49,385
Hey, babe.
How are the French taking it?

198
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:52,354
The treaty's gonna be
a tough sell here.

199
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:54,665
<i>- How's it going there?
- Raphelson is the key.</i>

200
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:58,032
We lose him, then we lose
that Southern voting bloc.

201
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,948
If this goes down, you're looking
at a one-term president.

202
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,868
I know two people who wouldn't
have a problem with that.

203
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,867
<i>Do you still have that watch
I gave you?</i>

204
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,868
Yes, Miss First Lady.
It's in my pocket next to my heart.

205
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:11,026
You know, Mary Todd
gave it to Lincoln...

206
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:14,028
...to remind him he only had
so much time to do good things...

207
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:16,550
- ...while he was in that chair.
- I hear you.

208
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:19,184
Well, kiss Amber for me, okay?

209
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:20,874
<i>I love you ladies. Miss you.</i>

210
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:24,824
- I gotta go back to being president.
- I love you too.

211
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:31,233
Did you know that 1.5 million people
visit the White House every year?

212
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,989
No, I did not know that.

213
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:35,384
Look, I'm sorry.

214
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:38,593
I'm sorry that I didn't make it
to your talent show.

215
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:40,510
I'm not.

216
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,390
Seriously.

217
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:47,310
Did you know the White House used
to be called the Presidential Palace?

218
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:50,911
Look, I need you to hear me right now.
Look at me.

219
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,193
I really wished I was there.

220
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:56,747
No, you don't.

221
00:13:56,915 --> 00:14:01,193
All I... All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.

222
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:03,909
You know that you don't
have to do that with me, right?

223
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:07,113
- What?
- Have thick skin. You're 11.

224
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,588
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

225
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,752
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. Yourself?

226
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:18,946
- Good.
- Photo IDs, please.

227
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:21,748
Thank you.

228
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:26,184
- What are you guys looking for?
- Explosives.

229
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:30,393
This is awesome.

230
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:32,751
Park up on the left,
go into the East Lobby.

231
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,633
Have a good one.

232
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:41,945
Did you know that the president
travels in an 18-ton military-armoured...

233
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,789
...modified Cadillac CTS
built to withstand gas...

234
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:47,947
...chemical and missile attacks?

235
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:49,788
- That's on the Internet?
- Wikipedia.

236
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,869
- Capitol Police, off-duty.
- Have to check your weapon.

237
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:55,304
All right.

238
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:08,229
Check her good.

239
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,386
- Hey, Torn.
- Hey, buddy.

240
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:22,314
So how is your blog coming along?

241
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:24,745
Nobody says "blog" anymore, John.

242
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:26,827
What do you mean,
they don't say "blog"?

243
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:28,633
- I just learned "blog."
- Hi. Hi.

244
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,071
Just for 20 seconds,
act like you don't hate me.

245
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:32,754
- I'm Carol Finnerty.
- Hi. John.

246
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:35,993
- Carol?
- Cale.

247
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:38,154
Oh, my God. Carol Wilkes.

248
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:40,113
Actually, I'm Carol Finnerty now.

249
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,344
You're Deputy Special Agent Finnerty?

250
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:44,835
Oh, you're Jenna's favour.

251
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:50,992
This is Emily.
This is Em, my daughter.

252
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:54,274
My father is a very special man.

253
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:57,666
It's nice to meet you.

254
00:15:57,835 --> 00:15:59,667
I paid her to say that.

255
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:03,069
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

256
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,231
I don't know. Just...

257
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,155
Sorry, I gotta ask.

258
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:13,869
You didn't marry Jim Finnerty
from Sigma Chi, did you?

259
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:16,345
- That guy was...
- An asshole. Yes, he was.

260
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:18,666
This is my colleague,
Special Agent Todd.

261
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:20,826
Standard Secret Service
protocol requires...

262
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:25,108
...a two-agent review for every interview.
You're not to look at Agent Todd.

263
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,987
- I'm sorry, I just looked at him.
- You're only to look at me.

264
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,387
So we just... Okay.

265
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:35,551
The subject is John Cale.

266
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:39,151
Born 1980,
grew up in the District of Columbia...

267
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:41,192
...graduated Hill High in 1999.

268
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:44,552
Looks like you've bounced
from job to job.

269
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:46,945
Mechanic, limo driver, construction.

270
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,628
Is my credit score in there?

271
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:51,913
Yes, and you should be ashamed
of yourself.

272
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:53,270
It's a recession, okay?

273
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:56,746
Married Melanie Schopp in 2002...

274
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,145
...and had a child six months later.

275
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,704
Filed for divorce in 2005.

276
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,108
So you did three tours
in Afghanistan...

277
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,346
...and you were wounded
in the Kunar province.

278
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:10,665
- Yes, ma'am.
- You received a Silver Star...

279
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,788
...for pulling a Corporal Dawson
from a burning Humvee?

280
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:16,834
There was an IED attack.

281
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,748
Humvee flipped, we were taking fire,
so I grabbed him.

282
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,747
- Why?
- I was a little concerned...

283
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,350
...that he was getting
a little too warm in there.

284
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:27,788
It's funny to me, you still think glib
is the way to go here.

285
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:31,034
Corporal Dawson is the nephew
of the speaker of the house...

286
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:33,311
...and when you were discharged
a year ago...

287
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,625
...he got you a job
with the Capitol Police.

288
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,469
Actually, on his protection detail.

289
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,545
If Special Agent Todd
keeps making those sounds...

290
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:46,629
- ...I'm gonna start looking at him.
- Will you give us a second, please, Ryan?

291
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:54,147
John, why do you want to be
in the Secret Service?

292
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:59,191
I can't think of a more important job
than protecting the president.

293
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,790
Okay, this job requires
a university degree.

294
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,344
You dropped out of GW
after our first semester there.

295
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:08,230
- You don't finish things.
- Check the file, Carol.

296
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:11,553
Two years in college night school.

297
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,104
A certificate of graduation
should be in there.

298
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:15,874
Great.

299
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,354
Yeah, John, you barely maintained
a C average.

300
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:23,075
I'm sorry, I didn't have
our little study sessions...

301
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,226
...like we used to back in the day,
did I?

302
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,193
Evaluations from your senior officers:

303
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:30,473
"Cale frequently does not complete
his field reports on time."

304
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,387
Nothing to do
with protecting someone.

305
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:35,593
"Sergeant Cale demonstrates
a lack of respect for authority.

306
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:39,425
Sergeant Cale has raw potential
but seems determined not to realise it."

307
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,030
You can keep reading that.
That is not me anymore.

308
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:44,471
I'm not the kid
you used to know in college.

309
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:48,350
I've buttoned up every single thing
that I have to to qualify for this job.

310
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:51,195
I have 10 times more experience
than any Ivy League kid.

311
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:55,673
It's not just about experience. I would
need to depend on you every day.

312
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,712
What do you want me to do?

313
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,674
I'll start at the... I'll
start at the bottom.

314
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:04,195
Just give me a chance.

315
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:09,714
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:18,747
Did you get the job?

317
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,751
- Yeah, I think I got a shot.
- Really?

318
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,394
You know how it is.

319
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,155
They gotta go talk
amongst themselves and...

320
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:34,354
These... Look, these things,
they can be really political.

321
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:12,469
Good morning.
Light day at the White House today.

322
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:15,229
Eagle will remain on the 18 acres.

323
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,790
He has phone calls
to the congressional leadership.

324
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,275
First lady is back tonight?

325
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,585
Empress is wheels down at 1845.

326
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:25,714
They're supposed to have dinner at the
residence, but you know how they are.

327
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,072
So we should have an advance
on Obelisk, Marcel's, the usual.

328
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:32,273
- What if she wants sushi?
- No, no, she's off sushi.

329
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:34,631
Remember she had that thing
on the Japan trip?

330
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:38,311
- Carol, how are you still awake?
- Caffeine and patriotism, sir.

331
00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:39,988
- Threat matrix?
- Well...

332
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,147
...threats against POTUS
have quadrupled since the G8 speech.

333
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:46,387
PID is keeping an eye on a guy
in Buffalo they're worried about.

334
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:48,826
- Visitors today?
- Just the AV guys again.

335
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:52,113
DC Sonic, they're replacing
the surround system in the theatre.

336
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:55,666
- First lady must be thrilled.
- And she's...

337
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,508
She's coming back tonight?

338
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:03,953
Carol, is she coming back tonight?

339
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:07,471
Yes, sir. Wheels down at 1845.

340
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:10,191
Yes, of course.

341
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:14,426
As many of you are well-aware,
this is my last week here...

342
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:16,632
...so I wanna make this clear
to everybody:

343
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:19,867
If there are any congratulatory cakes
or any of that nonsense...

344
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:23,505
...I will be compelled
to use deadly force.

345
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:29,711
I hate you. I hate you all.

346
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:37,709
Thank you. No incendiaries
in the White House.

347
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:40,709
All right, baby,
I just gotta get my weapon real quick.

348
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,389
You're gonna have to sign out, sir.
Hello.

349
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:45,432
You guys here for the tour?

350
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,825
Do you think we can see
where you'll be working?

351
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,074
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

352
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:54,874
Gather around, everyone,
gather around. My name is Donnie...

353
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:58,591
...and I'll be your guide today as we take
a walk through American history.

354
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:02,714
I wanna give you all a warm Washington,
D.C. welcome to the White House...

355
00:22:02,915 --> 00:22:06,545
...where each year we get millions
of guests from every corner of the globe.

356
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:08,075
Where are you folks from?

357
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:10,070
Washington, D.C.

358
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:13,944
- Bad choice. What about you, ma'am?
- Nebraska.

359
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:15,753
What brings you to the White House?

360
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:19,033
I wanna see the tunnels where JFK
snuck Marilyn Monroe in.

361
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:22,631
Unfortunately, no such tunnels exist,
but don't worry, we have plenty...

362
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:24,911
...of other exciting sights
to show you guys.

363
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:27,112
Follow me this way.

364
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:30,273
Now, does anyone wanna guess
how old the White House is?

365
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,426
- Yes.
- Two hundred and twenty-two years old.

366
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:34,791
That's very accurate.

367
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:36,628
Construction began in 1792...

368
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:39,105
...on what was then called
the President's House.

369
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,154
Now, Article 1, Section 8
of the U.S. Constitution set forth...

370
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:44,784
...that a district of no more than
10 miles square...

371
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:47,947
...should house the new seat
of government. Does anyone know why?

372
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:50,948
So no one state could claim
the President's House.

373
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:53,629
Right again.
You're a real keener, aren't you?

374
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:55,388
Now, the founders were crafty...

375
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:57,472
Hey, so you can tell me the truth.

376
00:22:57,635 --> 00:23:00,104
Do you get picked on a lot in school?

377
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:02,027
No, I don't.

378
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:10,744
- It's a gift certificate for a massage.
- I could use one.

379
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:13,304
Martin, it's... It's been...

380
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,911
I know, for me too, Ted.

381
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:24,429
You know you're gonna miss this.

382
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:27,872
- When's the last time you took a day off?
- Oh, I'm fine.

383
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:29,390
I'm fine.

384
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:33,230
Piece of advice:
You gotta get back on the horse.

385
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:37,506
- Get back on the horse?
- First rule of divorce: Get right out there.

386
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:41,305
Sow some oats, break some hearts,
have actual human interaction...

387
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:44,155
...with a member of the opposite sex.

388
00:23:46,155 --> 00:23:50,991
Carol, you keep this up, 20 years
from now you're gonna look like me.

389
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,154
Well, there are worse things.

390
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:54,749
Don't make this your whole life.

391
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:57,588
Trust me.

392
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:00,748
It's not worth it.

393
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,674
Go home.

394
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,874
Get some rest.

395
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,389
Now.

396
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:13,635
And that is an order.

397
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:16,114
Yes, sir.

398
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:22,826
<i>Now, not too many people
realise this...</i>

399
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,350
...but the White House
is actually three buildings:

400
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:27,313
The East Wing
where you guys came in...

401
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:30,627
...the West Wing, which houses
the Oval and Executive Offices...

402
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:34,231
...and we're about to enter the residence,
which is the famous building that...

403
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:37,592
<i>- ...got blown up in Independence Day.
- What's in there?</i>

404
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:41,225
That's the president's home theatre.
Membership has its privileges.

405
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:43,909
Right this way
through the double doors, please.

406
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:46,225
There's still lots more to see.

407
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:48,308
You got a visitor.

408
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:54,990
Hey.

409
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,032
- Could you stay with the tour?
- Yeah.

410
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,754
Thank you.

411
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:07,669
The White House is big.

412
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:10,395
Including below-ground levels,
it's six storeys tall...

413
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:16,585
...with 132 rooms, 412 doors,
147 windows, 28 fireplaces...

414
00:25:16,755 --> 00:25:18,473
...and 35 bathrooms.

415
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:21,354
The grounds contain a tennis court,
a basketball court...

416
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:24,268
...a putting green, a jogging track
and a swimming pool.

417
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,949
- And where's the PEOC?
- The what?

418
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:30,187
She's referring to the Presidential
Emergency Operations Centre...

419
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:33,825
...which is this really cool bunker
behind 10 feet of concrete and steel...

420
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:36,908
...that's capable of surviving
a nuclear blast, plus...

421
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,988
...for your information, miss,
it's the one room in the house...

422
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:41,907
...that no one knows the location of.

423
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:44,715
WikiLeaks says
it's under the East Wing.

424
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,264
Who wants to see
the bowling alley, huh?

425
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:50,068
- Oh, my God.
- How we doing, folks?

426
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:51,794
- Mr. President.
- How's the tour?

427
00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:53,434
You see the basketball court?

428
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:56,474
Mr. President, can I ask you a question
for my YouTube channel?

429
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:59,024
- That'd be all right. What's your name?
- Emily Cale.

430
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:00,305
Emily Cale, go ahead.

431
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,307
- Okay.
- How I look on that thing?

432
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:04,227
I wasn't ready for a press conference.

433
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:07,672
How do you expect 22 Arab nations
with different regional...

434
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:10,475
...and religious interests
to agree on a single treaty...

435
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,990
...especially given the newly
erupting conflicts...

436
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,908
...between the Shiites and the Sunnis
in southern Pakistan?

437
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,304
Tough question.

438
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:21,273
To be honest with you, I don't know.
Whether they'll agree or not...

439
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:23,585
...I'm not sure, but I gotta try.

440
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:26,668
The day we stop believing
different people can come together...

441
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,793
...is the day we've given up on the world.
I'm not ready to.

442
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,026
What I am ready to do
is give a little girl...

443
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:34,152
...a shout-out on her YouTube blog.

444
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:37,675
Hi, folks,
my name is James W. Sawyer...

445
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:40,714
...and I'm here with Emily Cale
and her video blog.

446
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,229
Check it out.

447
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:43,829
- You have a good one.
- Wait.

448
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,185
Mr. President, this is my dad John.

449
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,665
He's gonna be
on your Secret Service detail.

450
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:50,633
Secret Service detail. Is that right?

451
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:53,355
You know, I take my protection detail
very seriously.

452
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:57,474
- Yes, sir.
- Stop lying to children.

453
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:00,793
- Nice to meet you, Emily.
- Nice to meet you too, Mr. President.

454
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:03,026
You guys have a good one.
Need your vote now.

455
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:05,106
Oh, my God, that was so fun.

456
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,710
Thought you said no one
says "blog" anymore, huh?

457
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,189
Bye, Fred.

458
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:12,954
Goodbye, Mrs. Finnerty.

459
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:17,715
Oil painting by Tom Freeman
to commemorate the burning...

460
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,230
...of the White House
by the British in 1814.

461
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:23,513
- Wait, the White House burned down?
- Yeah, yeah, in the War of 1812.

462
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,905
Practically had to be rebuilt
from the ground up.

463
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:29,233
When I look at this painting,
I get very emotional.

464
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,589
John.

465
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:35,225
I think I need to avail myself
of one of the 35 bathrooms in here.

466
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:37,588
There's a ladies' room downstairs.

467
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:40,355
- Where? I'll take her.
- I can go by myself, John.

468
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:41,744
I'm not a child.

469
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:44,270
Hey, just don't touch anything
or wander off...

470
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:46,995
...or talk to anybody
that you shouldn't be talking to.

471
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:48,793
I make no promises.

472
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:50,624
He's seven minutes behind.

473
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,832
Sorry, he got hung up
on the State Floor.

474
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:55,271
- Good morning, Margaret.
- Morning, Mr. President.

475
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:57,705
Could you get the speaker
on the phone?

476
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:58,910
Right away, sir.

477
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:01,874
Have you and the missus zeroed in
on a dining establishment?

478
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:04,549
When have you known the missus
to zero in on anything?

479
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:06,274
Fair point, sir.

480
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,711
Martin, I wanna shake your hand.

481
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:12,269
- We're all sorry to see you go.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

482
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:15,348
And I know that you and Muriel
have had a tough go of it...

483
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:18,189
- ...since Kevin passed, and...
- We all make sacrifices...

484
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:20,710
- ...for our country, sir.
- Yeah, but it's more...

485
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,786
I have the speaker of the house
for you.

486
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,434
I'm sorry.

487
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:27,194
Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,229
Right.

489
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:34,515
- Thank you, Margaret.
- You're welcome, sir.

490
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:39,715
- Eli.
- That was quite a speech, Mr. President.

491
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,310
If you were on board,
we'd have a real shot at peace.

492
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:45,786
You do know that your plan has upset
the entire defence industry.

493
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:48,595
These are powerful people
who give money to both parties.

494
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:52,066
I talked to President Al-Sharif again
about the discussion we had...

495
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:54,749
...and he's assuring me
that he has proof.

496
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:56,275
- And you believe him?
- I do.

497
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,904
Guys that run those corporations
have been in bed...

498
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:02,989
...with radical regimes for years. All they
wanna do is keep the cycle of war going.

499
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:05,066
Al-Sharif will expose them.

500
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:07,306
<i>All of that wrongdoing
is gonna come out...</i>

501
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:10,831
- ...as soon as our plan is signed.
- Sir, if your plan is signed.

502
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,190
Jesus.

503
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:29,186
Since when do you guys
come through here?

504
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:31,746
My supervisor told me
to come this way.

505
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:33,428
Stop.

506
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,786
Be careful next time.

507
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:49,186
<i>I know we've had our differences,
but I've never known you to be a man...</i>

508
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:52,188
<i>...to let politics stand in the way
of doing the right thing.</i>

509
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:56,110
If you stand with me on this, you can be
the man that could take these guys down.

510
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:59,188
I'd like to drag every one of these
CEOs in front of Congress...

511
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:02,865
...but there's more at stake here.
I can't support this, not at the risk...

512
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,787
...of leaving us militarily exposed.

513
00:30:04,955 --> 00:30:07,185
Come on, you know
those bases are for show now.

514
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,949
<i>We could launch a drone
off of any carrier in the gulf...</i>

515
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:11,554
<i>...and hit any target we want.</i>

516
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:25,030
Excuse me, miss.

517
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:27,550
Sir, you can't leave that there.

518
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,473
Hey, buddy!

519
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:35,749
Twenty-four, I'm in the rotunda.
I got a maintenance...

520
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,424
Eli, you all right?

521
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:57,313
Keep moving, let's go, push.

522
00:30:57,475 --> 00:30:58,749
Get your security teams up.

523
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:03,269
Mr. Speaker? Mr. Speaker?

524
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:04,789
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

525
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:06,866
We have to get out of here.
You follow me.

526
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,106
- Where's the vice president?
- In the chamber.

527
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:11,835
Tell him we need to institute
Continuity of Government.

528
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,794
- I tried. He's been cut by some glass.
- Now stay close.

529
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,275
Don't panic, take your time.

530
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:20,108
There's been an explosion
at the Capitol building.

531
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:22,186
- And?
- I'm crashing the White House.

532
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:24,625
We're crashing the White House.
Get the CAT Team.

533
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:26,308
I want all nonessentials
evac'd.

534
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:30,105
Get that hallway clear if we have to move.
Sergeant, bolt these doors.

535
00:31:30,315 --> 00:31:32,909
I need Marine 1 here
as fast as possible.

536
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:35,504
Sir, I need you to move away
from the window, sir.

537
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:36,824
Yeah.

538
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:39,464
Lock down all these doors.

539
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:42,188
- Do it quickly.
- Go, go, go!

540
00:31:42,355 --> 00:31:43,709
- Sir.
- The residence.

541
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:46,830
Bear with us.

542
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:49,032
Sir, we have a tour group
on the State Floor.

543
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:51,311
Hold them in the Blue Room.
Maintain positions.

544
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:52,909
Keep the hallways clear.

545
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:55,749
- Everybody stay where you are.
- My daughter's downstairs.

546
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,986
No one goes anywhere
till we lift the crash.

547
00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:01,466
- She's just a little girl. I gotta get her.
- Step away from the door.

548
00:32:05,435 --> 00:32:08,348
Keep moving, please. Everybody.

549
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:16,228
Gentlemen, we're on lockdown.
You can't be in here.

550
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:17,749
- Let's go.
- Sorry?

551
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,633
- We're on lockdown!
- Can't hear you!

552
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:23,834
You gotta be kidding me. Movie time
is over. Shut this down! Let's go.

553
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:29,269
Bobby, sync watches, 60 seconds.
Silencer.

554
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:32,309
Let's go.

555
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:35,186
<i>Yes, sir, that is correct, sir.</i>

556
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:37,153
<i>- We are on full lockdown.
- Hey!</i>

557
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:49,829
We need help up here now!

558
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:01,547
Security sweep! Open up!

559
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:09,312
Thirty seconds. Secure Air Comm.
Meet at the rally.

560
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:17,464
Armoury secure.

561
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:24,985
All right, let's go. Let's move, move!

562
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:28,034
- Hold up. We're on full lockdown here.
- Hey!

563
00:33:40,475 --> 00:33:43,274
East Hall secure.
Heading for Castle Sky.

564
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:52,510
<i>You've reached the voice mail of
Emily Cale. Why aren't you texting me?</i>

565
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:55,030
Em, as soon as you get this,
call me back.

566
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,112
- Keep moving, keep moving!
- Martin, I'm right outside the Capitol.

567
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:02,744
What the hell is happening?
Do you have the president?

568
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:06,431
I have Eagle. Call WFO, get as
many men as you can to the Capitol.

569
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:10,509
I'll dispatch everyone I can spare.
I want a hard perimeter around Castle.

570
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,473
A hard perimeter around Castle.

571
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,024
Eastside Gate.
Come on, let's go, people.

572
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:16,748
Fred, open the gate.

573
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:21,065
We're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be okay.

574
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,272
- They're exiting the building.
- Keep moving!

575
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:24,630
Castle South clear.

576
00:34:31,715 --> 00:34:33,035
Clear!

577
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:36,954
We have Castle Sky.

578
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:47,830
<i>Five agents in the East Gate,
four in the garden.</i>

579
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:51,431
<i>The rest should be on the South Lawn.
And two policemen on the South Gate.</i>

580
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,745
- Let's go.
- Let's go! Keep moving!

581
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:59,948
Shots fired. Code Black! Code Black!

582
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:02,669
- Say again. Say again.
- He said "shots fired."

583
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:05,349
Look, it's gotta be an AOP.
You gotta get out there.

584
00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:07,188
- Stand back.
- I'm not doing anything.

585
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,584
You serious? Look around.

586
00:35:08,755 --> 00:35:10,507
- Stand back!
- The threat is out there!

587
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,710
Go out and do your job!

588
00:35:11,915 --> 00:35:13,986
Donnie, where'd
you send my daughter?

589
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:17,193
I'm sure she's fine.
We're in the safest house in the world.

590
00:35:17,355 --> 00:35:19,665
Well, not today, it's not.

591
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:22,827
<i>- You've reached the voice mail...
- Em, pick up the phone.</i>

592
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,548
Can't tell where it's coming from.

593
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:31,433
I have no visual on him.

594
00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:34,990
Ten-four. Still have them on...?

595
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:36,304
No.

596
00:35:44,555 --> 00:35:46,671
- Clear!
- Clear!

597
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:59,146
<i>Negative, negative.
Snipers on the roof.</i>

598
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:02,910
<i>Do not approach Castle.
Repeat, do not approach Castle.</i>

599
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:04,668
<i>Do not advance. Do not advance.</i>

600
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:26,271
Say what?

601
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,426
Welcome to the White House,
Mr. Tyler.

602
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:31,747
I love what you've done with the place.
Bullet holes add to the decor.

603
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:35,913
Did you see that shit Conrad pulled off
at the Capitol? Goddamn!

604
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:38,271
Let's keep it tight. Get to work.

605
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:41,231
Where are my goddamn hostages?

606
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:44,189
<i>- Dad?
- Oh, thank God.</i>

607
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:45,709
<i>- Emily, are you okay?
- Dad...</i>

608
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,389
<i>Look, it's gonna be okay,
baby, I promise you.</i>

609
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:51,109
- Where are you?
- Where are you at? I'll come get you.

610
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:59,151
Where'd you send my daughter?

611
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:02,029
Downstairs. Across the hall,
second on the left.

612
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,354
Shut up!

613
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:39,470
Find him. Go!

614
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:43,953
- What's going on?
- What? I got it.

615
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:45,835
You better.

616
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,668
<i>Castle, this is Hummingbird.
We are on final approach.</i>

617
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:56,626
- What are we waiting for, Martin?
- Marine 1 is three minutes out, sir.

618
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:01,030
Castle, does anybody copy?
I repeat, we are...

619
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:08,349
Break right! Break right!
We are taking fire. Castle has fallen.

620
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:11,189
<i>The White House is down.
Heavy weapons on the roof.</i>

621
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,790
- Take him to the PEOC.
- They're in the building.

622
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:15,787
- We need to exfilt...
- I got this!

623
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:19,550
Mr. President, Mr. President,
I get you to the vault...

624
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,035
...their game is over.

625
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:23,550
You sure you can get me there?

626
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,945
Yes, sir. I am.

627
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:28,064
Then get me to the vault.

628
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:31,870
Diamond formation. Stay low,
stay close, shoot first. Got it? On me.

629
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:39,154
Do you have the vice president?

630
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:41,750
<i>- I repeat, do you have the vice president?
- We do.</i>

631
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:44,231
- We're two miles away from Andrews.
- The speaker?

632
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:46,625
Negative. We do not have the speaker.

633
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:49,190
- Please evacuate the Capitol.
- This way. Excuse me.

634
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:50,390
Kellerman!

635
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:52,512
Carol, COD says
we go to the Pentagon.

636
00:38:52,715 --> 00:38:55,070
I have the speaker.
Going to the secondary location.

637
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:57,272
Watch yourself.
Excuse me, ma'am.

638
00:38:59,995 --> 00:39:02,430
Downstairs, second door to the left.

639
00:39:08,595 --> 00:39:09,915
Emily.

640
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:30,194
No, no, no, please. Please don't!
I was just on the tour!

641
00:39:30,355 --> 00:39:32,426
- You had a gun!
- It's a phone, it's a phone.

642
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:35,388
- I swear. Look, I got a daughter. Please.
- Get up!

643
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:36,869
Okay.

644
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,786
That was close.

645
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:47,707
Shit.

646
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,025
You think you're tough, bitch?

647
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:57,995
<i>Keep the ground floor clear.
Package is on the move.</i>

648
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:05,388
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.
We are coming in hot.

649
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:08,388
<i>Copy that, sir.
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.</i>

650
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,553
GO, go!

651
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:16,787
Mr. President. Glasses.

652
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,511
Match. We're in. Go!

653
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:25,155
Go ahead. I'll button this up.
Go ahead.

654
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:29,786
<i>Mr. Vice President,
I apologise in advance...</i>

655
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:32,754
<i>...but this is gonna be the hardest takeoff
you've ever felt.</i>

656
00:40:32,915 --> 00:40:35,475
<i>We're gonna put this bird
at 30,000 feet in 45 seconds.</i>

657
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,510
James William Sawyer.

658
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:54,628
Gentlemen. What are you doing?!

659
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:57,785
Please, Martin, what are you doing?

660
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:01,192
I'm sorry, Ted.

661
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:05,991
- Martin!
- Consider this my resignation.

662
00:41:06,155 --> 00:41:09,511
Emily? Where are you at, baby?

663
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,064
Please tell me you got out of here.

664
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:16,393
Mr. Stenz.
We're in.

665
00:41:16,555 --> 00:41:17,875
I have the package.

666
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:22,834
<i>Ground floor, through the library
and down the stairs.</i>

667
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:26,346
<i>- The library. We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.</i>

668
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:34,272
That's the library.

669
00:41:35,355 --> 00:41:38,905
Don't go in there. Just...
Oh, this is so stupid.

670
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:42,747
You're not gonna get away with this.

671
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:44,394
Martin! What are you doing?

672
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:48,225
No, Mr. President. The question is,
what are you gonna do?

673
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:51,075
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?

674
00:41:51,835 --> 00:41:53,872
Is this about Kevin? Look, I'm sorry...

675
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:57,906
Run, Mr. President!
To me, to me, to me!

676
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:05,273
Move!

677
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:06,664
<i>Walker.</i>

678
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:09,235
Move, move, move!

679
00:42:11,315 --> 00:42:13,306
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

680
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:17,874
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
- Walker, I say again...

681
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,424
...we are coming to you,
we are on the move.

682
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:25,104
In the library.

683
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:27,232
- Shit. I'm empty.
- Walker!

684
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:33,314
Run, run, run!

685
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:36,110
Stenz!

686
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,468
No, not that way! They're up there!

687
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:45,469
Goddamn!

688
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:47,945
<i>We've lost the package.
Secure the exits.</i>

689
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:49,708
- Which Way's this go?
- West Wing.

690
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:54,986
Run, Mr. President! Move! Move!

691
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,504
This leads to the basement.

692
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:02,434
<i>- We 're in the stairwell, coming your way.
- Shit.</i>

693
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:11,954
We gotta go!

694
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:15,267
Elevator's here, let's go!

695
00:43:20,195 --> 00:43:22,914
Shit! God!
They're in the elevator heading up!

696
00:43:23,115 --> 00:43:26,187
- Cut them off in the Central Hall!
- What are you doing? Get him!

697
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:27,504
Take care of Bobby.

698
00:43:30,635 --> 00:43:33,354
<i>- Killick, stop them at the elevator.
- I'm on it.</i>

699
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,264
He's in the residence!
Cut him off at the residence!

700
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:40,946
Son of a bitch!
You screwed us, Walker.

701
00:43:41,115 --> 00:43:43,106
You've got one of your guys
running around.

702
00:43:43,275 --> 00:43:45,107
- Not one of my guys.
- Then who is he?

703
00:43:45,275 --> 00:43:48,028
I don't know, probably some schmuck
from one of the tours.

704
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:51,665
Your tourist killed one of my best men!
So now I'm gonna take care of it!

705
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:54,987
No, you will not.
You will have your boys...

706
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:56,987
...sweep every room in this place.

707
00:43:57,155 --> 00:44:00,034
And you will come with me,
as planned.

708
00:44:01,835 --> 00:44:03,234
Find him.

709
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:09,545
You don't talk to me like that
in front of my men.

710
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,069
- I don't, huh?
- No, you don't!

711
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:12,555
Ten years I've known Bobby!

712
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:15,468
Twice the guy saved my life.
This doesn't go unanswered!

713
00:44:15,635 --> 00:44:17,626
Drop the tough-guy shit
with me, junior.

714
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:19,234
Now, I know your story, Emil.

715
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:21,193
I know what this country did to you.

716
00:44:21,355 --> 00:44:23,710
We're in this together. So be calm.

717
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,104
- I'm calm.
- Good.

718
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:28,154
- I'm still gonna kill him.
- I don't have a problem with that.

719
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:31,671
But I need the president alive.
Don't forget that.

720
00:44:42,755 --> 00:44:44,826
You promised me the leader
of the free world.

721
00:44:44,995 --> 00:44:47,987
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
We'll get him back.

722
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:50,914
But without him, what kind
of time frame we looking at?

723
00:44:51,115 --> 00:44:53,948
We have 15 minutes to load in,
then maybe another 3O or so...

724
00:44:54,115 --> 00:44:57,233
...to crack the protocols without his code.
After that, it's on you.

725
00:44:57,395 --> 00:45:00,751
- What about securing the basement?
- I brought a party favour for that.

726
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:02,394
- Good.
- Do you know...

727
00:45:02,555 --> 00:45:05,866
...you've got a bit of something right...
It's right under your nose.

728
00:45:21,995 --> 00:45:23,633
Vadim.

729
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:27,150
You let me know the second
you find these guys.

730
00:45:27,315 --> 00:45:28,669
<i>Copy that.</i>

731
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:31,793
Somebody please shut the alarm off!

732
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:35,268
I got work to do.

733
00:45:36,475 --> 00:45:38,148
Motts.

734
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:40,784
Take Bobby's place in Air Comm.

735
00:45:42,995 --> 00:45:44,144
I'll show you the way.

736
00:45:44,315 --> 00:45:46,465
We got some important people
waiting for us.

737
00:45:51,435 --> 00:45:53,506
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm all right.

738
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:56,667
- Is your family in the complex?
- They won't be here till tonight.

739
00:45:56,835 --> 00:45:59,827
- Your daughter, where's your daughter?
- I couldn't find her.

740
00:45:59,995 --> 00:46:01,793
I hope she got out.

741
00:46:01,955 --> 00:46:03,309
Do you know these men?

742
00:46:03,475 --> 00:46:06,228
That old son of a bitch,
his name is Martin Walker.

743
00:46:06,395 --> 00:46:08,352
He's the head of my Secret Service.

744
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:12,224
You should have a conversation about
how serious you take your protection.

745
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,069
- I didn't pick him.
- Why is he doing this?

746
00:46:15,235 --> 00:46:18,034
I think it has something to do
with his son Kevin.

747
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,027
- Why? What happened?
- He was a Marine.

748
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:23,950
He got killed last year
in this covert action that I ordered.

749
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:27,949
Would he do this for a personal
vendetta? He said he wanted you alive.

750
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:30,785
There's gotta be a bigger play.

751
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:34,267
We gotta get out
of this elevator shaft.

752
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:35,869
I'm...

753
00:46:36,035 --> 00:46:37,867
Don't tell me you're claustrophobic.

754
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:46,864
Oh, my God.
The FAA needs to ground all air traffic.

755
00:46:47,035 --> 00:46:48,992
Where's the secretary
of Homeland Security?

756
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:51,994
- He's at the White House.
- Who's the deputy sec?

757
00:46:52,195 --> 00:46:55,506
Wyck Halsey.
He's also at the White House.

758
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:57,473
Oh, Jesus.

759
00:46:57,635 --> 00:47:00,866
<i>- -Happens,
our thoughts go to terrorism.</i>

760
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,108
I've had enough of this.

761
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:05,152
Walker told us to stay where we are.

762
00:47:06,635 --> 00:47:08,751
Madam Secretary, gentlemen...

763
00:47:08,915 --> 00:47:11,384
...I'm gonna ask you to accompany us
to the Blue Room.

764
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:13,990
- Who is this man?
- He is...

765
00:47:14,155 --> 00:47:16,874
- He's a concerned citizen.
- Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

766
00:47:21,635 --> 00:47:25,424
- You killed the secretary of defence.
- Well, he wasn't doing a very good job.

767
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:27,745
Okay, so,
would the remaining secretaries...

768
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:30,145
...please join us in the Blue Room?

769
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,591
- Sir, I'm on with Agent Reid.
- How they doing?

770
00:47:35,755 --> 00:47:37,473
VP just puked all over Air Force One.

771
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:40,434
I'm General Caulfield,
vice chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.

772
00:47:40,595 --> 00:47:42,586
Have the nuclear launch codes
been switched?

773
00:47:42,755 --> 00:47:45,793
- Yes, and new codes are active.
- The stock market's collapsing.

774
00:47:46,435 --> 00:47:49,109
Travis, I need you
to suspend trading immediately.

775
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:52,427
And there's gonna be a run on the banks,
so close them now.

776
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:03,274
- You guys good?
- Yes, sir.

777
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:04,954
Don't mess it up.

778
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:08,785
Son of a...

779
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:10,468
Captain, where are we?

780
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:13,787
We have reason to believe
that the explosive was a diversion.

781
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:15,070
Diversion from what?

782
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:17,385
An armed team
has taken over the White House.

783
00:48:17,555 --> 00:48:18,750
Do we have the president?

784
00:48:18,915 --> 00:48:20,952
I spoke to Walker.
He had eyes on Eagle.

785
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:22,708
Fifteen minutes is a lifetime.

786
00:48:22,915 --> 00:48:26,226
Radio chatter indicated they were headed
for the PEOC. No contact.

787
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:28,784
We have to assume
they've been compromised.

788
00:48:28,955 --> 00:48:30,753
We gotta get you to a phone.

789
00:48:30,915 --> 00:48:32,872
Call SEAL Team Six
and they come in here...

790
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,265
...and they'll shoot these assholes
in the head.

791
00:48:35,435 --> 00:48:38,826
- We keep a satphone in the residence.
- Great. Where's that at?

792
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:42,507
Of course it is.

793
00:48:42,675 --> 00:48:44,871
- You ever been rock climbing?
- We climbing this?

794
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:47,231
Unless you got a better idea, yeah.

795
00:48:47,435 --> 00:48:49,585
No, I don't.

796
00:48:49,755 --> 00:48:52,827
By the way, John Cale.

797
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:55,951
<i>- James Sawyer.
- I'll get you out of here, sir.</i>

798
00:48:56,155 --> 00:48:57,668
Just follow me up.

799
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:01,795
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

800
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,953
Make sure you have one handhold...

801
00:49:04,115 --> 00:49:07,346
- ...before you let go of the other one.
- Whatever you do, I'll do.

802
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:13,148
I ain't doing that shit.

803
00:49:16,315 --> 00:49:20,104
The scene here at the White House
is getting more chaotic every second.

804
00:49:20,275 --> 00:49:21,674
We have got hundreds...

805
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:24,714
As you can see,
the military's moving into position...

806
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:28,391
...but won't advance because of
safety concerns for the hostages.

807
00:49:28,555 --> 00:49:31,308
<i>- -Obvious to everyone,
this is the work of al Qaeda...</i>

808
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:34,228
<i>...or some like-minded
Arab terrorist group.</i>

809
00:49:34,395 --> 00:49:36,864
<i>- The National Guard...
- The building's buttoned up.</i>

810
00:49:37,035 --> 00:49:38,389
Rooftop's secure.

811
00:49:38,555 --> 00:49:41,308
- They attempted contact yet?
- Not yet.

812
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:43,989
- Apparently, we're all Arabs.
- Good.

813
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:45,748
- Cake?
- No, I don't want cake.

814
00:49:45,955 --> 00:49:47,548
I'm diabetic.

815
00:49:52,555 --> 00:49:54,273
Hallelujah.

816
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:59,709
This is my Graceland!

817
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:09,589
Sweet Shiva.

818
00:50:09,755 --> 00:50:12,269
Sugary pops of delight.

819
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,115
Come on, let's go! Move!

820
00:50:23,035 --> 00:50:26,505
Let's go, sheeple.
Now, welcome to my house.

821
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:28,746
Now, sit down and shut up!

822
00:50:28,955 --> 00:50:30,753
Oh, baby, I've missed you.

823
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:36,345
Let's get you plugged in.
You fit in nicely right there.

824
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:40,745
Ladies and gentlemen,
Skip Tyler has arrived.

825
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:44,590
By the time you're watching this,
I will have pulled off the greatest hack...

826
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:47,668
...the world has ever seen.
This is difficult for some, it is...

827
00:50:47,835 --> 00:50:52,955
...but for me, it's as easy as
one, two, three...

828
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:56,870
...four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

829
00:51:01,755 --> 00:51:04,554
Yes.

830
00:51:08,555 --> 00:51:09,784
Showtime!

831
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:23,830
Oh, some latecomers.
Secretary of Homeland Security...

832
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:27,351
...is in the house!
You're so getting fired for this.

833
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:31,150
- Look who was hiding in the Press Room.
- Oh, my God, Roger Skinner!

834
00:51:31,315 --> 00:51:35,149
The only one who speaks the truth.
I love your show. Seriously.

835
00:51:35,355 --> 00:51:38,507
After you, please. Get in there.

836
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:10,150
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

837
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:15,588
Playing some hide-and-seek, little girl?

838
00:52:15,755 --> 00:52:20,386
Well, then, I will huff, and I will puff...

839
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,990
...and I'm gonna blow your house down.

840
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:36,665
- No, no, no! Leave me alone.
- Get in here.

841
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,832
- Move!
- Mr. Skinner, please stop crying.

842
00:52:38,995 --> 00:52:40,986
Get comfortable, you little mutt.

843
00:52:43,075 --> 00:52:44,873
Are you okay?

844
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:49,667
- Oh, my God, where's my dad?
- He went looking for you.

845
00:52:55,915 --> 00:52:57,667
Excuse me for a second.

846
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:04,268
Sir?

847
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:05,948
Hi.

848
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:09,915
I understand that this is
a very high-stress time...

849
00:53:10,115 --> 00:53:13,710
...but if you and your colleagues...

850
00:53:13,915 --> 00:53:15,906
...could maybe be
a little more careful...

851
00:53:16,075 --> 00:53:19,193
...with the priceless artefacts
that are in this building...

852
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:23,349
...because I mean, it is a living history...
Okay, because see...

853
00:53:23,515 --> 00:53:25,791
...that was a Ming Dynasty
16th-century vase...

854
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:29,266
...that was a gift from
Queen Elizabeth ll. It's irreplaceable.

855
00:53:32,955 --> 00:53:36,789
I'll go sit down. I'm gonna... I'll be over
here if you have any more questions.

856
00:53:36,955 --> 00:53:38,753
<i>Vadim, Chen, report.</i>

857
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:42,271
We're done with the residence, boss.
Coming up to the third floor.

858
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:51,348
Shit.

859
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:55,433
Okay, I'm coming up.

860
00:54:13,235 --> 00:54:14,794
Get your head down!

861
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:33,913
What are you doing?

862
00:54:34,115 --> 00:54:37,346
- Trying to shoot off the cables?
- I heard something.

863
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:40,712
Come on. That thing's 100 years old.
The shit's too heavy for it.

864
00:54:40,915 --> 00:54:42,872
Let's unload before it snaps.

865
00:54:47,515 --> 00:54:50,348
- Jesus, they have Javelins.
- Javelin what?

866
00:54:50,515 --> 00:54:52,153
Surface-to-air missiles.

867
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:54,829
If anybody comes in by air,
they're done.

868
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:57,191
Mr. Speaker,
I have the vice president for you.

869
00:54:57,355 --> 00:54:58,709
- Alvin, you okay?
- I'm fine.

870
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:00,388
<i>Who's in command on the ground?</i>

871
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:02,387
- Well...
- Permission to speak freely.

872
00:55:02,555 --> 00:55:04,671
- Yeah, yeah, granted.
- It's a shit show.

873
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:07,873
D.C. police are on the scene,
FBI is trying to horn in...

874
00:55:08,035 --> 00:55:10,470
...plus Secret Service feels it
should be their show.

875
00:55:10,635 --> 00:55:13,673
It should. Carol Finnerty,
Secret Service.

876
00:55:13,835 --> 00:55:16,395
Mr. Vice President,
it was our building that was taken.

877
00:55:16,555 --> 00:55:19,388
Yes, it was, and now
you're standing in our building.

878
00:55:19,555 --> 00:55:22,707
<i>We need to send the Army in there
and take the White House back.</i>

879
00:55:22,915 --> 00:55:26,385
I don't think you can. Posse
Comitatus and the Insurrection Act...

880
00:55:26,555 --> 00:55:29,673
...make it very difficult to deploy
combat troops on American soil.

881
00:55:29,835 --> 00:55:32,509
Which is why we federalized
the National Guard minutes ago.

882
00:55:32,715 --> 00:55:35,389
Sir, with respect,
only the president can do that.

883
00:55:35,595 --> 00:55:38,314
Alvin, we're in
a constitutional crisis here.

884
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:40,426
We've never had
a missing chief executive.

885
00:55:40,595 --> 00:55:43,235
<i>We're gonna have to start talking
about the 25th Amendment.</i>

886
00:55:43,435 --> 00:55:45,551
You wanna remove the president
from power?

887
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:48,434
<i>I don't wanna do anything,
but I can't sit here...</i>

888
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,235
<i>...and watch the government come
crashing down around us.</i>

889
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:53,386
We've tried them on the phone
by now, right?

890
00:55:53,555 --> 00:55:54,704
Who?

891
00:56:07,795 --> 00:56:08,785
Hello?

892
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:12,949
Hello, this is Special Agent Carol
Finnerty. To whom am I speaking?

893
00:56:13,115 --> 00:56:17,109
That sounds official. Please hold.
Your call's very important to us.

894
00:56:19,475 --> 00:56:22,069
<i>- We've got an incoming call.
- About time.</i>

895
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:25,388
Put them through.

896
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:30,351
Thank you for holding.
I'll patch you through.

897
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:32,313
Have a great day.

898
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:35,467
Hello, this is Carol Finnerty.
Who is this?

899
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:37,865
It's me, Carol.
You should've called already.

900
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:40,544
<i>- Martin.
- We've held the building for 15 minutes.</i>

901
00:56:40,715 --> 00:56:42,752
- "We"?
- I'm sure you're recording this...

902
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:46,266
...so let's make this easy on everybody.
My name is Martin James Walker.

903
00:56:46,435 --> 00:56:49,154
<i>Chief of the presidential detail
of the Secret Service.</i>

904
00:56:49,315 --> 00:56:52,467
My men currently control the
White House and the 61 hostages within.

905
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,905
- What are you doing?
- I did you the courtesy...

906
00:56:55,075 --> 00:56:58,431
...of sending you out of here,
so let's just keep it professional, okay?

907
00:56:58,635 --> 00:57:00,387
"Professional"?

908
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:03,030
You killed your own men.

909
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:05,387
Where's Ted?

910
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,307
Killing Ted Hope...

911
00:57:08,315 --> 00:57:11,353
...was the second hardest thing
I've ever had to do in my life.

912
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,426
Martin, I want you to...

913
00:57:17,595 --> 00:57:20,553
There's not a thing you're about to say
that I didn't teach you.

914
00:57:20,715 --> 00:57:24,549
So we're gonna get all this done in
two hours and be done by lunch, okay?

915
00:57:24,715 --> 00:57:26,991
Now, ask me what I want.

916
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,311
<i>- What do you want?
- On any given day...</i>

917
00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:35,345
...the United States Federal Reserve
holds in excess of $400 million in cash.

918
00:57:35,515 --> 00:57:38,507
And I want it loaded aboard
a Boeing (3-17...

919
00:57:38,715 --> 00:57:42,709
...which you will leave fuelled and
otherwise empty on runway one-niner.

920
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:46,027
I'd like to know how you plan
on getting from the White House...

921
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:48,186
...to Reagan National
without being killed.

922
00:57:48,395 --> 00:57:51,672
We have eyes in the sky.
If I see a single sniper...

923
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:55,624
...within 10 miles of this place,
lam going to kill...

924
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:57,149
<i>...four Cabinet members...</i>

925
00:57:57,315 --> 00:57:59,875
<i>...and in a particularly nice
touch of irony...</i>

926
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:02,874
...the director
of Homeland Security himself.

927
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:04,713
Is President Sawyer alive?

928
00:58:07,475 --> 00:58:10,069
- Yes.
- I want proof of life.

929
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:13,307
You got two hours
or I will execute him myself...

930
00:58:13,475 --> 00:58:16,069
...on the South Lawn
of the White House.

931
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:20,594
<i>Jesus, the head of his own detail.</i>

932
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:22,746
At least we know
how they got in so easily.

933
00:58:22,915 --> 00:58:25,304
Can we be sure he's the only
Secret Service member...

934
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:28,155
- ...who's been compromised?
- Oh, go to hell.

935
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:29,385
Proof of life, huh?

936
00:58:29,555 --> 00:58:32,388
You say you can do better
than your men. Here's your chance.

937
00:58:32,555 --> 00:58:34,705
- Find him.
- With pleasure.

938
00:58:35,755 --> 00:58:38,907
Walker's wife, Muriel, is in Fairfax.

939
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,708
Could you find her, please?

940
00:58:42,635 --> 00:58:43,909
You Okay?

941
00:58:44,115 --> 00:58:46,391
I have Thanksgiving
at their house every year.

942
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:49,115
I wanna run the whole search again,
from the top.

943
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:52,074
Motts, meet me on the ground floor.
Chen, Vadim, the third.

944
00:58:52,235 --> 00:58:53,270
<i>Meet in the middle.</i>

945
00:58:53,435 --> 00:58:56,553
Roger that. I'm taking the stairs.
Mulcahy, finish up.

946
00:58:56,755 --> 00:58:57,825
That was the last one.

947
00:58:57,995 --> 00:58:59,793
Wait, so you said Walker's son died?

948
00:58:59,955 --> 00:59:03,789
The Pentagon thought that Iran
had a nuclear bomb. We sent a team in.

949
00:59:03,955 --> 00:59:06,265
Things went wrong.
Martin's son Kevin got killed.

950
00:59:06,475 --> 00:59:09,513
- You're telling me this is personal?
- He's not doing it by himself.

951
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:11,507
- Someone else is footing the bill.
- Who?

952
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:13,552
Heard of
the military-industrial complex?

953
00:59:13,715 --> 00:59:15,672
Those are the manufacturers
of the weapons.

954
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:20,147
They think they own the system and
they will do anything to keep that power.

955
00:59:20,635 --> 00:59:22,228
They profit off of your sacrifice.

956
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:24,784
Politicians always love
talking about sacrifice.

957
00:59:24,955 --> 00:59:27,231
Think I don't know anything
about sacrifice?

958
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:29,830
How many people come to your house
and wanna kill you?

959
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:32,072
Missiles are topside.

960
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:36,432
Elevator going down to one.

961
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:43,144
- We gotta get off on the second floor.
- What?

962
00:59:43,315 --> 00:59:44,908
Get off, get off, get off.

963
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:48,748
- You all right? You see anybody?
- No, we're clear.

964
00:59:48,915 --> 00:59:50,428
Kick it in. Harder.

965
00:59:55,515 --> 00:59:57,153
Mr. President, stay on my hip.

966
00:59:58,915 --> 01:00:02,033
I got three rounds. Tell me you got
some weapons in the residence.

967
01:00:02,235 --> 01:00:05,114
No, we usually have two agents
right there with machine guns.

968
01:00:05,275 --> 01:00:07,186
- We got some knives in the kitchen.
- What?

969
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:08,345
They're big knives.

970
01:00:08,515 --> 01:00:10,825
Great, then you can
make me a sandwich.

971
01:00:11,035 --> 01:00:12,946
Now, where's the phone?

972
01:00:19,275 --> 01:00:20,470
Right here.

973
01:00:20,635 --> 01:00:23,673
Walker set this number up.
Wait a minute, he's gonna trace it.

974
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:26,270
We gotta get in touch
with somebody on the outside.

975
01:00:26,435 --> 01:00:28,028
- I got somebody.
- You got somebody?

976
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:30,311
- Yeah, yeah.
- I need to get my shoes.

977
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:49,706
Needed this.

978
01:00:55,915 --> 01:00:58,145
- Hello?
- Jenna, this is John Cale.

979
01:00:58,315 --> 01:01:00,829
John, not a good time.

980
01:01:00,995 --> 01:01:02,394
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

981
01:01:02,555 --> 01:01:05,832
- Close friend?
- She works for the vice president.

982
01:01:07,075 --> 01:01:09,669
Have you heard what's happening?
It's not a good time.

983
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:12,554
I'm with the president.
We're in the White House.

984
01:01:12,715 --> 01:01:15,594
- That's not funny, John.
- Does this sound like a joke to you?

985
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,429
- Yeah, he's...
- Jenna, this is James Sawyer.

986
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:21,986
<i>For the past 10 minutes, I've been
getting shot at with this young man.</i>

987
01:01:22,155 --> 01:01:25,625
If you could connect me to whatever
control structure we still have left...

988
01:01:25,795 --> 01:01:27,945
- ...I would really appreciate it.
- Hold on.

989
01:01:28,155 --> 01:01:30,749
Hello? Thank you.

990
01:01:31,635 --> 01:01:33,034
She hung UP?

991
01:01:34,915 --> 01:01:37,714
She put me on hold
when I was thanking her.

992
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:43,592
So we wait for your best friend Jenna
to hit us back.

993
01:01:48,515 --> 01:01:50,028
You smoke?

994
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:53,348
Neither do I.

995
01:01:55,955 --> 01:01:57,275
This is your moment, sir.

996
01:01:57,475 --> 01:02:00,706
The country is looking for a leader.
It's your time to step up.

997
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,707
I told you, we weren't to be disturbed.

998
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:05,105
The president of the United States
called my cell.

999
01:02:05,315 --> 01:02:07,511
<i>- Mr. President.
- It's about damn time.</i>

1000
01:02:07,675 --> 01:02:10,235
<i>- Mr. President, are you all right?
- We're safe.</i>

1001
01:02:10,395 --> 01:02:12,068
- "We"?
- Yeah, I'm with someone.

1002
01:02:12,235 --> 01:02:13,748
I'm gonna put him on the phone.

1003
01:02:13,915 --> 01:02:15,633
- Hello, this is John Cale.
- Cale?

1004
01:02:15,795 --> 01:02:17,593
What are you doing
in the White House?

1005
01:02:17,755 --> 01:02:20,668
- He's doing a damn good job.
- It's a long story, Mr. Speaker...

1006
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:24,072
...but look, they've taken the building
and they're holding hostages.

1007
01:02:24,235 --> 01:02:26,795
- This is when you come get us.
- We're doing our best.

1008
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:30,311
- Do we have any intel on these people?
- We are working on that, sir.

1009
01:02:30,475 --> 01:02:32,432
You have to get the president
out of there.

1010
01:02:32,635 --> 01:02:34,990
- Can you get to the basement?
- Yeah, sure.

1011
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:36,953
<i>- Yeah.
- There's a series of tunnels.</i>

1012
01:02:37,115 --> 01:02:39,072
JFK used them to sneak Marilyn in.

1013
01:02:39,235 --> 01:02:41,146
- I thought that was a myth.
- It's true.

1014
01:02:41,355 --> 01:02:42,584
Donnie's gonna be pissed.

1015
01:02:42,755 --> 01:02:45,144
<i>Get to the basement.
I'll lead you to the tunnels.</i>

1016
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:48,871
Okay, Carol, I got separated from Emily.
Can you tell me if she made it out?

1017
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:53,029
We're gonna find her, but you have got
to get the president to safety, okay?

1018
01:03:01,715 --> 01:03:04,434
Cale? Cale?
Can you get him back?

1019
01:03:39,155 --> 01:03:40,225
Son of a bitch!

1020
01:03:54,715 --> 01:03:57,992
Get your hands off my Jordans!

1021
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:10,585
Freeze! I said freeze!

1022
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:12,029
Shoot him!

1023
01:04:12,635 --> 01:04:13,705
No, don't shoot him.

1024
01:04:18,835 --> 01:04:20,269
Shoot him!

1025
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,754
Shit.

1026
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:38,391
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1027
01:04:38,595 --> 01:04:40,188
Don't worry about him.

1028
01:04:40,355 --> 01:04:44,144
He would've killed me
if you wouldn't have killed him.

1029
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:48,627
Thanks, asshole.

1030
01:04:48,795 --> 01:04:50,945
Look what I found. Merry Christmas.

1031
01:04:51,115 --> 01:04:53,470
- You got the satphone?
- Right here.

1032
01:04:53,635 --> 01:04:54,955
And it's on.

1033
01:04:56,915 --> 01:05:00,146
- Mr. President, are you okay?
- Define "okay."

1034
01:05:00,315 --> 01:05:01,714
<i>What happened, John?</i>

1035
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,151
We got two dead bad guys,
that's what happened.

1036
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:07,865
These guys had military training. You
gotta find out what they're doing here.

1037
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:09,184
<i>Walker demanded a ransom.</i>

1038
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:11,995
You think they're going through this
for money?

1039
01:05:12,155 --> 01:05:14,226
<i>- You need to see this.
- Hang on, John.</i>

1040
01:05:14,395 --> 01:05:16,306
<i>...people watching all of this together.</i>

1041
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:19,547
<i>No doubt young Emily Cale
had to risk her own life to...</i>

1042
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,913
Can you get me the president here?
Cale, can you turn on the news?

1043
01:05:24,075 --> 01:05:25,668
You got a TV?

1044
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:28,429
We need to find out how Walker
found these guys.

1045
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:31,155
<i>- John, you've gotta turn on the news.
- What's going on?</i>

1046
01:05:31,355 --> 01:05:32,470
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1047
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:35,787
<i>What you are seeing really is
just amazing footage...</i>

1048
01:05:35,955 --> 01:05:40,791
<i>...captured by an extremely brave
young girl by the name of Emily Cale.</i>

1049
01:05:40,955 --> 01:05:44,789
<i>Now, these are the first images coming
to us from inside the White House...</i>

1050
01:05:44,995 --> 01:05:47,430
<i>...from inside this hostage situation.</i>

1051
01:05:47,595 --> 01:05:52,351
<i>The images have gone viral. They've
had more than a hundred million...</i>

1052
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,153
Wait.
Cale, Cale, listen.

1053
01:05:54,715 --> 01:05:57,150
We're all walking out of here together,
okay?

1054
01:05:57,315 --> 01:05:58,794
I gotta go get her.

1055
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,184
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

1056
01:06:00,355 --> 01:06:03,552
Get me facial recognition
on everyone in that video now.

1057
01:06:03,715 --> 01:06:06,707
<i>- -Very brave young girl
named Emily Cale.</i>

1058
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:08,866
<i>The hostages include the nine girls...</i>

1059
01:06:09,035 --> 01:06:11,834
<i>...from Watkins Charter School
in Louisville...</i>

1060
01:06:11,995 --> 01:06:13,872
<i>...five Cabinet members as well...</i>

1061
01:06:14,035 --> 01:06:17,915
<i>...and also, understandably,
a very emotional Roger Skinner.</i>

1062
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:19,867
<i>And from what I understand now...</i>

1063
01:06:30,915 --> 01:06:33,907
I got the president a scrambled
satphone to call his family with.

1064
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:37,545
<i>He keeps it in his bedside table
in the residence. See if it's still there.</i>

1065
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:41,025
No. No.

1066
01:06:50,035 --> 01:06:53,710
Vadim, would you be kind enough
to confirm your last name for me, please?

1067
01:06:55,035 --> 01:06:57,311
- Let's go.
- They're in the residence.

1068
01:06:57,475 --> 01:06:58,988
Go! That's them in the residence.

1069
01:07:01,195 --> 01:07:02,594
Easy.

1070
01:07:09,035 --> 01:07:11,675
<i>...And the faces of the terrorists.</i>

1071
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:13,548
You gotta be shitting me.

1072
01:07:13,715 --> 01:07:16,753
<i>So we are going to put those faces
up on-screen right now...</i>

1073
01:07:16,915 --> 01:07:18,269
In here!

1074
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:21,348
<i>As we put these faces up on-screen,
we are sure that we will...</i>

1075
01:07:21,515 --> 01:07:24,189
<i>...no doubt learn the names
of the men who are...</i>

1076
01:07:24,355 --> 01:07:26,710
<i>...holding the White House hostage.</i>

1077
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,106
<i>These men are clearly not al Qaeda.</i>

1078
01:07:30,275 --> 01:07:33,870
<i>We are positive
that the FBI will have...</i>

1079
01:07:34,035 --> 01:07:36,948
<i>...those images out.
So again, these are images...</i>

1080
01:07:37,115 --> 01:07:38,833
<i>...captured by a brave young girl...</i>

1081
01:07:39,235 --> 01:07:41,909
How many more ways can you guys
screw this thing up?

1082
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:46,354
Hey.

1083
01:07:46,915 --> 01:07:50,465
How you like your chair?
You comfortable, Mr. Skinner?

1084
01:07:50,635 --> 01:07:52,592
Let me ask you a question.

1085
01:07:52,755 --> 01:07:55,315
Where do you come up with
all the ideas for your show?

1086
01:07:57,235 --> 01:07:59,146
- I...
- You got guys who do that for you?

1087
01:07:59,835 --> 01:08:03,112
Because, believe me,
I got some good ideas.

1088
01:08:17,835 --> 01:08:18,984
Hey!

1089
01:08:24,115 --> 01:08:25,469
Give it to me.

1090
01:08:37,195 --> 01:08:40,347
Congratulations, asshole,
you just made us all famous.

1091
01:08:43,115 --> 01:08:46,870
When they come for us,
you're gonna die first.

1092
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:49,874
Get away from me.

1093
01:08:50,515 --> 01:08:53,394
- You understand?
- Get away from me.

1094
01:09:08,155 --> 01:09:11,352
<i>Sir, we have facial recognition
coming up right now.</i>

1095
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:15,073
Carl Killick.
This guy's a right-wing sociopath.

1096
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:18,546
First arrested at age 12.
Tried to blow up his local post office...

1097
01:09:18,715 --> 01:09:21,150
...because they employed
too many African-Americans.

1098
01:09:21,315 --> 01:09:22,908
Last seen with Conrad Cern.

1099
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,554
I saw that guy at the Capitol.

1100
01:09:24,755 --> 01:09:27,395
<i>He runs a white-power hate blog
against President Sawyer.</i>

1101
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:30,587
- Lovely.
- Jesus. Skip Tyler.

1102
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:32,826
King of the hackers.
Worked for the NSA.

1103
01:09:32,995 --> 01:09:35,464
Was fired for rewriting
nuclear launch coordinates...

1104
01:09:35,635 --> 01:09:37,592
...to target Apple headquarters.

1105
01:09:37,755 --> 01:09:40,269
He was unhappy
with their music-sharing polices.

1106
01:09:40,435 --> 01:09:42,267
Walker's been after this guy forever.

1107
01:09:42,435 --> 01:09:45,427
<i>And Emil Stenz. Ex-Delta Force.</i>

1108
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:46,915
<i>Highly decorated.</i>

1109
01:09:47,115 --> 01:09:48,594
I'm afraid we know this guy too.

1110
01:09:48,755 --> 01:09:50,905
- How?
- Unfortunately, that's classified.

1111
01:09:51,115 --> 01:09:54,346
Well, I hereby declassify it.
Now, you wanna share it with the group?

1112
01:09:54,515 --> 01:09:57,109
Stenz did off-the-books wetwork
for us in Pakistan...

1113
01:09:57,275 --> 01:09:59,107
<i>...as part of a black-bag
CIA operation.</i>

1114
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:02,233
<i>When the Sawyer administration
came in, the new secretary of defence...</i>

1115
01:10:02,395 --> 01:10:04,864
...shut down the operation
and disavowed its assets...

1116
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:07,345
...including Stenz.
His identity was compromised.

1117
01:10:07,515 --> 01:10:10,428
He wound up spending two years
in a Taliban-controlled prison.

1118
01:10:10,635 --> 01:10:13,104
- No wonder he's pissed at us.
- It's the threat matrix.

1119
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,425
Every day the Secret Service
does a rundown...

1120
01:10:15,595 --> 01:10:18,826
...of threats against the president.
Every one of these guys was on it.

1121
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:21,305
It's like Walker used
it as a shopping list.

1122
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:23,307
Sir, Delta Force is 15 minutes out.

1123
01:10:23,475 --> 01:10:27,309
<i>All right, general. I want them prepped
for an attack on the White House...</i>

1124
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:29,910
<i>- ...as soon as I give the word.
- Sir, please! Please.</i>

1125
01:10:30,115 --> 01:10:31,913
Only the president can give that order.

1126
01:10:32,115 --> 01:10:34,470
<i>The president is behind enemy lines
and compromised.</i>

1127
01:10:34,635 --> 01:10:38,515
<i>I'm calling the Cabinet together
to invoke the 25th.</i>

1128
01:10:38,675 --> 01:10:40,313
<i>Get behind this, Eli.</i>

1129
01:10:41,115 --> 01:10:43,072
<i>What if this were even a coup d'état?</i>

1130
01:10:43,235 --> 01:10:44,669
<i>Come on, that's just nonsense.</i>

1131
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:47,071
<i>Why isn't the military doing anything?</i>

1132
01:10:47,235 --> 01:10:49,988
<i>You gotta understand,
this is a very difficult situation...</i>

1133
01:10:50,155 --> 01:10:53,910
<i>...for the Pentagon, there are hostages.
You can't bring the big guns out...</i>

1134
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:57,033
<i>...because there's a class
of little schoolgirls still inside.</i>

1135
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:14,469
- Martin!
- Good morning, boys.

1136
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:16,034
Move, move!

1137
01:11:18,355 --> 01:11:19,629
Come on, go, go, go!

1138
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:23,669
- They're in the ground-floor kitchen.
- That's it.

1139
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,786
Come on, go, go, go!
Where's the basement?

1140
01:11:25,955 --> 01:11:27,628
Through here. To the left.

1141
01:11:46,955 --> 01:11:48,354
- Shit!
- They're gone.

1142
01:11:48,515 --> 01:11:50,028
Goddamn it!

1143
01:11:51,355 --> 01:11:54,905
<i>- I have the president and Cale calling.
- Cale, give me your location.</i>

1144
01:11:55,115 --> 01:11:58,392
All right, we're in the basement.
There's a gate with a keypad.

1145
01:11:59,075 --> 01:12:01,988
Okay, the code is 64762.

1146
01:12:04,075 --> 01:12:05,190
All right, we're in.

1147
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:08,746
Go down the hallway. That should be
the entrance to the catacombs.

1148
01:12:08,915 --> 01:12:10,667
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1149
01:12:11,355 --> 01:12:15,633
You should then be in a big oval room.
There'll be five tunnels.

1150
01:12:15,795 --> 01:12:18,184
Take the second tunnel,
follow it all the way out...

1151
01:12:18,355 --> 01:12:21,029
- ...and we'll be waiting.
- We found it. Mr. President...

1152
01:12:21,195 --> 01:12:22,390
...take this.

1153
01:12:22,555 --> 01:12:24,432
- I can't go.
- What are you talking about?

1154
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,905
- I'm not leaving my little girl.
- Then I'm staying.

1155
01:12:27,075 --> 01:12:29,146
You gotta go back
to being president, sir.

1156
01:12:29,355 --> 01:12:32,552
- Otherwise, all this is for nothing.
- You can't do this by yourself.

1157
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:37,266
You're gonna go and send the Marines
in here to get us, okay? Promise me.

1158
01:12:37,435 --> 01:12:38,755
All right.

1159
01:12:40,115 --> 01:12:42,231
You got my word. Thanks, John.

1160
01:12:42,395 --> 01:12:43,430
All right.

1161
01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:50,744
See you outside.

1162
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:07,629
They are in the basement.

1163
01:13:07,795 --> 01:13:10,913
All right, everyone in the basement!
The basement!

1164
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,468
Cale, come check this out.

1165
01:13:15,955 --> 01:13:17,866
Okay, please don't touch my toys.

1166
01:13:18,555 --> 01:13:22,150
That's something
that we do not wanna touch.

1167
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,464
Carol, we got a problem.

1168
01:13:23,635 --> 01:13:26,548
The exit tunnel's wired with explosives.
We need another exit.

1169
01:13:26,715 --> 01:13:28,228
There isn't another exit.

1170
01:13:29,355 --> 01:13:30,629
It's locked!

1171
01:13:30,835 --> 01:13:33,987
- Tyler, I need the gate code.
- I have that right here.

1172
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:35,475
Here's your gate code.

1173
01:13:35,675 --> 01:13:37,427
This is not happening.
We gotta move.

1174
01:13:37,635 --> 01:13:39,626
- Carol, where are we going?
- Hold on.

1175
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:41,194
I can't hold on.

1176
01:13:44,235 --> 01:13:45,828
We need a location right now!

1177
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,469
Stagecoach. Follow me.
Let's get to the Stagecoach.

1178
01:13:49,795 --> 01:13:51,149
No, no, no, you'll be trapped.

1179
01:13:52,915 --> 01:13:55,828
This is a bad idea.
They grounded all aircraft.

1180
01:13:55,995 --> 01:13:59,306
This is Jack Freeman reporting live
from the skies over Washington, D.C.

1181
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:03,594
We're bringing you exclusive images
of the terrorist-held White House.

1182
01:14:03,755 --> 01:14:05,189
Clear left.

1183
01:14:09,715 --> 01:14:12,787
Cabinet is assembling with
the vice president to invoke the 25th.

1184
01:14:12,955 --> 01:14:15,595
<i>Cale, if you don't get him out
in the next five minutes...</i>

1185
01:14:15,795 --> 01:14:19,504
<i>- ...he might not be president anymore.
- You didn't give me the job, remember?</i>

1186
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:22,432
What's the code to D227?

1187
01:14:23,035 --> 01:14:24,867
What's the code for D227?

1188
01:14:25,035 --> 01:14:26,264
Hold on.

1189
01:14:26,475 --> 01:14:28,512
Fast! Go, go, go! Go, go!

1190
01:14:31,355 --> 01:14:32,550
13350.

1191
01:14:36,795 --> 01:14:38,194
We're in, let's go!

1192
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:40,505
- Go, I'll cover you!
- All right, all right!

1193
01:14:42,955 --> 01:14:46,073
This way, Cale. The keys.

1194
01:14:52,915 --> 01:14:54,189
Got them!

1195
01:14:55,755 --> 01:14:58,395
What the hell
are you getting in the back for?

1196
01:14:58,555 --> 01:14:59,909
Sorry, force of habit.

1197
01:15:12,115 --> 01:15:14,629
Damn it! Keys! Let's go! Let's go!

1198
01:15:19,075 --> 01:15:20,713
- I'm crashing the gate.
- No, no, no!

1199
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:24,425
It's 8 feet tall and dual-hardened steel.
We're not gonna make it. Left!

1200
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:30,073
- Where's the garage clicker?
- You kidding? I don't have a clicker.

1201
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:31,748
Suburban!

1202
01:15:32,675 --> 01:15:36,225
I think I'm seeing the presidential limo
driving across the grounds.

1203
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:41,226
We're gonna cut them off!
Hang on, Motts!

1204
01:15:41,395 --> 01:15:43,386
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

1205
01:15:44,075 --> 01:15:45,952
Cale, they're in heavy weapons
follow-up.

1206
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,913
What do you mean, "heavy weapon"?

1207
01:15:49,595 --> 01:15:51,188
You gotta be kidding me right now!

1208
01:15:53,675 --> 01:15:54,949
Move!

1209
01:15:58,435 --> 01:16:00,665
Oh, my goodness!
The presidential limo...

1210
01:16:00,835 --> 01:16:03,748
...has just burst onto the South Lawn!

1211
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,984
- So sorry.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the Cabinet...

1212
01:16:08,155 --> 01:16:10,908
- ...it's with a heavy heart...
- Sir, you have to see this!

1213
01:16:11,555 --> 01:16:14,308
<i>It's trying to make its way
around the South Lawn fountain.</i>

1214
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:16,785
<i>That iconic fountain
that everybody knows...</i>

1215
01:16:16,955 --> 01:16:19,265
<i>...anyone who's ever been
to the White House knows.</i>

1216
01:16:19,635 --> 01:16:21,785
Box them in! Go for the window, Motts!

1217
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:28,152
Tanks. We got tanks.
Let's put them to use.

1218
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:31,149
I think that's my dad.

1219
01:16:31,315 --> 01:16:33,591
I'm not sure using heavy artillery
is a wise...

1220
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,905
I don't give a damn. You get that tank...

1221
01:16:36,075 --> 01:16:38,669
- ...you put a hole in the goddamn fence!
- Yeah! Come on!

1222
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:41,705
Look, look, look!
Watch him, watch him, watch him.

1223
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,912
Go for the windshield! Go!

1224
01:16:48,515 --> 01:16:51,029
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
- Get your head down.

1225
01:17:05,795 --> 01:17:07,706
- Yeah, that's one down.
- Shit!

1226
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:09,707
- Commander, are you in position?
- Roger.

1227
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,674
- Then go to work.
- Fall back! Fall back!

1228
01:17:14,035 --> 01:17:15,184
Driver, advance!

1229
01:17:15,395 --> 01:17:18,990
We don't know what is happening exactly,
but the National Guard is in fact...

1230
01:17:19,155 --> 01:17:21,385
...enacting some sort of manoeuvre.
It depends...

1231
01:17:23,595 --> 01:17:25,472
RPG'S! Now!

1232
01:17:27,955 --> 01:17:30,071
Blow these bastards off the roof.

1233
01:17:33,555 --> 01:17:35,353
- Take cover!
- Fire!

1234
01:17:45,515 --> 01:17:46,869
Incoming!

1235
01:17:52,595 --> 01:17:53,744
Commander, come in!

1236
01:17:58,555 --> 01:18:00,273
- Goddamn it!
- Shit.

1237
01:18:01,795 --> 01:18:03,706
Good job, boys! Great job, Mulcahy!

1238
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:07,755
<i>This is an unprecedented situation.
We have a full-scale war going on...</i>

1239
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:09,474
<i>...on the White House grounds.</i>

1240
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:12,195
Mulcahy! Take out the limo!
Let's go! Take the limo!

1241
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:15,991
<i>What are you waiting on? Take it out!</i>

1242
01:18:16,555 --> 01:18:18,068
<i>They're firing.</i>

1243
01:18:19,755 --> 01:18:22,588
- I can't see. What am I supposed to do?
- I need him alive!

1244
01:18:22,795 --> 01:18:24,547
- That's an order!
- Why don't you shut up?

1245
01:18:24,755 --> 01:18:26,985
There's a camera system
here in the car. There.

1246
01:18:27,155 --> 01:18:30,273
- What am I doing with zombies?
- It's my daughter's favourite movie.

1247
01:18:30,435 --> 01:18:32,267
Watch out, watch out! Left!

1248
01:18:34,515 --> 01:18:37,633
We gotta punch a hole in this fence soon
or we're dead in the water.

1249
01:18:37,795 --> 01:18:40,753
There's a weapons locker in the back.

1250
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:43,555
Jackpot!
'What you got?

1251
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:44,944
That's what I'm talking about!

1252
01:18:45,115 --> 01:18:47,948
That thing in your right hand is
a blast shield. Perfect.

1253
01:18:49,315 --> 01:18:52,626
Can you not hit me in the head
with a rocket while I'm trying to drive?!

1254
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:54,308
Get me to the fence, Cale!

1255
01:18:55,395 --> 01:18:59,184
- Stick that thing out there, go to work.
- Damn right.

1256
01:18:59,355 --> 01:19:01,824
Hold it with two hands, Mr. President.

1257
01:19:01,995 --> 01:19:03,747
Oh, my God, that's President Sawyer.

1258
01:19:03,915 --> 01:19:06,111
<i>- He has a rocket launcher.
- There's something...</i>

1259
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:07,993
...you don't see every day.

1260
01:19:08,195 --> 01:19:09,469
Here it comes!

1261
01:19:15,955 --> 01:19:18,947
- I lost the rocket launcher.
- How do you lose a rocket launcher?

1262
01:19:19,995 --> 01:19:23,954
<i>Killick, take one of the hostages outside.
Show them we mean business.</i>

1263
01:19:24,115 --> 01:19:25,628
<i>This just in from China.</i>

1264
01:19:25,795 --> 01:19:27,945
<i>- -destroyed the West Gate
of the White House.</i>

1265
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,984
- We got our exit.
- One more time around the fountain.

1266
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:33,835
- No!
- Get over here.

1267
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,709
<i>One of the terrorists
is holding a little girl at gunpoint.</i>

1268
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:39,435
<i>- What'd he say?
- Emily Cale is being held...</i>

1269
01:19:39,595 --> 01:19:42,747
<i>...at the White House balcony right now
by the terrorists.</i>

1270
01:19:42,955 --> 01:19:47,188
<i>She was the one who managed to send
this video out so the world could see...</i>

1271
01:19:47,795 --> 01:19:49,672
<i>- Another rocket.
- Cale!</i>

1272
01:19:51,755 --> 01:19:52,870
Dad!

1273
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:00,473
<i>I can't see what is going on...</i>

1274
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:02,512
Get me a location on them now!

1275
01:20:02,835 --> 01:20:04,746
- -The West Wing. The president has...

1276
01:20:04,915 --> 01:20:07,065
We're not sure if he's alive
or dead right now.

1277
01:20:07,275 --> 01:20:09,391
- The limousine has disappeared...
- Emily?

1278
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,273
<i>...The West Wing. I can't see him...</i>

1279
01:20:11,435 --> 01:20:13,028
Killick, take her back inside.

1280
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:16,068
- Dad!
- Get over here!

1281
01:20:19,955 --> 01:20:21,992
Shit. What the...?

1282
01:20:29,635 --> 01:20:32,070
- Something wrong with your radio?
- Malfunctioned.

1283
01:20:32,235 --> 01:20:35,068
Stay behind me. They won't shoot us.
They need me alive.

1284
01:20:35,235 --> 01:20:36,873
- Put a gun to my head.
- What?

1285
01:20:37,035 --> 01:20:39,231
That concludes
the running-and-shooting portion.

1286
01:20:39,395 --> 01:20:41,113
Stay back or I'll shoot him!

1287
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:44,984
Appreciate what you're trying to do, son.
Did the same job myself, and proudly.

1288
01:20:45,155 --> 01:20:48,352
I have no quarrel with you,
but I do have a deadline.

1289
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:49,710
So put the gun down...

1290
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:50,910
Pull the pin.

1291
01:20:51,075 --> 01:20:53,385
...because you're not
gonna shoot the president.

1292
01:20:53,555 --> 01:20:55,751
- You're right.
- Where does that leave us, boys?

1293
01:20:56,115 --> 01:20:58,265
That leaves us with this.

1294
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:01,387
Come on!

1295
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:02,750
Go, go, go!

1296
01:21:10,035 --> 01:21:11,787
What are you doing?!

1297
01:21:16,155 --> 01:21:17,190
Oh, no. Come on, go!

1298
01:21:17,355 --> 01:21:19,631
This way! Follow me! Follow me!

1299
01:21:25,235 --> 01:21:28,307
Enormous explosion
over toward the West Wing.

1300
01:21:28,475 --> 01:21:31,786
<i>I don't know if this means the president
has been killed. We know...</i>

1301
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:34,868
I got 100 people in here!
Somebody tell me something!

1302
01:21:37,955 --> 01:21:39,866
- You idiot.
- What'd you say?

1303
01:21:40,075 --> 01:21:42,464
You are an idiot.

1304
01:21:42,635 --> 01:21:44,308
You just blew our whole mission.

1305
01:21:44,475 --> 01:21:45,988
- Your mission.
- Shut up.

1306
01:22:02,595 --> 01:22:06,270
Mr. Stenz, this may be your lucky day.
Get your men back to the basement.

1307
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:12,151
I, Alvin Hammond, do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute...

1308
01:22:12,355 --> 01:22:14,631
...the office of president
of the United States...

1309
01:22:14,795 --> 01:22:18,789
...and will to the best of my ability
preserve, protect and defend...

1310
01:22:18,955 --> 01:22:22,789
...the Constitution of the United States,
so help me God.

1311
01:22:22,995 --> 01:22:25,794
Sir, follow me, please.

1312
01:22:35,715 --> 01:22:37,911
Place your hand there
for scanning, please.

1313
01:22:40,595 --> 01:22:43,064
Sir, these are your presidential
launch codes.

1314
01:22:43,235 --> 01:22:45,067
Keep them on your person
at all times.

1315
01:22:45,235 --> 01:22:48,273
<i>Vice President Alvin Hammond
has just been sworn in...</i>

1316
01:22:48,475 --> 01:22:51,308
<i>...as the 47th president
of the United States...</i>

1317
01:22:51,475 --> 01:22:54,786
<i>...confirming, of course,
the worst possible scenario...</i>

1318
01:22:54,955 --> 01:22:57,708
<i>...the death of President James Sawyer.</i>

1319
01:22:57,875 --> 01:23:00,549
<i>People all over the globe
have been holding their breath.</i>

1320
01:23:00,715 --> 01:23:04,231
<i>They're wondering what is happening
right here in America.</i>

1321
01:23:04,395 --> 01:23:07,831
<i>After all, the United States has the
biggest weapons arsenal in the world.</i>

1322
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:11,744
We need to start moving the money.
Maybe buy some time.

1323
01:23:11,955 --> 01:23:16,586
<i>- -Will he be able to get this extremely
volatile situation under control.</i>

1324
01:23:16,795 --> 01:23:18,308
Muriel Walker's here.

1325
01:23:18,475 --> 01:23:21,433
<i>Thousands are gathering,
leaving candles and ﬂowers...</i>

1326
01:23:21,635 --> 01:23:23,751
<i>...at the doors of the U. S...</i>

1327
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,189
We've got movement.

1328
01:23:26,915 --> 01:23:29,270
We've got movement
at the Federal Reserve.

1329
01:23:29,475 --> 01:23:32,228
<i>Stenz, do you hear me?
Confirming they're loading the money.</i>

1330
01:23:32,435 --> 01:23:34,267
<i>Let's wrap this up.</i>

1331
01:23:35,035 --> 01:23:37,265
Stenz, we're wasting our time here.

1332
01:23:37,435 --> 01:23:39,904
Walker, are you sure
they're down here?

1333
01:23:40,075 --> 01:23:43,955
<i>Did I spend 15 goddamn years
running this place or did you?!</i>

1334
01:23:44,155 --> 01:23:45,668
This guy is losing it.

1335
01:23:46,515 --> 01:23:48,472
What do we care if he gets the president?

1336
01:23:48,635 --> 01:23:49,909
We made a deal.

1337
01:23:52,675 --> 01:23:54,586
Cale was right.
This is not about ransom.

1338
01:23:54,795 --> 01:23:56,354
Walker has cancer.

1339
01:23:56,515 --> 01:23:58,552
His doctors gave him
less than three months.

1340
01:23:58,755 --> 01:24:01,429
He has a golf-ball-sized tumour
on his frontal lobe.

1341
01:24:01,635 --> 01:24:02,864
Jesus Christ.

1342
01:24:03,035 --> 01:24:05,424
I think he's on a suicide mission.

1343
01:24:06,915 --> 01:24:08,144
- You ready?
- Yes.

1344
01:24:08,315 --> 01:24:11,307
- What do you think you're doing?
- If anybody can talk him down...

1345
01:24:11,515 --> 01:24:12,789
...it's her, trust me.

1346
01:24:15,475 --> 01:24:18,627
A little birdie told me
you're finally moving the money.

1347
01:24:18,795 --> 01:24:20,308
<i>Martin?</i>

1348
01:24:26,355 --> 01:24:29,313
<i>I had to tell them
about the tumour, Martin.</i>

1349
01:24:32,675 --> 01:24:33,995
That's all right.

1350
01:24:35,515 --> 01:24:37,313
<i>Please stop this.</i>

1351
01:24:38,315 --> 01:24:40,750
Please just come home.

1352
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:45,992
I have to do this, honey.

1353
01:24:46,675 --> 01:24:47,745
No, you don't.

1354
01:24:48,435 --> 01:24:51,109
They have to pay
for what they did to Kevin.

1355
01:24:51,835 --> 01:24:53,234
<i>And when it's over...</i>

1356
01:24:54,995 --> 01:24:56,474
...I promise...

1357
01:24:58,275 --> 01:24:59,595
I promise you'll understand.

1358
01:25:08,995 --> 01:25:10,588
You're doing this for Kevin?

1359
01:25:11,475 --> 01:25:13,193
I swear to God.

1360
01:25:19,355 --> 01:25:21,744
Then you do whatever it takes.

1361
01:25:22,715 --> 01:25:25,355
You make them pay
for what they did to our boy.

1362
01:25:25,515 --> 01:25:27,313
What the hell are you doing?

1363
01:25:28,435 --> 01:25:30,028
<i>Walker, you stop this...</i>

1364
01:25:30,195 --> 01:25:33,665
...or I'll make sure she spends
the rest of her life in a federal prison.

1365
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:35,508
You have 19 minutes.

1366
01:25:40,275 --> 01:25:41,345
You're done.

1367
01:25:41,515 --> 01:25:43,506
- General.
- Your boss took the White House...

1368
01:25:43,675 --> 01:25:45,871
...and your man inside
got the president killed.

1369
01:25:46,115 --> 01:25:48,868
- Carol, calm down.
- You're free to go.

1370
01:25:52,235 --> 01:25:54,511
Thank God for Gerald Ford.

1371
01:25:54,675 --> 01:25:55,745
Why?

1372
01:25:55,955 --> 01:25:59,550
He built this because he didn't want
the press to see him in his swim trunks.

1373
01:25:59,715 --> 01:26:03,345
- Any chance this leads out of here?
- No. Listen, I gotta stop for a second.

1374
01:26:03,515 --> 01:26:05,745
What? You all right?

1375
01:26:06,315 --> 01:26:07,988
That's not good, is it?

1376
01:26:08,155 --> 01:26:10,066
- Stenz worked for the CIA, right?
- Right.

1377
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:13,270
If we can track the way
that Walker contacted...

1378
01:26:13,475 --> 01:26:15,751
...these guys,
we can figure out how to stop them.

1379
01:26:15,915 --> 01:26:18,668
- How do you propose we do that?
- Keep an eye on Caulfield.

1380
01:26:19,915 --> 01:26:21,064
Wait, what?

1381
01:26:23,235 --> 01:26:24,987
Hi. I'm Carol.

1382
01:26:26,675 --> 01:26:28,586
I'm not supposed to talk to you
right now.

1383
01:26:28,755 --> 01:26:31,554
Run a database search
on the guys in that building.

1384
01:26:31,715 --> 01:26:34,104
CIA, NSA, everything you've got.

1385
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:40,472
Okay, listen, Walker's not doing
this for the money, trust me.

1386
01:26:40,635 --> 01:26:43,548
- There is something else going on.
- I can't do that, ma'am.

1387
01:26:43,755 --> 01:26:46,793
On the worst day that our country
has ever had...

1388
01:26:46,955 --> 01:26:49,515
...you could be the key
to figuring all of this out.

1389
01:26:52,395 --> 01:26:55,751
<i>- -Could otherwise not accomplish that
is take back the White House.</i>

1390
01:26:59,555 --> 01:27:00,989
I'm gonna have to get that out.

1391
01:27:01,155 --> 01:27:03,271
When did you become a doctor
all of a sudden?

1392
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:06,826
Look, just talk to me, get my mind off it.
Talk to me about your daughter.

1393
01:27:06,995 --> 01:27:09,271
Emily?
She's completely in love with you.

1394
01:27:09,435 --> 01:27:13,224
- She even tried to get me to vote for you.
- You didn't vote for me?

1395
01:27:15,435 --> 01:27:17,631
Your daughter's smart.
You should listen to her.

1396
01:27:17,995 --> 01:27:20,748
She was like 3 when I enlisted.

1397
01:27:20,955 --> 01:27:22,832
And to be honest with you...

1398
01:27:22,995 --> 01:27:25,635
...I was probably just running
from my marriage.

1399
01:27:25,835 --> 01:27:28,111
Right after I deployed,
Emily was watching TV...

1400
01:27:28,275 --> 01:27:31,154
...and there was coverage on
the troops in Afghanistan.

1401
01:27:31,315 --> 01:27:34,512
She swears to me that she saw me.

1402
01:27:34,675 --> 01:27:37,747
After that point,
she became obsessed with politics.

1403
01:27:37,915 --> 01:27:40,145
And that's when she first saw you.

1404
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:42,990
The man that was gonna
bring Daddy home.

1405
01:27:43,155 --> 01:27:47,069
And when I finally did come home,
I realised that...

1406
01:27:49,635 --> 01:27:51,751
...I'm not her hero anymore.

1407
01:27:51,915 --> 01:27:56,512
So I guess I just figured that I'd try
to help protect the man that is.

1408
01:27:57,515 --> 01:28:00,155
Well, if she saw you today, Cale,
she'd be proud of you.

1409
01:28:00,315 --> 01:28:03,353
You know how when they're young
and they come running up to you...

1410
01:28:03,515 --> 01:28:05,870
...and they hug you
and they're shouting "Daddy"...

1411
01:28:06,035 --> 01:28:10,029
...and all of a sudden, one day,
that just stops?

1412
01:28:10,195 --> 01:28:11,310
Yeah.

1413
01:28:11,475 --> 01:28:13,830
I'd give anything for that hug
just one more time.

1414
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:17,468
You know, my daughter,
she's 15 years old, her name is Amber.

1415
01:28:17,635 --> 01:28:20,514
You know what she wants
for her birthday?

1416
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:23,554
- A belly button ring.
- Belly button ring.

1417
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:26,707
- What parent is equipped for that?
- Daughters.

1418
01:28:30,235 --> 01:28:33,353
<i>- What's happening?
- Attention, attention.</i>

1419
01:28:33,515 --> 01:28:38,225
<i>Everyone below Calico T-11,
please clear the ﬂoor immediately.</i>

1420
01:28:38,395 --> 01:28:40,227
Put the president on-screen.

1421
01:28:41,555 --> 01:28:44,115
Mr. President, Delta Force entered
Washington airspace.

1422
01:28:44,275 --> 01:28:46,391
I have Lieutenant Colonel Cameron
on the line.

1423
01:28:48,595 --> 01:28:50,950
You're online, sir!

1424
01:28:51,515 --> 01:28:53,074
<i>What do you have for us, colonel?</i>

1425
01:28:53,235 --> 01:28:56,034
We developed this plan
independent of the Secret Service.

1426
01:28:56,195 --> 01:28:58,914
<i>We'll use the superstructure
of the city to mask our approach.</i>

1427
01:28:59,075 --> 01:29:01,032
What if they start killing hostages?

1428
01:29:01,195 --> 01:29:02,833
<i>They're dead anyway if this fails.</i>

1429
01:29:02,995 --> 01:29:04,986
Alvin, please think about
what you're doing.

1430
01:29:05,155 --> 01:29:08,750
<i>May I remind you that you are addressing
the president of the United States?</i>

1431
01:29:08,915 --> 01:29:11,873
<i>Mr. President, I don't wanna write off
any Americans yet.</i>

1432
01:29:12,035 --> 01:29:14,424
<i>Trust me, sir,
we'll get your house back for you.</i>

1433
01:29:14,595 --> 01:29:16,586
<i>- Mission's a go, colonel.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

1434
01:29:18,195 --> 01:29:23,224
You heard the president.
Flight time to target: six minutes.

1435
01:29:23,755 --> 01:29:26,634
- So, what's it like being president?
- It's not like anything.

1436
01:29:26,835 --> 01:29:29,793
Once you get into office,
it's all about re-election...

1437
01:29:29,955 --> 01:29:32,071
...and what the other side
can use against you.

1438
01:29:32,235 --> 01:29:35,512
- Politics.
- You don't start out a politician...

1439
01:29:35,715 --> 01:29:36,785
...but you become one.

1440
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:39,788
Just once, though,
I wanna do something that's presidential.

1441
01:29:39,955 --> 01:29:42,993
Something along the lines of Lincoln,
Washington and Jefferson.

1442
01:29:43,155 --> 01:29:46,273
- You wanna make history.
- No. Not history.

1443
01:29:46,475 --> 01:29:47,988
I wanna make a difference.

1444
01:29:48,155 --> 01:29:50,908
If your little daughter
says that I'm her hero...

1445
01:29:51,075 --> 01:29:52,827
...then I gotta earn that.

1446
01:29:59,155 --> 01:30:03,308
All right, we go in low and quiet.
Time to target is two minutes.

1447
01:30:10,555 --> 01:30:15,311
- Falcon 2, maintain 3-0 feet.
- Falcon 1, copy, 3-0 feet.

1448
01:30:35,115 --> 01:30:38,665
<i>- Drop to 1-0 feet!
- Falcon 2 dropping to 10 feet.</i>

1449
01:30:41,315 --> 01:30:45,195
Complete chaos on the streets of D.C.
There's total gridlock through...

1450
01:30:45,355 --> 01:30:48,632
Oh, my God! U.S. Special Forces
are flying over us!

1451
01:30:59,715 --> 01:31:02,946
Shit. Sir, we have
Black Hawks coming in.

1452
01:31:03,115 --> 01:31:05,345
- Which direction?
- From I Street, and fast.

1453
01:31:08,195 --> 01:31:11,711
- How do you feel, Mr. President?
- Surprisingly good, Dr. Cale.

1454
01:31:13,395 --> 01:31:17,309
Let me call in, make sure
they don't think we're dead.

1455
01:31:17,475 --> 01:31:19,466
<i>The former vice president,
Alvin Hammond...</i>

1456
01:31:19,635 --> 01:31:22,514
<i>...is clearly calling the shots
as the new commander in chief.</i>

1457
01:31:22,675 --> 01:31:24,507
- I have John Cale on the line.
- Cale?

1458
01:31:24,675 --> 01:31:27,269
- Where's Carol?
- Finnerty's been relieved of command.

1459
01:31:27,435 --> 01:31:31,144
The cavalry's coming. Should be hitting
the residence in a few minutes.

1460
01:31:31,315 --> 01:31:33,704
No, no, no, not by air.
They have to come by ground.

1461
01:31:33,915 --> 01:31:36,555
- I think we can handle this.
- They have Javelin missiles.

1462
01:31:36,755 --> 01:31:38,109
Not according to our intel.

1463
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:41,347
Even if we wanted to call them back,
they've gone dark.

1464
01:31:41,515 --> 01:31:44,871
If they fail, they're going to kill
every single one of those hostages...

1465
01:31:45,035 --> 01:31:47,072
- ...including my daughter.
- Just go.

1466
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:49,465
Take this and stay out of sight.

1467
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:58,871
- Thirty seconds!
- Let's go!

1468
01:31:59,035 --> 01:32:01,265
Incoming, three of them!
Spread out!

1469
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:07,233
<i>Castle in sight.
I say again, Castle in sight.</i>

1470
01:32:07,395 --> 01:32:11,389
- Are you ready?
- Colonel, we got movement on the roof.

1471
01:32:11,555 --> 01:32:13,671
They've got missile lock!
Evasive manoeuvres!

1472
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:16,108
<i>Break right! Javelins! Javelins!</i>

1473
01:32:16,275 --> 01:32:17,948
<i>Shit!</i>

1474
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:20,755
- Break right!
- I can't hold out! We're going down!

1475
01:32:20,955 --> 01:32:23,629
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Shit.

1476
01:32:25,195 --> 01:32:27,789
Get down! Incoming!

1477
01:32:27,955 --> 01:32:29,104
<i>We're going down!</i>

1478
01:32:35,195 --> 01:32:37,072
<i>One is closing in on the White House.</i>

1479
01:32:37,355 --> 01:32:40,950
<i>Looks like it's checking on
the conditions of the hostages.</i>

1480
01:32:44,235 --> 01:32:47,148
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot the hostages?

1481
01:32:47,315 --> 01:32:50,785
Get on the 50-cal! Mulcahy, let's go!

1482
01:32:51,475 --> 01:32:52,795
<i>Hammer down! Hammer down!</i>

1483
01:32:55,315 --> 01:32:56,794
Fire!

1484
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:02,665
Pull up! Pull up!

1485
01:33:06,435 --> 01:33:07,709
Yeah!

1486
01:33:16,395 --> 01:33:17,715
Last mag.

1487
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:20,512
They've got missile lock!

1488
01:33:27,955 --> 01:33:29,025
<i>Movement on the roof.</i>

1489
01:33:41,955 --> 01:33:44,993
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I think that man is a friendly!

1490
01:33:53,275 --> 01:33:55,107
Get ready to deploy!

1491
01:33:55,835 --> 01:33:58,395
- Fast-rope down!
- Go, go!

1492
01:34:01,275 --> 01:34:03,505
<i>- Get us out! Missile!
- Javelin up! Javelin up!</i>

1493
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:04,745
Countermeasures!

1494
01:34:04,915 --> 01:34:06,030
<i>Brace for impact!</i>

1495
01:34:22,195 --> 01:34:23,230
No.

1496
01:34:33,035 --> 01:34:35,026
<i>This mission is going terribly wrong.</i>

1497
01:34:35,195 --> 01:34:37,914
<i>I can see now that there
are two men on top of the roof...</i>

1498
01:34:38,075 --> 01:34:40,225
<i>...and they're engaged
in hand-to-hand combat.</i>

1499
01:35:55,275 --> 01:35:56,788
Shit!

1500
01:36:21,155 --> 01:36:23,749
Yes! Skip Tyler is in!

1501
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:27,594
Walker, that last firewall
just came down.

1502
01:36:27,795 --> 01:36:29,149
Mr. Tyler...

1503
01:36:30,515 --> 01:36:32,347
...we are a go, sir.

1504
01:36:33,755 --> 01:36:35,587
God bless us all.

1505
01:37:02,195 --> 01:37:05,028
Sir. My weapons system
is coming online.

1506
01:37:05,675 --> 01:37:07,985
It's being accessed remotely. I can't...

1507
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:10,032
- Jesus Christ, it's targeting.
- What?

1508
01:37:12,715 --> 01:37:14,626
It's firing.

1509
01:37:20,115 --> 01:37:22,789
Target is an aircraft
somewhere over Ohio.

1510
01:37:22,955 --> 01:37:25,788
Appears to be a modified 747.

1511
01:37:26,595 --> 01:37:27,585
Oh, my God.

1512
01:37:30,115 --> 01:37:32,914
<i>This is an emergency.
I repeat, this is an emergency.</i>

1513
01:37:33,675 --> 01:37:35,268
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1514
01:37:35,435 --> 01:37:37,824
<i>- -And fasten your seat belts.
- I repeat, this is...</i>

1515
01:37:38,035 --> 01:37:39,389
Sir, we're under attack!

1516
01:38:04,355 --> 01:38:07,029
<i>It's clear that someone
on the inside has orchestrated...</i>

1517
01:38:07,195 --> 01:38:10,108
<i>...this takeover of the White House.
That's the only way...</i>

1518
01:38:10,315 --> 01:38:14,786
Mr. Speaker, we have confirmation
of ground impact.

1519
01:38:14,955 --> 01:38:18,107
- We're going to need to swear you in, sir.
- What?

1520
01:38:19,795 --> 01:38:23,231
Executive power passed to the
vice president when he was sworn in...

1521
01:38:23,395 --> 01:38:25,545
...which means the office
now passes to you.

1522
01:38:25,715 --> 01:38:28,150
- Sir.
- Please follow these men.

1523
01:38:39,475 --> 01:38:42,194
Sir, these are your
new presidential launch codes.

1524
01:38:42,355 --> 01:38:44,790
Please keep them on your person
at all times.

1525
01:38:44,955 --> 01:38:48,152
I need a moment here.
I need... I need to call my wife.

1526
01:38:48,355 --> 01:38:49,914
Of course, sir.

1527
01:38:50,075 --> 01:38:51,509
Thank you.

1528
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:56,068
Emily Cale.

1529
01:39:00,355 --> 01:39:03,108
How are you enjoying your tour?

1530
01:39:03,275 --> 01:39:04,345
Remember these?

1531
01:39:04,515 --> 01:39:07,189
You and I have a date, sweetheart.

1532
01:39:12,355 --> 01:39:14,665
You'll have to go through me.

1533
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:17,151
Really?

1534
01:39:21,035 --> 01:39:24,187
- You're gonna go to jail for that!
- And who's gonna make me?

1535
01:39:24,355 --> 01:39:26,266
The tourist is still on the loose.

1536
01:39:26,475 --> 01:39:30,184
But I have a hunch Daddy's
gonna come back for his little girl.

1537
01:39:30,395 --> 01:39:33,467
- So he's still alive.
- Not for very long, he isn't.

1538
01:39:34,675 --> 01:39:37,110
Don't screw up this time!
Motts!

1539
01:39:37,315 --> 01:39:38,749
You stay here with him.

1540
01:39:38,915 --> 01:39:42,749
Hey! Do I look like I need a babysitter?

1541
01:39:43,595 --> 01:39:45,393
Sit down and shut up!

1542
01:39:57,595 --> 01:39:59,074
Oh, shit.

1543
01:40:03,715 --> 01:40:05,752
- Mr. President.
- I...

1544
01:40:08,915 --> 01:40:12,067
NORAD is fully compromised.
Martin Walker now has the ability...

1545
01:40:12,235 --> 01:40:14,909
...to launch missiles at any target
in the United States.

1546
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:17,225
Our satellites show
massive troop movements...

1547
01:40:17,395 --> 01:40:19,671
...in Russia, Pakistan
and the Arabian Peninsula.

1548
01:40:19,835 --> 01:40:21,553
What are your orders, sir?

1549
01:40:26,995 --> 01:40:30,989
I swear to you all, I swear...

1550
01:40:31,155 --> 01:40:34,113
...that we are not beaten yet.
We are not!

1551
01:40:36,595 --> 01:40:37,994
No.

1552
01:40:40,435 --> 01:40:41,789
General...

1553
01:40:43,235 --> 01:40:46,034
...how soon can you execute an air strike
on the White House?

1554
01:40:46,195 --> 01:40:47,230
Sir.

1555
01:40:47,395 --> 01:40:49,750
We can have Raptors on target
in 10 minutes.

1556
01:40:49,915 --> 01:40:52,475
- Then do it.
- Let's go to work!

1557
01:40:52,635 --> 01:40:55,309
- Sir...
- Carol, we have to end this. We have to.

1558
01:40:55,475 --> 01:40:58,911
What if the next missile that he launches
is aimed at Chicago or New York?

1559
01:40:59,075 --> 01:41:02,591
- We're talking about millions of lives.
- Your first act as president...

1560
01:41:02,755 --> 01:41:04,666
...is going to be bombing
the White House?

1561
01:41:04,835 --> 01:41:06,633
Believe me, I know, I know.

1562
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:08,991
But our country is stronger
than one house.

1563
01:41:09,155 --> 01:41:13,706
<i>This is Mission Control. Raptor Alpha 1,
clear to initiate Operation Free Castle.</i>

1564
01:41:13,915 --> 01:41:16,145
Copy that, Raptor Alpha 1
beginning approach.

1565
01:41:18,915 --> 01:41:21,828
<i>We've lost two
commanders in chief in one day.</i>

1566
01:41:21,995 --> 01:41:25,670
<i>Look, Mark, if I'm a foreign head of state,
and the United States of America...</i>

1567
01:41:25,835 --> 01:41:27,746
<i>...has become
a rogue nuclear power...</i>

1568
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:30,987
<i>...at what point do I take action
and step in...</i>

1569
01:41:31,155 --> 01:41:33,624
<i>...perhaps even with
a pre-emptive nuclear strike?</i>

1570
01:41:36,675 --> 01:41:38,985
Brought you a present.

1571
01:41:39,155 --> 01:41:40,793
It's the tourist's daughter.

1572
01:41:42,235 --> 01:41:43,953
Well, hello, hello.

1573
01:41:50,595 --> 01:41:52,791
Good morning, Mr. Cale.

1574
01:41:52,995 --> 01:41:56,033
<i>I'm sitting here with someone
who would like to say hello to you.</i>

1575
01:41:56,195 --> 01:41:57,868
Say hello, sweetie.

1576
01:42:05,635 --> 01:42:06,705
Say hello, sweetie.

1577
01:42:09,195 --> 01:42:12,950
All right, then,
would you like to tell your father...

1578
01:42:13,115 --> 01:42:16,233
...what Mr. Stenz here
is holding in his hand?

1579
01:42:17,915 --> 01:42:20,714
<i>- A gun.
- Now, Mr. Cale...</i>

1580
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,513
...I'm gonna start counting here...

1581
01:42:22,675 --> 01:42:26,987
...and if you don't give the president to
my men by the time I've reached three...

1582
01:42:27,195 --> 01:42:31,746
<i>...Mr. Stenz here is gonna shoot
your little girl in the stomach.</i>

1583
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:35,910
One.

1584
01:42:41,915 --> 01:42:43,553
<i>Two.</i>

1585
01:42:47,275 --> 01:42:49,664
No. No. No.

1586
01:42:52,755 --> 01:42:54,712
I'm here.

1587
01:42:56,155 --> 01:42:58,544
Guess Daddy
doesn't love you after all.

1588
01:43:02,515 --> 01:43:03,744
<i>We got the president.</i>

1589
01:43:06,315 --> 01:43:09,592
- Bring him on down.
- Back to your office, sir.

1590
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:17,187
I have John Cale on the line, sir.

1591
01:43:17,355 --> 01:43:18,425
<i>Cale?</i>

1592
01:43:18,595 --> 01:43:21,064
You put her on the goddamn phone
right now.

1593
01:43:22,075 --> 01:43:23,793
- Hi, John.
- They have the president.

1594
01:43:23,955 --> 01:43:26,754
John, I want you to listen to me.
Help is not coming.

1595
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:30,431
- I said they have the president.
- They called a strike on the White House.

1596
01:43:30,635 --> 01:43:33,104
The vice president is dead.
You need to get out.

1597
01:43:33,275 --> 01:43:36,586
They cannot do that. They still
have hostages, they still have Emily.

1598
01:43:36,755 --> 01:43:39,395
<i>I'm so, so sorry.
I was wrong about you...</i>

1599
01:43:39,555 --> 01:43:42,832
...but there's nothing you can do, John.
If you stay, you're gonna die.

1600
01:43:42,995 --> 01:43:45,908
I need you to listen to me.
My little girl is counting on me...

1601
01:43:46,075 --> 01:43:48,066
...and I am not gonna disappear
on her.

1602
01:43:48,275 --> 01:43:50,425
<i>So you tell me how much time I have.</i>

1603
01:43:52,515 --> 01:43:55,633
You only have eight minutes left
to get them out.

1604
01:43:55,795 --> 01:43:57,229
Goodbye, Carol.

1605
01:44:01,315 --> 01:44:03,352
Clear out! We're moving back now!

1606
01:44:03,515 --> 01:44:06,029
Everybody's gotta move back!
Everybody move back!

1607
01:44:06,195 --> 01:44:08,994
What do you mean, evacuate?
My daughter is in that building!

1608
01:44:09,995 --> 01:44:12,589
This is an emergency. Move back now!

1609
01:44:12,755 --> 01:44:14,826
Please! Clear the area now!

1610
01:44:17,075 --> 01:44:20,670
Move back now!
I said move back now!

1611
01:44:22,075 --> 01:44:23,349
Okay.

1612
01:44:26,155 --> 01:44:28,431
Oh, there I am.
That's not a bad picture.

1613
01:44:30,675 --> 01:44:32,666
How'd they find out I did that one?

1614
01:44:35,315 --> 01:44:36,464
Buh-bye.

1615
01:44:37,275 --> 01:44:41,473
Whatever happened to
"the pen is mightier than the sword"?

1616
01:44:43,675 --> 01:44:46,064
Martin, as the president
of the United States...

1617
01:44:46,235 --> 01:44:50,468
...this comes with the full weight,
power and authority of my office:

1618
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:52,469
Fuck you.

1619
01:44:56,715 --> 01:45:00,549
- You okay?
- Can we get down to business now?

1620
01:45:01,315 --> 01:45:03,192
I'm gonna need you
to open this for me.

1621
01:45:04,395 --> 01:45:06,113
- What is that?
- Oh, what are you doing?

1622
01:45:06,315 --> 01:45:08,192
This is the nuclear football, sweetie.

1623
01:45:08,395 --> 01:45:13,674
It is keyed to the blood type
and heartbeat of the president.

1624
01:45:13,835 --> 01:45:16,065
- What the hell is this?
- This is the deal.

1625
01:45:19,115 --> 01:45:21,391
There's a dozen reasons
why that's not gonna work.

1626
01:45:21,555 --> 01:45:24,229
- Such as?
- Even if I open it, my codes are useless.

1627
01:45:24,395 --> 01:45:27,547
They switched them out
once you took over the building.

1628
01:45:27,715 --> 01:45:29,672
You let me worry about that.

1629
01:45:31,035 --> 01:45:35,154
There's not a day that goes by that I don't
feel terrible about losing your boy.

1630
01:45:35,315 --> 01:45:37,147
But that's on me.

1631
01:45:37,315 --> 01:45:40,353
So if you want revenge,
then just shoot me.

1632
01:45:40,555 --> 01:45:43,593
You think I blame you
for Kevin's death?

1633
01:45:44,075 --> 01:45:46,510
Sending those men in
was the most courageous thing...

1634
01:45:46,675 --> 01:45:48,188
...you ever did in your life.

1635
01:45:48,395 --> 01:45:52,070
You were a true commander in chief
for five minutes.

1636
01:45:52,275 --> 01:45:56,587
You just don't have the balls
to see the mission through.

1637
01:45:56,755 --> 01:45:58,234
What mission?

1638
01:45:58,395 --> 01:46:01,353
- There were no nuclear weapons in Iran.
- But there will be.

1639
01:46:02,875 --> 01:46:05,549
The Middle East is our last war.

1640
01:46:05,715 --> 01:46:09,345
It will be us or them.

1641
01:46:09,515 --> 01:46:13,793
I choose that Kevin Charles Walker
will be the last American soldier...

1642
01:46:13,955 --> 01:46:16,549
...to die in that conflict in vain.

1643
01:46:16,755 --> 01:46:18,189
You want that as your son's legacy?

1644
01:46:18,355 --> 01:46:20,266
Murdering millions of people
in his name?

1645
01:46:20,435 --> 01:46:24,793
Mr. President, I wish the pen
were mightier than the sword, I do.

1646
01:46:25,315 --> 01:46:26,953
But it's just a dream.

1647
01:46:27,115 --> 01:46:28,469
Stand up, sir.

1648
01:46:28,635 --> 01:46:34,711
History will judge who the true patriots
were here today.

1649
01:46:35,475 --> 01:46:40,151
I've been standing up, Martin,
and I'm not gonna open that.

1650
01:46:50,355 --> 01:46:51,629
Martin.

1651
01:46:53,435 --> 01:46:56,075
Martin, that's not necessary.

1652
01:46:56,235 --> 01:46:57,305
Martin!

1653
01:47:04,955 --> 01:47:06,673
How about now?

1654
01:47:09,075 --> 01:47:10,793
I can't open this for him.

1655
01:47:11,435 --> 01:47:15,429
If I do, millions of people are gonna die,
you understand that?

1656
01:47:17,195 --> 01:47:19,106
I understand.

1657
01:47:23,355 --> 01:47:25,426
Goddamn it!

1658
01:47:27,475 --> 01:47:29,307
Tyler, what the hell is going on?

1659
01:47:29,475 --> 01:47:33,230
We got thermal alarms going off
in the second-floor dining room...

1660
01:47:33,395 --> 01:47:36,035
...the West Sitting Hall,
and the president's bedroom.

1661
01:47:36,195 --> 01:47:39,313
Killick, he's trying to burn the place.
Second floor. Send your men.

1662
01:47:48,355 --> 01:47:52,474
Tyler? Turn off
the goddamn sprinklers!

1663
01:47:54,075 --> 01:47:55,827
Who makes this shit?

1664
01:48:16,235 --> 01:48:17,555
Oh, shit!

1665
01:48:21,715 --> 01:48:22,989
What was that?

1666
01:48:31,795 --> 01:48:33,752
I've been waiting all day to kill you.

1667
01:48:38,355 --> 01:48:44,112
Stop hurting my White House!

1668
01:48:45,715 --> 01:48:50,551
German mantle clock. Empire style.

1669
01:48:51,395 --> 01:48:52,954
<i>Killick, report!</i>

1670
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:56,389
Killick, what the hell is happening?
Report!

1671
01:48:56,555 --> 01:48:59,229
Killick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?

1672
01:48:59,395 --> 01:49:00,874
- Dad!
- She's here with me...

1673
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:04,630
...in the Oval Office, so why
don't you come down and get her?

1674
01:49:04,795 --> 01:49:06,945
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you think?

1675
01:49:07,515 --> 01:49:09,267
Why do you make
all this shit personal?

1676
01:49:09,475 --> 01:49:11,432
Oh, you're talking to me
about personal...

1677
01:49:11,595 --> 01:49:14,394
...when you wanna blow up
half the world for your kid!

1678
01:49:14,555 --> 01:49:17,468
- What are you gonna do?
- What I should've done in the beginning.

1679
01:49:17,635 --> 01:49:19,467
- I'm gonna kill this prick.
- Hey!

1680
01:49:19,635 --> 01:49:21,546
- What?
- You lied to all of us.

1681
01:49:21,715 --> 01:49:23,467
This was not the job.

1682
01:49:23,635 --> 01:49:26,104
I got business to finish. You stay here.

1683
01:49:26,435 --> 01:49:29,826
- How do I get to the Oval Office?
- Take the stairs to the ground floor...

1684
01:49:30,035 --> 01:49:31,992
...you go to the end
of the West Colonnade.

1685
01:49:32,155 --> 01:49:34,465
There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.

1686
01:49:34,635 --> 01:49:35,989
Go!

1687
01:49:36,675 --> 01:49:38,473
You heard the man!

1688
01:49:39,435 --> 01:49:40,948
Tour's over.

1689
01:50:02,275 --> 01:50:04,312
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.

1690
01:50:04,475 --> 01:50:07,194
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
get the money myself.

1691
01:50:07,355 --> 01:50:09,915
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

1692
01:50:10,915 --> 01:50:13,953
You think I put my country
through this for money?

1693
01:50:16,595 --> 01:50:18,586
I hate mercenaries.

1694
01:50:23,195 --> 01:50:25,186
It's about time.

1695
01:50:25,995 --> 01:50:27,429
I choose the pen!

1696
01:50:30,835 --> 01:50:33,634
Come here. Get up. Up!

1697
01:50:33,795 --> 01:50:35,308
Put your hand...

1698
01:50:35,515 --> 01:50:36,835
<i>Weapon system unlocked.</i>

1699
01:50:37,995 --> 01:50:40,669
<i>Enter presidential launch code.</i>

1700
01:50:40,835 --> 01:50:44,032
Mr. President,
please wake up, wake up. Please!

1701
01:50:48,515 --> 01:50:49,585
Sir, we're at DEFCON 1.

1702
01:50:49,755 --> 01:50:52,065
The nuclear football
in the White House went live.

1703
01:50:52,235 --> 01:50:53,828
- That's impossible.
- It's happening.

1704
01:50:54,035 --> 01:50:55,912
Someone has entered
valid launch codes.

1705
01:50:58,955 --> 01:51:01,344
- Captain on deck!
- What the hell is going on?

1706
01:51:01,515 --> 01:51:04,871
- All 24 of our nuclear missiles went live.
- This can't be right.

1707
01:51:07,075 --> 01:51:10,067
<i>Sir, we have nuclear missiles
spinning up on the Albuquerque.</i>

1708
01:51:10,235 --> 01:51:13,830
If our allies see us launching a full-scale
nuclear strike, they will respond.

1709
01:51:13,995 --> 01:51:16,635
Russia and China will launch.
We'll have World War Ill...

1710
01:51:16,795 --> 01:51:19,992
- ...unless you level the White House.
- Four minutes to target!

1711
01:51:20,155 --> 01:51:22,988
I need a final go-no go
for payload delivery.

1712
01:51:23,155 --> 01:51:24,907
God forgive me. Go.

1713
01:51:25,075 --> 01:51:27,828
<i>- Go!
- Raptor Alpha 1, Operation Free Castle...</i>

1714
01:51:27,995 --> 01:51:30,908
- ...is a go.
- Copy that. Dropping to attack altitude.

1715
01:51:40,435 --> 01:51:43,268
Cale, Walker's trying to launch
a nuclear attack.

1716
01:51:43,435 --> 01:51:45,346
<i>If he does, it'll start World War III.</i>

1717
01:51:45,515 --> 01:51:47,188
<i>- You have to stop him.
- What?</i>

1718
01:51:49,755 --> 01:51:52,269
Cale? Cale?

1719
01:51:55,435 --> 01:51:56,914
Head to the South Lawn!

1720
01:51:57,075 --> 01:52:01,034
Almost there. Come on.
Come on. Come on!

1721
01:52:02,795 --> 01:52:04,115
I'm gonna enjoy this.

1722
01:52:06,715 --> 01:52:09,389
<i>Confirm: Bandar Abbas.</i>

1723
01:52:10,795 --> 01:52:13,389
<i>Chah Bahar targeted.</i>

1724
01:52:13,555 --> 01:52:15,228
<i>Confirm Chah Bahar.</i>

1725
01:52:23,515 --> 01:52:25,233
- Go! Leave, leave, leave!
- No, no!

1726
01:52:25,395 --> 01:52:27,466
- Not without my dad!
- Go, go, go!

1727
01:52:37,115 --> 01:52:39,584
Your little bitch says
you're gonna put me in jail!

1728
01:52:49,315 --> 01:52:51,829
Come on, Martin. This isn't you.

1729
01:52:51,995 --> 01:52:55,829
You protected presidents
for the past 25 years.

1730
01:52:57,075 --> 01:52:58,827
What are you gonna do?

1731
01:52:59,035 --> 01:53:00,514
You really gonna shoot me?

1732
01:53:02,875 --> 01:53:04,434
All right.

1733
01:53:08,995 --> 01:53:10,030
Yes.

1734
01:53:16,555 --> 01:53:17,704
He deserved it.

1735
01:53:18,595 --> 01:53:20,666
You killed him!

1736
01:53:20,835 --> 01:53:22,667
Get back. Get over here.

1737
01:53:22,835 --> 01:53:24,712
Get in the room or I'll knock you out!

1738
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:26,991
And do as you're told.
Go on, sit down!

1739
01:53:36,515 --> 01:53:38,825
I'm gonna carve my name on your chest!

1740
01:53:49,755 --> 01:53:52,190
No jail for you, you little bitch!

1741
01:53:53,075 --> 01:53:54,907
No! No!

1742
01:53:57,755 --> 01:53:59,314
Get it off!

1743
01:54:03,035 --> 01:54:06,744
<i>There was an enormous explosion
in the vicinity of the West Wing.</i>

1744
01:54:06,915 --> 01:54:09,555
<i>A huge ball of flames
has burst into the sky.</i>

1745
01:54:09,715 --> 01:54:12,912
<i>- It's got to be more than 100 feet...
- Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear.</i>

1746
01:54:13,075 --> 01:54:15,589
Delta 2-6, copy that.
Two minutes to target.

1747
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:22,673
- Clear the area.
- Get back in there!

1748
01:54:22,835 --> 01:54:25,714
The Department of Homeland Security...

1749
01:54:26,955 --> 01:54:28,309
Get in there!

1750
01:54:28,475 --> 01:54:31,354
This is a mandatory evacuation...

1751
01:54:37,635 --> 01:54:39,148
Emily.

1752
01:54:40,035 --> 01:54:43,107
No, please, please, baby.
Look at me. I'm right here.

1753
01:54:43,275 --> 01:54:47,712
<i>Tabriz targeted. Confirm Tabriz.</i>

1754
01:54:48,675 --> 01:54:51,189
Please, baby, you gotta
turn around and look at me.

1755
01:54:51,395 --> 01:54:53,386
Damn it.

1756
01:54:53,555 --> 01:54:57,389
Evacuate this area immediately!
We need you to move back, people!

1757
01:54:57,555 --> 01:54:58,954
- Move back now!
- Emily!

1758
01:54:59,155 --> 01:55:01,271
Get out of here!
There's an air strike coming!

1759
01:55:01,435 --> 01:55:04,826
- My daughter was in there. Emily Cale.
- She's still in there. Wait!

1760
01:55:05,035 --> 01:55:08,312
- Emily!
- What is with this family? Wait for me!

1761
01:55:08,475 --> 01:55:11,308
<i>Confirm Tehran.</i>

1762
01:55:11,475 --> 01:55:13,989
<i>Targeting complete.</i>

1763
01:55:14,155 --> 01:55:16,271
<i>Armed for nuclear launch.</i>

1764
01:55:16,435 --> 01:55:19,666
<i>You have 15 seconds to initiate.</i>

1765
01:55:19,835 --> 01:55:22,395
<i>Fifteen, 14...</i>

1766
01:55:28,995 --> 01:55:31,509
<i>Nine, eight...</i>

1767
01:55:31,995 --> 01:55:34,509
- Dad! Dad, look!
- Five...

1768
01:55:34,675 --> 01:55:36,951
- Dad, in his hand!
- ...four...

1769
01:55:37,115 --> 01:55:38,833
- ...three...
- Emily, get down!

1770
01:55:38,995 --> 01:55:40,144
- ...two...
- Get down!

1771
01:55:40,315 --> 01:55:41,749
<i>...one.</i>

1772
01:55:48,835 --> 01:55:51,111
<i>Confirmation timed out.</i>

1773
01:55:51,275 --> 01:55:54,427
Delta 2-6, one minute to target.
Go weapons hot.

1774
01:55:55,075 --> 01:55:56,907
- Thank God, Em.
- Daddy, I love you.

1775
01:55:57,075 --> 01:55:58,145
You're okay.

1776
01:55:58,315 --> 01:56:01,194
- I love you so much.
- The president. He shot him!

1777
01:56:01,355 --> 01:56:02,868
He shot him in there.

1778
01:56:04,675 --> 01:56:06,313
Look, I need you to listen to me.

1779
01:56:06,515 --> 01:56:08,711
There's an air strike coming,
I need you to run.

1780
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:11,628
I need you to run as far and as fast
as you can possibly go.

1781
01:56:11,795 --> 01:56:13,752
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.

1782
01:56:13,915 --> 01:56:16,145
- Okay.
- You gotta go for me. Now, go.

1783
01:56:16,355 --> 01:56:19,154
<i>Hundreds of people seem to be
running toward the White House.</i>

1784
01:56:19,315 --> 01:56:23,388
<i>They've been told to evacuate too,
but they're climbing the fence.</i>

1785
01:56:23,555 --> 01:56:27,867
<i>Okay, we have confirmation. President
Raphelson has ordered an air strike...</i>

1786
01:56:28,075 --> 01:56:31,386
<i>...on the White House,
and I can hear the planes coming.</i>

1787
01:56:31,555 --> 01:56:33,228
<i>I... I have to go. I'm sorry.</i>

1788
01:56:33,395 --> 01:56:36,069
<i>Delta 2-6, requesting permission
to deliver payload.</i>

1789
01:56:36,235 --> 01:56:37,828
<i>Raptor Alpha 1, you are clear.</i>

1790
01:56:37,995 --> 01:56:40,066
<i>All right, guys, let's clean it up.</i>

1791
01:56:41,675 --> 01:56:45,748
Delta 2-6, we're locked on target.
Please confirm Free Castle is a go.

1792
01:56:45,915 --> 01:56:48,384
<i>Raptor Alpha 1, clear.
Mission is a go.</i>

1793
01:56:51,555 --> 01:56:54,229
Delta 2-6, we have friendlies
all over the kill zone.

1794
01:56:54,435 --> 01:56:58,429
<i>I cannot see the planes, but what
I can see is an unbelievable sight.</i>

1795
01:56:58,595 --> 01:57:02,190
<i>Emily Cale is out on the lawn,
and she's waving the presidential flag.</i>

1796
01:57:02,355 --> 01:57:04,585
No, baby. No, I told you to run!
You gotta run!

1797
01:57:04,755 --> 01:57:07,986
Captain, do you see this? Delta 2-6,
we have a young girl on the lawn.

1798
01:57:08,155 --> 01:57:10,351
I think she's trying to wave off
the air strike.

1799
01:57:10,515 --> 01:57:13,314
<i>- Sir, requesting permission to abort-
- Mr. President, please.</i>

1800
01:57:13,475 --> 01:57:16,035
Sir! Sir! I need an answer.

1801
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:20,792
I'm not doing this, guys. Abort mission.
Pull out! Abort! Abort! Abort!

1802
01:57:22,115 --> 01:57:23,344
No!

1803
01:57:25,115 --> 01:57:27,026
<i>They have flown
over the White House.</i>

1804
01:57:27,195 --> 01:57:29,471
<i>It is an unbelievable moment
down here.</i>

1805
01:57:29,635 --> 01:57:31,114
<i>People are going wild.</i>

1806
01:57:31,275 --> 01:57:35,712
<i>And Emily Cale is undoubtedly
a beautiful hero of the day.</i>

1807
01:57:35,875 --> 01:57:37,752
<i>Emily Cale is a little hero.</i>

1808
01:57:37,915 --> 01:57:41,112
<i>This is an unprecedented moment
in U. S. history.</i>

1809
01:57:58,395 --> 01:58:00,466
That search you requested
came back.

1810
01:58:04,515 --> 01:58:08,588
<i>Emily, can you believe how many people
have seen your video biog?</i>

1811
01:58:08,755 --> 01:58:11,110
<i>It's not a video blog.
It's a YouTube channel.</i>

1812
01:58:11,275 --> 01:58:14,427
<i>- How many?
- Seven hundred million people.</i>

1813
01:58:14,595 --> 01:58:16,233
Daughters.

1814
01:58:16,435 --> 01:58:17,664
Jesus!

1815
01:58:18,235 --> 01:58:20,067
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1816
01:58:21,755 --> 01:58:24,429
Honest Abe. My wife got this for me.

1817
01:58:24,595 --> 01:58:26,472
For the inauguration.

1818
01:58:30,155 --> 01:58:32,271
Are you kidding me?
You got shot in the wa...?

1819
01:58:32,435 --> 01:58:37,111
What I'm telling you is that good old Abe
took a second bullet for me.

1820
01:58:41,635 --> 01:58:43,194
Thank you.

1821
01:58:44,035 --> 01:58:46,311
Thank you for what you did for Emily.

1822
01:58:46,875 --> 01:58:48,354
It's my sacrifice, right?

1823
01:58:49,715 --> 01:58:50,864
Yes, sir.

1824
01:58:56,875 --> 01:58:57,910
Yep.

1825
01:58:58,075 --> 01:59:00,225
John, listen.

1826
01:59:00,435 --> 01:59:01,709
This isn't over yet.

1827
01:59:01,875 --> 01:59:03,468
<i>Walker had no prior contact...</i>

1828
01:59:03,635 --> 01:59:06,229
<i>...with any of the terrorists,
but someone else did.</i>

1829
01:59:06,395 --> 01:59:09,274
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

1830
01:59:09,435 --> 01:59:11,745
<i>- The president's with me.
- This guy, Stenz...</i>

1831
01:59:11,915 --> 01:59:14,145
<i>...made multiple calls
to a secure line in D. C...</i>

1832
01:59:14,315 --> 01:59:18,195
<i>...but we don't know who received them.
The database was wiped 30 minutes ago.</i>

1833
01:59:18,355 --> 01:59:20,551
<i>Really? Did you check Walker's
personal records?</i>

1834
01:59:20,715 --> 01:59:23,070
<i>His computer, his e-mails?</i>

1835
01:59:23,235 --> 01:59:25,351
<i>You don't know Walker, John.
He was a dinosaur.</i>

1836
01:59:25,515 --> 01:59:27,984
<i>The man still used a pager.</i>

1837
01:59:28,555 --> 01:59:29,954
Oh, shit.

1838
01:59:32,955 --> 01:59:35,595
Listen. Carol,
I got to check something out.

1839
01:59:35,755 --> 01:59:37,189
We'll see you outside.

1840
01:59:40,595 --> 01:59:42,074
I don't believe it.

1841
01:59:42,235 --> 01:59:47,025
I think I know how Walker got the codes,
but I'm gonna need your help, sir.

1842
01:59:53,355 --> 01:59:55,266
Move back! Move back.

1843
01:59:55,435 --> 01:59:56,584
Emily.

1844
01:59:58,595 --> 02:00:02,350
Oh, baby, you okay?
Oh, thank God.

1845
02:00:02,515 --> 02:00:04,108
Thank God, baby.

1846
02:00:10,995 --> 02:00:14,113
- Did you see my routine?
- Yeah.

1847
02:00:14,275 --> 02:00:19,111
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
You were beautiful, baby.

1848
02:00:19,275 --> 02:00:22,108
You saved us. You know that?

1849
02:00:24,435 --> 02:00:27,712
Hey, stay with Mommy for a second,
okay? I'll be right back.

1850
02:00:30,875 --> 02:00:33,549
- John.
- It's disarmed.

1851
02:00:33,715 --> 02:00:36,275
Thank God you're all right.
Where's the president?

1852
02:00:38,795 --> 02:00:39,990
He didn't make it, sir.

1853
02:00:46,195 --> 02:00:48,391
I need to address the nation.

1854
02:00:48,555 --> 02:00:50,831
General, get on with the Joint Chiefs.

1855
02:00:50,995 --> 02:00:54,465
We need to move our troops into
the Middle East to stabilise the region.

1856
02:00:54,675 --> 02:00:56,234
You wanna move troops in?

1857
02:00:56,395 --> 02:00:59,274
When they find out that we almost
launched a nuclear attack...

1858
02:00:59,475 --> 02:01:01,830
...there's gonna be chaos.
We have to contain it.

1859
02:01:01,995 --> 02:01:05,113
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course. Yeah.

1860
02:01:05,315 --> 02:01:07,545
When did you and Walker
cook this whole thing up?

1861
02:01:07,715 --> 02:01:08,830
- Excuse me?
- How'd it go?

1862
02:01:08,995 --> 02:01:11,669
You gave Walker the launch codes
and he made you president?

1863
02:01:13,035 --> 02:01:14,150
You can prove this?

1864
02:01:17,035 --> 02:01:20,027
Well, Walker had to get the launch codes
from somewhere...

1865
02:01:20,195 --> 02:01:22,471
...and you were the only person
with those codes.

1866
02:01:23,195 --> 02:01:25,186
And I found this pager
in Walker's pocket.

1867
02:01:25,355 --> 02:01:27,949
I only know one other person
that uses one of these.

1868
02:01:29,755 --> 02:01:31,587
That doesn't prove anything.

1869
02:01:31,795 --> 02:01:34,150
Two old guys use old technology.
So what?

1870
02:01:35,475 --> 02:01:38,991
Why don't you call the return number
on that, Carol?

1871
02:01:42,595 --> 02:01:45,394
Would have been better
if the evidence had been destroyed...

1872
02:01:45,555 --> 02:01:47,387
...in the air strike that you ordered.

1873
02:01:54,235 --> 02:01:55,794
You're a goddamn traitor, sir.

1874
02:01:58,875 --> 02:02:00,513
You dim little shit.

1875
02:02:00,675 --> 02:02:03,713
I hired you out of pity
and this is how you repay me.

1876
02:02:03,915 --> 02:02:06,987
Tomorrow, when people find out
that your precious president...

1877
02:02:07,155 --> 02:02:09,544
...helped a maniac
open the nuclear football...

1878
02:02:09,755 --> 02:02:12,395
...who do you think they're
going to believe, you or me?

1879
02:02:12,555 --> 02:02:14,705
You, you would be a nobody.

1880
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:17,913
But me, I'm the president
of the United States.

1881
02:02:18,075 --> 02:02:19,554
No, you're not.

1882
02:02:20,915 --> 02:02:22,906
Eli, Eli.

1883
02:02:23,075 --> 02:02:24,907
Quite the politician, huh?

1884
02:02:25,075 --> 02:02:28,830
You did all of this just to keep your
buddies in the defence industry happy.

1885
02:02:28,995 --> 02:02:30,872
How far did you fall into their pockets?

1886
02:02:31,035 --> 02:02:32,389
This is ridiculous.

1887
02:02:32,555 --> 02:02:35,229
- Take him into custody, general.
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

1888
02:02:35,395 --> 02:02:37,591
No, I'm still president.
I am still president.

1889
02:02:37,755 --> 02:02:40,827
Well, just consider this a coup d'état.
Get this trash off my lawn.

1890
02:02:41,035 --> 02:02:43,675
You're not fit for office.
You son of a bitch!

1891
02:02:43,835 --> 02:02:45,951
You're selling this country
out to the Arabs.

1892
02:02:46,115 --> 02:02:47,549
This isn't over. I got friends.

1893
02:02:47,715 --> 02:02:50,548
And I'll make sure all of your friends
meet you in prison.

1894
02:02:51,275 --> 02:02:52,913
Let's get him to the hospital.

1895
02:02:55,355 --> 02:02:58,268
You okay? You look terrible.

1896
02:02:59,315 --> 02:03:01,625
Thank you for everything
you did today.

1897
02:03:03,275 --> 02:03:04,629
Thank you for trusting me.

1898
02:03:04,795 --> 02:03:06,274
Special Agent Cale!

1899
02:03:06,475 --> 02:03:08,830
I'm not going anywhere
without my protection.

1900
02:03:12,075 --> 02:03:13,110
You heard him.

1901
02:03:26,795 --> 02:03:29,105
Thank you, sir. Hey, Em!

1902
02:03:30,675 --> 02:03:32,313
You wanna take a ride?

1903
02:03:33,835 --> 02:03:35,428
Come on.

1904
02:03:36,475 --> 02:03:37,749
- Can I go?
- Yeah, of course.

1905
02:03:37,915 --> 02:03:39,474
Go with your father.

1906
02:03:50,155 --> 02:03:51,873
She's an amazing girl.

1907
02:03:52,035 --> 02:03:54,834
This way! Move this way!

1908
02:03:56,355 --> 02:03:59,313
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

1909
02:03:59,475 --> 02:04:00,749
You sure you're all right?

1910
02:04:00,915 --> 02:04:02,633
I'm all right now.

1911
02:04:02,795 --> 02:04:05,150
Good job, special agent.

1912
02:04:05,315 --> 02:04:07,431
Thank you, general.

1913
02:04:18,715 --> 02:04:21,912
If you ever want a private tour
of the White House, just let me know.

1914
02:04:22,075 --> 02:04:24,794
I can hook it up like that.
I mean, maybe in a few weeks...

1915
02:04:24,955 --> 02:04:26,595
...when we've got
the place back together.

1916
02:04:26,675 --> 02:04:28,188
That's good to know.

1917
02:04:33,195 --> 02:04:34,868
You wanna give him the news?

1918
02:04:35,035 --> 02:04:38,312
Calls have been coming in
from all over the globe for the last hour.

1919
02:04:38,475 --> 02:04:43,072
The presidents of Iran, Russia, Israel
and France have all agreed to your terms.

1920
02:04:43,235 --> 02:04:45,385
It looks like your peace plan is a go.

1921
02:04:45,555 --> 02:04:48,673
You keep this up,
I just might have to vote for you.

1922
02:04:48,835 --> 02:04:50,906
You wanna see something
really special?

1923
02:04:51,075 --> 02:04:54,033
- Yeah.
- Carol.

1924
02:04:56,915 --> 02:04:59,907
Henry, the president
wants to do the thing.

1925
02:05:01,675 --> 02:05:02,745
Hold on tight.
