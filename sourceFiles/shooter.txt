1
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,586
Movement.

2
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:04,955
Two men.

3
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:07,999
Approximately

4
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,232
40 goats.

5
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:16,069
They're not on anybody's side.
We don't have to shoot them.

6
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,169
Egress?

7
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:23,745
Primary over the top, secondary
down the road, tertiary to the river.

8
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:28,245
No one can track you through the water
except a fish.

9
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,099
Sarah's headed off to nursing school
next month.

10
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:43,660
She sewed that herself.

11
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:45,131
It's beautiful.

12
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,571
You sure this is
a peacekeeping mission?

13
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:53,074
Normally there isn't any peace
to start with.

14
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:57,073
This shit's awful calm.

15
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:10,755
- Not at these coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:12,023
Go ahead and plot an alternate.

17
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,325
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,760
Command Post, Command Post,
this is TS-129, over.

19
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,498
Sir, I have visual confirmation
of TS-129's current position.

20
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:24,098
Mission accomplished, en route to
extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.

21
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,110
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

22
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:28,544
I have friendly forces moving
towards extraction point, over.

23
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:32,084
Heads up, our boys are coming through.

24
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,015
Viper, this is CP. Be advised,

25
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,487
possible hostile forces approaching
TS-129 at their 12:00.

26
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:38,783
Call them out.

27
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:40,225
Target.

28
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:42,721
Sector Bravo, deep.

29
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:45,092
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.

30
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:46,164
Range it.

31
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:52,465
870 yards and closing.

32
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:55,874
Wind, three-quarter value, push 2 left.

33
00:03:56,876 --> 00:04:00,073
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.

34
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:02,808
On target.

35
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:04,246
Hold scope.

36
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,681
Fire when ready.

37
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,312
Hit.

38
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:19,154
Command Post, this is Viper.
Hostile threat down, over.

39
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,665
Viper, this is Command Post.
We copy your traffic, over.

40
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:35,378
Call it in. It's time to go.

41
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:37,381
Command Post, this is Viper.
Mission accomplished.

42
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:38,507
- Packing up.
- Shit!

43
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,984
Viper, be advised larger hostile forces
approaching near sector Bravo.

44
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:44,419
Weren't supposed to be
hostiles that close!

45
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,830
Crooked tree.
675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.

46
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,867
Position to machine gun.
900, three-quarter value.

47
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:06,308
Fire when ready.

48
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:14,413
Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.

49
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,612
- I see it, Donnie. I see it.
- Fire when ready.

50
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:28,798
- They don't know where we are.
- But they might get lucky!

51
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:33,262
Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.

52
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:35,636
Enemy forces
have been stopped. Break.

53
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,471
Friendlies are continuing on
to extract point. Break.

54
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:42,479
We're receiving small arms and
indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.

55
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,650
Command Post, do you read me?

56
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:47,980
Shut it down.

57
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:49,221
They're highly-trained men,

58
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:52,085
eight kilometers inside a country
we are not supposed to be in.

59
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,523
I'm sure they'll get out just fine.
Shut it down now.

60
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:56,094
Radio check. Do you read me?

61
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:58,254
- Okay, wrap it up. Let's go!
- Do you read me?

62
00:05:58,364 --> 00:06:01,026
- Pull out those tracks.
- Pull out those tracks and pack it up!

63
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:15,004
Intelligence said
they didn't have air support!

64
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:16,240
Call it in!

65
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:22,386
Shit! The channel's down!

66
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:23,512
That's impossible!

67
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:25,021
The comm link's dead!

68
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:27,957
They left us here.
Don't worry, we're getting home!

69
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:10,795
Donnie?

70
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,633
Donnie!

71
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:44,695
Come on, boy!

72
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:47,727
Come on, Sam!

73
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,662
What're you doing, huh?
What're you doing?

74
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,794
Come on.

75
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:53,997
What? I got nothing.

76
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:55,173
What?

77
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,368
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.

78
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:02,112
That's a good boy.

79
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:16,784
Good boy.

80
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:25,401
Well, let's see what lies
they're trying to sell us today.

81
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,365
Here, boy.

82
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:33,006
Good boy.

83
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:47,051
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.

84
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,650
USMC, retired.

85
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:52,125
He is the best there is.

86
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,825
His last assignment went wrong.

87
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,232
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out
and left as expendable.

88
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:01,773
Opposing force sent an attack
helicopter and a hundred-man company.

89
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:04,707
His best friend and spotter was killed.

90
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,072
No official report.

91
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:10,410
Ghost report says he inflicted
70 percent casualties, the rest fled.

92
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:12,609
The agency asset
that left them there to die?

93
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:15,881
Suddenly removed from
the face of the earth two weeks after.

94
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:17,888
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.

95
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,753
He retired a week later.

96
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,952
I guess Bob Lee didn't think
he was expendable.

97
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:35,396
Grows and shoots his own food.

98
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:37,702
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

99
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,940
This is a man
with a history of duty and patriotism.

100
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,744
- Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs.
- Aye.

101
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:49,252
Some people don't know what to do
when their belief system collapses.

102
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:51,684
Bob Lee is one of those.

103
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,062
You sure, boy?

104
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:19,840
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

105
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:23,649
You guys turn around and go back
to wherever you came from.

106
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:26,923
Bob Lee Swagger?

107
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:29,050
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

108
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:30,723
You're a hard man to find.

109
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:32,091
But not hard enough.

110
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:33,721
Come a long way to see you.

111
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,034
We have some business
needs your attention.

112
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:37,692
You wanna use your low gear
going down the road

113
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:38,895
or your brakes'll go.

114
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:41,871
- Come here. Come here, boy.
- Don't do that.

115
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:46,374
Come near the porch I didn't invite you,
you'd have to shoot the dog.

116
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,969
That's a slow draw you got there.

117
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,514
Sure you want to do that?

118
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:52,439
Shoot a dog in this county
on a man's land,

119
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:54,883
I'd bury you in the hill,
and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

120
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:56,113
He understands.

121
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,147
Take your hand off your weapon.

122
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:00,384
Slowly.

123
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,628
So the gunnery sergeant
doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

124
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:07,593
I don't carry a gun.

125
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,096
You know what that is?

126
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:15,139
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.

127
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:17,231
They don't hand those out easy.

128
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,376
Yours?

129
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:20,076
Yeah.

130
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:22,169
Your father had one, didn't he?

131
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:23,805
What did you do?

132
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,647
Something foolhardy.
Kept some other boys alive.

133
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:29,516
Will you give me five minutes?

134
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,719
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

135
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,554
Come on, boy. Get in there.

136
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:42,195
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

137
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,325
Whose president?

138
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:44,459
Ours.

139
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:47,469
I didn't say "execute".

140
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,207
Plan.

141
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:52,067
So it can be stopped.

142
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:55,806
There's gonna be an attempt on the life
of the President in the next two weeks.

143
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:59,247
Code was broken
on an anonymous transmission.

144
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:02,916
It was internal.

145
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,387
We can't go to the usual agencies.

146
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,323
The government itself
has been penetrated.

147
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:13,888
The President has three
public engagements during that time.

148
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:18,493
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C.

149
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:21,436
Standard Secret Service
protective cordon

150
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,368
is out to 880 yards.

151
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:29,140
But this intercept claims that the shot
will be taken from beyond a mile.

152
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:32,239
We need you to scout,
tell us how you would do it,

153
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:34,107
so we could stop it.

154
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:39,615
I'm not entirely convinced
that a shot like this could be made.

155
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:43,121
But let's not take the chance.

156
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:46,558
Your longer shots
were never confirmed.

157
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,565
That's because long shots
generally go places

158
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:51,500
you wouldn't wanna have
to go afterwards to confirm them.

159
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:54,197
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.

160
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,304
You know what it takes
to make a shot at that range?

161
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,933
Everything comes into play that far.

162
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:02,138
Humidity, elevation, temperature,
wind, spindrift.

163
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:03,578
There's a 6 to 10 second flight time

164
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:05,775
so you have to shoot
at where the target's going to be.

165
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:08,978
Even the Coriolis effect,
the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

166
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,317
President'll be wearing body amour.
That means a headshot,

167
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:12,583
at over a mile.

168
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:14,955
You believe there's a shooter involved
capable of making this shot?

169
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,288
Yes.

170
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:18,761
Well, then you got a real problem.
You need to find the shooter.

171
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:21,233
That's being worked on
from another direction.

172
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:23,094
We need you to do this.

173
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:25,169
Don't really like the President much.

174
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,170
Didn't like the one before
that much, either.

175
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:29,137
You like the idea of the President?

176
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:30,975
Living in a free country?

177
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,510
Do we allow America
to be ruled by thugs?

178
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,375
Sure, some years we do.

179
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:39,482
I believe you stood before a flag

180
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:41,247
and solemnly swore

181
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:46,022
that you'd support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

182
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,785
against all enemies,

183
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,520
foreign and domestic.

184
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,562
I think your five minutes is up.

185
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,563
Listen to me, son.

186
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:06,770
I don't want you to turn on the TV
next week

187
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:10,277
and see the President dead,

188
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:13,044
and know you could've done
something about it.

189
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:15,910
Don't do that to yourself.

190
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,505
Is that the new one?

191
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,872
The truck.

192
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,846
You got the big engine in there?

193
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:46,509
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.

194
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:50,315
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother
to give you the gas mileage for it.

195
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:51,980
You mind if I take a picture?

196
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,316
This is beautiful.

197
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:02,561
Someone will be at this number
night or day.

198
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:10,367
You see what he did?
He didn't need a photo of the engine.

199
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:12,773
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass
about the engine.

200
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:14,402
He's trained in counterintel.

201
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,845
Backed up far enough
to take a picture of the plates.

202
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:18,438
This is our guy.

203
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,949
I thought he turned you down.

204
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,485
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

205
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:39,422
1,760's a mile.

206
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:43,893
It's a far piece, Sam.
Think the President ought to worry?

207
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,326
Yeah, I think he better worry.

208
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,812
Yeah, he'll be fine.

209
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:38,945
Just feed him once a day. Read him
a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.

210
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,319
Yep. I'm out.

211
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,560
Come here, buddy.

212
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:45,489
Okay.

213
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:49,655
Think you'll be able to tough it out
without me for a couple days?

214
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:51,469
Yeah.

215
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,783
This is Command Post.
What's your status? Over.

216
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:22,723
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

217
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:25,625
Roger that. We copy.
Checkpoint down, over.

218
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,377
Before you stands Independence Hall,
the birthplace of the United States

219
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:46,382
and one of the most important buildings
in American history.

220
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:48,616
Built in 1732...

221
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,847
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

222
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:53,253
both the Declaration of Independence
and the U.S. Constitution

223
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:55,519
were debated and signed here.

224
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:05,091
Out of the three cities,

225
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:08,138
there's only one with
a reasonably high chance of success.

226
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:10,035
There was no room in Baltimore.

227
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:11,574
Street isn't wide enough to correct
for the windage,

228
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:13,439
buildings are in the way.

229
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:15,069
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

230
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,278
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

231
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,305
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

232
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:18,439
waiting for him in the afterlife,

233
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,074
I'd rule that out.

234
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:21,311
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

235
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,020
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.

236
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:25,589
It's one of six possible locations,

237
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,625
approximately five stories
above the President's location.

238
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:31,855
Flight time of the bullet that distance
is five to six seconds.

239
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:33,191
They'll have to wait
till he takes the podium,

240
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:34,822
several lines into his speech.

241
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,731
That way he'd be completely static,
obviously at his most exposed.

242
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,770
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.

243
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:42,635
Expect the bullet to be handmade,
bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.

244
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,037
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,

245
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:45,166
touch more slippery.

246
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:46,766
Least that's what I'd do.

247
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:49,210
You can kill him from that far away?

248
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:53,184
Mile and a half, the bullet's
going to strike with more energy

249
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:54,478
than a .44 Magnum point blank.

250
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:56,281
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

251
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:58,150
The challenge is the wind.

252
00:21:58,256 --> 00:22:00,121
Lightest breeze uncorrected
at that distance

253
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:01,522
is enough to ruin the shot.

254
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:04,823
He's gonna need indicators between
the podium and the shooting position.

255
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,419
Velocity corrections are easy,

256
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:08,328
but an angle change,
that becomes a trig problem.

257
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,401
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.

258
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:13,471
Without something to gauge, your shot's
just too tough to make cold bore.

259
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:16,631
Impressive recon and report, son.

260
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:18,766
Move too soon, we lose him.

261
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:20,174
We want to take him alive.

262
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:23,804
If we don't know who hired him,
it could just happen again.

263
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:29,382
We'll have six
three-man teams standing by.

264
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:32,080
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

265
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,316
A moment?

266
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:37,961
You've done your country
a great service, son.

267
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:39,051
- On the day...
- Look...

268
00:22:39,163 --> 00:22:40,221
Listen.

269
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,632
You're one of the few people
who knows what to look for.

270
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:47,468
I could use a spotter.

271
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:56,273
Thank you, Philadelphia.

272
00:23:56,374 --> 00:23:58,467
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

273
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:00,203
Before you on this stage...

274
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:02,973
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

275
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:06,175
Patriots met in Independence Hall
and created a document,

276
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:08,047
the Declaration of Independence...

277
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:09,278
Sir?

278
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:11,014
And a country,
the United States of America,

279
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:12,555
that changed the world.

280
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:14,989
Philadelphia is our home. We are...

281
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:16,890
Stand by, all teams.
This is Listening Post.

282
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:19,759
Flashlight's current location
is approaching Checkpoint Jason.

283
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:23,356
All sniper teams
send update on your sitrep.

284
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:26,862
- Stand by.
- Yes, I have a clear line of sight.

285
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:35,235
Copy that.

286
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:37,712
Post 18 clear, over.

287
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:40,443
Post 19, please report.
What's your status?

288
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:43,880
All clear.
There's really nothing going on here.

289
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:46,423
The Archbishop of Ethiopia...

290
00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:49,015
The President will be awarding
the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal

291
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,789
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo,
the Archbishop of Ethiopia.

292
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,456
There's been some controversy
surrounding the Archbishop

293
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:57,728
as he's been speaking out
regarding the atrocities in his country.

294
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:00,201
He plans to meet with the President
right after the ceremony

295
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:01,635
to discuss these matters.

296
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:04,037
These are great times.

297
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:07,273
These are historic times.

298
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:10,677
And these are troubled times, as well.

299
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:14,816
This medal that your country...

300
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:16,147
Yellow ribbons.

301
00:25:16,254 --> 00:25:18,814
Yeah, people put those up
to remember the troops.

302
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:21,153
No, they tie those low around trees.

303
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:23,426
These are windage flags.

304
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:25,094
Roughly the location
I'd have put them in

305
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:26,686
for a shot from the steeple.

306
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:29,061
Yeah. Maybe.

307
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,226
No, definitely.
He knows what he's doing.

308
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:33,269
You guys got a team in place
to take out the church?

309
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:36,204
They'll move right before the shot
is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

310
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:39,970
Raises its head and confronts freedom,

311
00:25:40,078 --> 00:25:45,414
but slyly, subtly,
chokes it off at the root.

312
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:49,213
And it is our responsibility

313
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,550
to find these dark weeds.

314
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:56,319
Flashlight has arrived.
I say again, Flashlight has arrived.

315
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:00,392
- If you just joined us...
- Hi.

316
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:03,126
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

317
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:05,732
Bob Lee Swagger.

318
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:10,600
It is a real honor to meet you.

319
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,403
You're unsnapped, officer.

320
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,869
Shit. Oh, fuck.

321
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,244
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

322
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:20,840
Again, it's an honor.

323
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:28,818
Of our stewardship of this great...

324
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:32,453
- That our guy in the collar?
- The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

325
00:26:32,563 --> 00:26:34,827
He's getting a medal. Know it?

326
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:37,025
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

327
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:39,103
You know I worked there?

328
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:41,000
You know what they say
about the first thing that you feel

329
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:43,039
when you shoot a civilian, right?

330
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:45,439
- Recoil of your rifle?
- Right.

331
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:47,010
That's very original.

332
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:50,380
Thank you, Archbishop,
for those inspiring words.

333
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:52,972
The President speaks next.

334
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:54,346
All teams stand by.

335
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,779
Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by.
Situation all clear, over.

336
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:01,551
Agent James, all clear.

337
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:03,684
Now it gives me enormous pleasure...

338
00:27:03,795 --> 00:27:05,729
- Got wind at three, full value.
- ...to introduce to you

339
00:27:05,863 --> 00:27:07,797
the President of the United States.

340
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:09,992
Make it four-and-a-half minutes
of angle.

341
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:12,961
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

342
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:38,222
He's loaded.

343
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:42,265
Altitude, humidity,
temperature accounted for.

344
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:45,968
In the city that was the capital of...

345
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,537
We got to take him.

346
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,105
Ten seconds.

347
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:51,869
Wind matches his setup.
Take him! Take him now!

348
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,375
Send in the ERT team. Take out the...

349
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,470
Shots fired! Shots fired!

350
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,060
Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.

351
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,259
- What? Flashlight down?
- I say again. Flashlight is down.

352
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:20,394
- The President has been shot.
- There's mass confusion...

353
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,639
Has the President been shot?

354
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:26,503
Right at the church steeple.

355
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:31,307
How could you miss?

356
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:33,878
How could you fucking miss?

357
00:28:33,985 --> 00:28:37,148
Thirty seconds, clear out.
Chase him down.

358
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:38,847
He's bleeding. Kill him.

359
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:42,888
Command Post to Condor Two,
load up, over.

360
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:44,461
Condor Two loading up.

361
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:49,123
Go, go, go, go, go!

362
00:28:55,506 --> 00:28:57,406
Hurry up, guys. Come on.

363
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,221
Condor Two, this is Command Post.
Stand by for update, over.

364
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:13,688
Standing by, over.

365
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:16,756
Command Post!

366
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,191
Command Post!
Command Post, this is Post 19.

367
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:21,322
You guys read me?

368
00:29:21,432 --> 00:29:22,490
- Should I hold post?
- Please.

369
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,864
Please help me. Please. They shot me.

370
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:27,233
- FBI. Put your hands up!
- Please. Hey.

371
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:30,440
Save me.

372
00:29:31,575 --> 00:29:32,542
What?

373
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:42,116
Give me the keys.

374
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:44,881
I didn't shoot the President.
Timmons was a setup.

375
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,616
Help!

376
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,458
FBI! Took my weapon and my car.

377
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,062
Don't worry, I already shot him twice.
You all right?

378
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,004
CP, 17, can you repeat
possible suspect description?

379
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:05,132
Negative, no further at this time.

380
00:30:05,242 --> 00:30:07,767
CP, this is 15.
No activity at my location.

381
00:30:07,878 --> 00:30:09,937
I am available to move if necessary.

382
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:11,378
Copy that.

383
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:17,516
This is Officer Timmons
requesting backup.

384
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,555
Pursuing suspect in assassination.

385
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:23,787
Now fleeing in stolen FBI vehicle,
moving south on Front from Diamond.

386
00:30:23,928 --> 00:30:25,520
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
I repeat,

387
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:27,755
suspect is armed and dangerous.

388
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:30,231
All Philly PD units be advised,

389
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:33,235
assassination suspect is fleeing
in a stolen FBI vehicle.

390
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:36,033
He is going south
on Front from Diamond.

391
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,109
This is Condor 2. We are transitioning
from roadhouse to Front Street.

392
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,405
Please advise for further description
of suspect vehicle.

393
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:44,811
Dispatch, 419,
I'm heading south on Thompson.

394
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:46,974
Do we have a color,
anything on the vehicle?

395
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:55,251
Assassination suspect's vehicle

396
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,193
is one government-issue
black 2006 Ford Crown Vic.

397
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:04,962
Pennsylvania license number
7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.

398
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:08,196
What was suspect's
last known location? Over.

399
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:10,500
Last known is south on Front.

400
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:20,341
This is Agent James. Do we have
multiple suspects or a single suspect?

401
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:24,948
Agent James, negative.
No further information...

402
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:28,685
This is Agent Pittman.
Car seen going high speed on Castor.

403
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,852
High speed on Castor. Be advised.

404
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:38,829
Timmons called it in?

405
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:41,166
Right on time, like he was supposed to.

406
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:43,001
- Before he shot him again.
- Yeah, well, he's been hit twice,

407
00:31:43,107 --> 00:31:45,837
so unless he can stop the bleeding
without going to the hospital or a doctor,

408
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:47,069
it doesn't really matter.

409
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:51,137
They're going to find him lying dead
by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.

410
00:31:51,315 --> 00:31:52,282
What is your location?

411
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:06,725
Suspect vehicle a black sedan,
four-door...

412
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,704
All units be advised,

413
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:27,250
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle
entering High-Tech Car Wash

414
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:30,184
on the northwest corner
of Girard and 9th, over.

415
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:31,254
Command Post be advised,

416
00:32:31,355 --> 00:32:33,789
this is Condor Two en route
to suspect location, over.

417
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:36,382
Command Post, Condor Three copies.
All en route.

418
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:42,860
- Yo, man!
- Watch it, man!

419
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:04,245
Shit!

420
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:23,898
Command Post, Condors Two
and Three moving to intercept, over.

421
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:59,267
Suspect vehicle collided with a truck
under the 95.

422
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:01,173
He's at Market and Columbus.

423
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,513
Looks good. Vehicle is disabled.
Repeat, vehicle disabled.

424
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:18,519
Take him down! Fire!

425
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,886
I got a Crown Vic. Black.
Government plates.

426
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:49,084
Dead guy in the front seat?

427
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:56,692
I want the banks of this river lined
for 30 miles, five minutes ago.

428
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,868
All right.
Let's start the search downriver.

429
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:23,218
I'm here with Officer Timmons,
who pursued the suspect on foot.

430
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,892
Officer, can you tell us what happened?

431
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:09,031
The would-be assassin,
tentatively identified

432
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:12,625
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Bob Lee Swagger,

433
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:17,298
is being pursued by thousands of State
and Federal law enforcement personnel

434
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:18,602
as we speak.

435
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:22,440
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

436
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:24,844
Nothing but an abandoned car
has been found

437
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:26,813
at the bottom of the Delaware River.

438
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:30,546
Seven-year veteran Philadelphia
police officer Stanley Timmons,

439
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:32,144
first to respond to the scene,

440
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:35,248
is believed to have shot
and injured Swagger.

441
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,520
Early reports indicate that the assailant

442
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:40,620
may have been hit
as many as two times.

443
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:43,461
Meanwhile, the FBI has been
unwilling to comment

444
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,865
on information that an agent of theirs

445
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:50,099
was assaulted and disarmed
by Swagger as he fled the scene,

446
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,675
possibly in a stolen FBI vehicle.

447
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:56,303
At this time, no sign of Swagger
has been found.

448
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:58,472
You have embarrassed this office.

449
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:02,985
You will be facing a review from the
Office of Professional Responsibility.

450
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:04,075
Sir...

451
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:07,386
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.

452
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:09,425
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper

453
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:12,427
disarmed me three weeks
out of the academy.

454
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:15,692
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.

455
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,640
Why'd he say
he didn't shoot the President?

456
00:38:25,742 --> 00:38:27,107
Because he didn't.

457
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:33,848
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.

458
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:35,282
He never said that.

459
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:37,512
City cop managed to spot,
shoot this guy twice.

460
00:38:37,621 --> 00:38:39,111
You got your ass kicked.

461
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:40,622
You're misremembering.

462
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,456
That's normal
under extreme stress events.

463
00:38:44,461 --> 00:38:46,361
Have you given
your official statement yet?

464
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:49,455
Because I would be very cautious
about what went in it.

465
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:53,730
Well, maybe I should wait for the report
to come out, read it and then remember.

466
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:56,005
Can you believe this fucking guy?

467
00:38:58,442 --> 00:38:59,602
There you go.

468
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:01,466
- Yes?
- The raw feeds are in

469
00:39:01,578 --> 00:39:02,476
from the networks.

470
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:24,426
Development, security camera footage
from Washington, D.C.

471
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:26,503
And several locations in Philadelphia

472
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:29,834
shows the suspect,
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,

473
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,899
scouting shooting locations,
traveling and taking wind readings.

474
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:38,878
As the net begins to tighten nationwide,
there is still no trace of Swagger.

475
00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:09,672
Excuse me.

476
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,874
Can't sell you nothing.
Just lost our power.

477
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:15,213
Please. I got cash,
and you can keep the change.

478
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:17,048
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

479
00:40:17,154 --> 00:40:19,622
Please, all I need is a marinade needle,
some salt, some sugar,

480
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:21,190
couple bottles of water.

481
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,114
How many?

482
00:41:09,172 --> 00:41:12,198
Well, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

483
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:14,800
I'm sure she's
a really nice Christian woman

484
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:17,744
but we don't take care
of those things here.

485
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:19,907
- Yeah. Okay, well...
- The FBI released a video letter...

486
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:22,042
- ...see a counselor.
- ...threatening the life of the President...

487
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:23,176
Dr. Phil or something. Okay.

488
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:25,550
Signed and dated
by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.

489
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:28,250
Federal agents today
executed a search warrant

490
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:30,553
in the Wind River range of Wyoming

491
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:33,562
where Swagger had been living
for several years.

492
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:37,065
In the meantime, the FBI
has been unwilling to comment,

493
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,499
as no sign of Swagger has been found.

494
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:42,801
- Get anything?
- No.

495
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:46,263
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

496
00:42:58,782 --> 00:42:59,806
And? Yes?

497
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:03,079
She thinks it was him, but it was dark
because the power was out in the store.

498
00:43:03,186 --> 00:43:04,517
- What'd he buy?
- Gotta be.

499
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:07,613
Salt, sugar, water,
and a marinade injector.

500
00:43:07,724 --> 00:43:09,089
Guy going to a barbecue.

501
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:11,786
Salt, water, an injector could be used
for an IV,

502
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:12,952
but what's with the sugar?

503
00:43:13,063 --> 00:43:14,325
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold that! Hold that!

504
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:16,023
Well, sugar's been used to treat
battlefield wounds

505
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,100
for hundreds of years.

506
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,430
It has something to do
with osmotic pressure.

507
00:43:19,536 --> 00:43:21,970
It was popular
during the Napoleonic War.

508
00:43:22,072 --> 00:43:24,540
You go into Howard's office
with the Napoleonic War,

509
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:25,835
he's gonna put you on psych leave.

510
00:43:25,942 --> 00:43:28,172
Go back to your desk.
I'm saving your life.

511
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:51,100
One thing is...

512
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,067
1790 to 1800.

513
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,377
One thing is...

514
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:18,981
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

515
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:20,522
I know who you are.

516
00:45:20,624 --> 00:45:23,491
You're Bob Lee. Swagger.
Donnie's old partner.

517
00:45:23,593 --> 00:45:26,221
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

518
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:27,421
I know.

519
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,519
You do?

520
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:32,159
The President's not dead.
Ethiopian Archbishop is.

521
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:36,764
Why in the hell
would somebody want to shoot him?

522
00:45:37,507 --> 00:45:38,633
Look, you're a nurse, right?

523
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:43,338
No. No, that was Donnie's dream.
I couldn't stand the blood.

524
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:44,640
I teach the third grade.

525
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:46,940
- Please.
- Look, you should go.

526
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,142
Please.

527
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:49,409
Please?

528
00:45:49,753 --> 00:45:51,744
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

529
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:53,322
I swear.

530
00:45:53,823 --> 00:45:56,053
I'm in some bad trouble
and I need some help.

531
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:58,684
I wouldn't have come all the way here
to lie to you.

532
00:46:02,165 --> 00:46:04,861
You still figuring on shooting me?

533
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:07,766
Only that shotgun's a little long
to bring up fast.

534
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,999
Look, if you're going to do it,
just get it over with.

535
00:46:11,107 --> 00:46:13,075
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

536
00:46:16,313 --> 00:46:20,044
Pull the truck in the garage.
The neighbors'll be up in a minute.

537
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,674
You'd best call me Sarah.

538
00:46:21,785 --> 00:46:22,979
All right.

539
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:40,462
911, what's your emergency?

540
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:10,189
Hello?

541
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,131
This is 911. We received a hang-up
from this location.

542
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:14,760
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over
the trash cans

543
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:17,362
and scared the hell out of me.
Everything's fine. Thanks.

544
00:47:17,474 --> 00:47:18,441
Okay, then.

545
00:47:24,547 --> 00:47:27,710
Seems you call the police and hang up
without saying anything,

546
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:29,876
they call you back right away.

547
00:47:36,126 --> 00:47:38,492
I should've come
and seen you in person.

548
00:47:41,564 --> 00:47:43,896
Before. I mean, then.

549
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,365
Yeah, I read the letter.

550
00:47:47,437 --> 00:47:48,734
It was okay.

551
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:53,002
And once a year I got the flowers.

552
00:47:55,545 --> 00:47:57,035
You don't look real good.

553
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:02,349
I'm supposed to be dead.
Been a long night.

554
00:48:02,452 --> 00:48:04,420
Why aren't you?

555
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:06,887
Well, the U.S. government spent
a lot of time and money

556
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,787
teaching me how not to die

557
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:11,383
after they got done teaching me
how to kill people.

558
00:48:12,762 --> 00:48:15,094
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

559
00:48:16,366 --> 00:48:20,564
You can do a running cross-stitch,
finish it with an embroidery knot?

560
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,637
Yeah.

561
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:33,572
You got to try to spread it out.

562
00:48:33,683 --> 00:48:36,049
It's gonna look odd
you buy it all in one place.

563
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:47,279
How can it be three years ago
when it seems like ten?

564
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:52,813
Mileage can be rough.

565
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:05,962
No one ever beats me in.

566
00:49:13,342 --> 00:49:14,604
You never left.

567
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,637
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

568
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,874
Like I didn't see what I saw,
or heard what I heard.

569
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,418
I'm not crazy, though.
You think I'm crazy?

570
00:49:25,787 --> 00:49:27,914
Where did all this stuff come from?

571
00:49:28,657 --> 00:49:31,717
At first I thought
it was Washington, Quantico.

572
00:49:31,827 --> 00:49:35,729
I checked and it didn't.
It just magically arrived.

573
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:40,234
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO,
places that don't even have initials

574
00:49:40,335 --> 00:49:43,133
they cooperate
in times of national emergency.

575
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:44,865
You need to get some sleep.

576
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:47,737
You know that the first
ballistics diagram got here

577
00:49:47,843 --> 00:49:49,674
22 minutes after the shooting.

578
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,802
We're good at our jobs.

579
00:49:50,912 --> 00:49:53,380
12 minutes after the shooting,
they were still scrambling choppers.

580
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:54,608
The scene was locked down.

581
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,216
How did they get a reverse azimuth
10 minutes after that?

582
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:00,413
I mean, we work
for the federal government.

583
00:50:00,522 --> 00:50:01,853
We're not that good at our jobs.

584
00:50:02,724 --> 00:50:04,316
- You want to see something?
- Probably not.

585
00:50:04,426 --> 00:50:05,791
I downloaded this.

586
00:50:05,894 --> 00:50:07,020
This is a full-scale printout

587
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,121
of a target Swagger shot
two years ago at 1,000 yards.

588
00:50:10,232 --> 00:50:13,497
I punched in the holes myself.
It was at a competition.

589
00:50:13,602 --> 00:50:18,335
I read an article. It said Swagger shot
a silver dollar at a grand.

590
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,634
Five shots,

591
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,203
at 1,000 yards,

592
00:50:21,443 --> 00:50:23,707
an inch-and-a-half spread.
An inch and a half!

593
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:27,571
It was the capital of the United States...

594
00:50:27,683 --> 00:50:31,210
That's the flag behind the President.
It's barely waving.

595
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,752
This is the wind speed and direction

596
00:50:32,854 --> 00:50:34,116
according to the
National Weather Service

597
00:50:34,222 --> 00:50:36,520
at the time of the shot. I did the math.

598
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,253
Now, how does a man who can do that

599
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:43,326
miss by two-and-a-half feet
at 2,000 yards?

600
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,125
I don't get it.

601
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:48,066
You've had a long night.
Let it go and get some sleep.

602
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,297
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

603
00:50:50,405 --> 00:50:52,635
He said he was walking foot patrol,

604
00:50:52,741 --> 00:50:55,335
saw a rifle barrel
sticking out of a window,

605
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:58,277
went upstairs to investigate,
and shot Swagger.

606
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,280
No sniper sticks his rifle
out of a window.

607
00:51:00,382 --> 00:51:03,146
They shoot from cover,
back in the room.

608
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,452
It doesn't make any sense.

609
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,350
- I'm gonna talk to Timmons.
- No, you're not.

610
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:11,551
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me
if I do?

611
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:15,157
Timmons was killed by a mugger
in an alley last night.

612
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:21,326
In a conspiracy,
all loose ends are trimmed.

613
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,835
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

614
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:25,930
Bad things happen to good people.

615
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,065
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

616
00:51:33,115 --> 00:51:35,515
Well, I stopped the bleeding
temporarily.

617
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:38,681
But it'll cut loose again.

618
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:42,086
I held off the worst of the infection,
but you're gonna have to open it up,

619
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,988
cut out and scrub away
anything that's dead,

620
00:51:45,093 --> 00:51:47,960
working your way out,
sewing it together

621
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,861
and you got to try to make sure
you don't re-infect it.

622
00:51:53,301 --> 00:51:54,734
You ready for this?

623
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,768
I'm going to do all those Whip-It!'s
and pass out.

624
00:52:02,944 --> 00:52:04,275
Good luck, okay?

625
00:53:18,253 --> 00:53:21,654
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

626
00:53:21,756 --> 00:53:23,189
That our guy in the collar?

627
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:24,519
Whose president?

628
00:53:24,626 --> 00:53:26,025
I didn't say 'execute'.

629
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:29,028
He's getting a medal. Know it?

630
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,360
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

631
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,260
You need to find the shooter.

632
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:41,576
No.

633
00:55:34,923 --> 00:55:37,551
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice,
no sign?

634
00:55:37,659 --> 00:55:39,058
Find me something.

635
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,321
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

636
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:44,191
He's not dead.

637
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:47,433
Tear apart his life.

638
00:55:47,535 --> 00:55:48,866
Again.

639
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:55,133
Go okay?

640
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,847
I've been hallucinating.

641
00:56:04,853 --> 00:56:06,787
Something I need to tell you.

642
00:56:10,025 --> 00:56:11,856
Ralphie's dead.

643
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,188
Who's Ralphie?

644
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:15,762
Well, they said you shot your dog

645
00:56:15,864 --> 00:56:17,764
'cause you knew
you weren't coming back.

646
00:56:17,866 --> 00:56:19,333
They said that, huh?

647
00:56:23,738 --> 00:56:25,171
Name was Sam.

648
00:56:26,274 --> 00:56:28,742
He was a good dog.
I raised him from a pup.

649
00:56:32,814 --> 00:56:34,008
You okay?

650
00:56:35,984 --> 00:56:36,951
No.

651
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:39,814
What are you gonna do?

652
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:42,950
I'll get better.

653
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:47,317
Then I'm going to burn
their playhouse down.

654
00:57:23,198 --> 00:57:24,290
Can I help you?

655
00:57:53,294 --> 00:57:54,420
Hold still.

656
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,905
I been meaning to ask you.

657
00:58:08,643 --> 00:58:10,304
You have a boyfriend?

658
00:58:12,347 --> 00:58:13,371
Why?

659
00:58:14,582 --> 00:58:17,176
Am I still supposed to be
the grieving widow?

660
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,946
It's been three years.

661
00:58:19,053 --> 00:58:20,020
No.

662
00:58:20,588 --> 00:58:22,021
Just wonder if I'm gonna have
to shoot somebody

663
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,283
walks through that door
without knocking,

664
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:25,325
wondering where you've been.

665
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:29,187
Well, no.

666
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,527
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

667
00:58:56,024 --> 00:58:57,321
Not bad.

668
00:58:58,593 --> 00:59:00,254
A little stiff, but...

669
00:59:02,063 --> 00:59:03,030
Hey.

670
00:59:04,265 --> 00:59:06,961
You know, you would've made
one hell of a nurse.

671
00:59:08,203 --> 00:59:10,068
That was really brave, what you did.

672
00:59:10,438 --> 00:59:11,598
You saved my life.

673
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:18,305
I'm better. I better get to it.

674
00:59:18,413 --> 00:59:20,745
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

675
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:22,941
Never.

676
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:26,380
They're never gonna stop looking.

677
00:59:28,256 --> 00:59:31,521
In the meantime,
they need someone else to find.

678
00:59:31,626 --> 00:59:33,116
I'm going to give them him.

679
00:59:33,228 --> 00:59:34,695
Excuse me?

680
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,957
May be a way to get two birds
with that stone, too.

681
00:59:47,475 --> 00:59:49,340
- Swagger?
- Hey.

682
00:59:59,153 --> 01:00:01,883
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with
when he was a kid.

683
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:07,061
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

684
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:09,595
I cleaned and oiled it
before I put it away.

685
01:00:09,697 --> 01:00:10,755
You sure?

686
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,967
Yeah.

687
01:00:17,305 --> 01:00:18,670
Why'd you go?

688
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,203
When they came to see you.

689
01:00:23,611 --> 01:00:25,772
They know which buttons to press.

690
01:00:26,614 --> 01:00:28,673
I'm still enough of a sucker,
you press that patriot button,

691
01:00:28,783 --> 01:00:32,378
I'll sit up in my chair and say,
"Which way you want me to go, boss?"

692
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:36,116
I mean, I ain't real proud of it,
but I ain't ashamed, either.

693
01:00:37,492 --> 01:00:38,857
You know, I got a plan,

694
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:42,559
but I think I'm going to need your help.

695
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,664
Okay. I'll do it.

696
01:00:45,366 --> 01:00:47,698
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

697
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,395
I know.

698
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,370
Look.

699
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:00,682
It was my fault.

700
01:01:03,484 --> 01:01:04,451
What?

701
01:01:08,022 --> 01:01:10,183
You know, with Donnie.
I should never have...

702
01:01:17,265 --> 01:01:18,254
What?

703
01:01:23,438 --> 01:01:25,065
Don't you dare.

704
01:01:27,108 --> 01:01:30,168
Don't you try and take that
away from him.

705
01:01:31,212 --> 01:01:34,943
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enlisted.

706
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:36,141
He knew exactly what he was doing

707
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,014
when he enrolled
in scout sniper training.

708
01:01:40,755 --> 01:01:42,689
He loved what he did.

709
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:44,758
No one made him do it.

710
01:01:47,195 --> 01:01:49,322
That ain't yours to carry.

711
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,861
You're right.

712
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,903
I'm sorry I tried.

713
01:02:22,797 --> 01:02:24,059
It's okay.

714
01:02:30,071 --> 01:02:32,335
I need you to meet with this FBI agent.

715
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,204
Use him to flush Johnson
out of his hiding place.

716
01:02:35,309 --> 01:02:39,302
Give him the vehicle ID number.
He'll do what he's trained to do.

717
01:02:39,414 --> 01:02:41,882
You get in and get out.
Don't get caught.

718
01:02:42,183 --> 01:02:43,775
You get caught, I get caught.

719
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,443
You know what that is?

720
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,951
Says he didn't shoot no one,
but I don't know.

721
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,354
Well, he's been staying with me.

722
01:02:51,459 --> 01:02:53,518
Who's been staying with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

723
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:06,229
The plates are probably fake.
Pretty sure the other number's real.

724
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,932
- And what is this?
- A VIN number.

725
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:11,273
Seems no one goes through
the trouble to change them anymore.

726
01:03:12,513 --> 01:03:15,414
And you're going to sit real still
until I'm long gone.

727
01:03:47,048 --> 01:03:48,242
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

728
01:04:13,941 --> 01:04:15,841
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID, please?

729
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:25,416
Sir, I'm going to need you
to take off your hat

730
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,680
and show me some ID.

731
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:32,383
I'm not gonna ask you again.

732
01:04:33,794 --> 01:04:35,557
Take your hat off, asshole!

733
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,505
Get on the ground!
Get your ass on the ground!

734
01:05:20,841 --> 01:05:22,069
Hey, how's it going?

735
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,072
Hey, John.

736
01:05:48,603 --> 01:05:49,797
- Hey, Ed?
- Yeah.

737
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,838
You got that Stevens file
we wanted back?

738
01:05:54,308 --> 01:05:57,471
How badly do you want to know?
Because this will get you fired.

739
01:05:57,812 --> 01:06:03,512
Well, I have to go before
the Office of Professional Responsibility

740
01:06:03,618 --> 01:06:05,609
in 45 minutes for a review.

741
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,746
I'm gonna get fired anyway.
I'm done worrying about that.

742
01:06:09,957 --> 01:06:11,925
What do you think?

743
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:15,061
I think that CNN got the tapes
before we did,

744
01:06:15,162 --> 01:06:17,494
already edited together
to show the angles.

745
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:18,690
Who delivered them?

746
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:22,200
An unnamed agency
who will never confirm or deny.

747
01:06:22,303 --> 01:06:24,271
They denied, which is a...

748
01:06:26,874 --> 01:06:30,037
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

749
01:06:30,144 --> 01:06:31,975
Of what?

750
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,606
That you are asking questions
way outside your pay grade.

751
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:36,842
Oh, come on, just tell me.

752
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,441
You don't want to be here
for that review.

753
01:06:38,552 --> 01:06:42,113
They don't have to stop at firing you.
They can charge you and hold you.

754
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:54,696
The ASAC's job
comes with Delta clearance.

755
01:06:57,738 --> 01:06:59,035
- Thank you.
- Go.

756
01:07:06,213 --> 01:07:08,204
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

757
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,409
These guys talk about everything.
I didn't give it much thought at the time.

758
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:13,987
We just traced it to a donut shop
with free WiFi.

759
01:07:14,088 --> 01:07:16,852
But this,
this is a Delta-level clearance request

760
01:07:16,957 --> 01:07:19,755
out of the FBI field office in Philadelphia
seven minutes ago.

761
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,454
Funny thing,
Google Maps puts the donut shop

762
01:07:22,563 --> 01:07:25,088
only three blocks away
from the field office.

763
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:28,259
There's only one guy who met
with Swagger before he disappeared.

764
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:29,563
He lives in Philly.

765
01:07:29,804 --> 01:07:31,237
And he works for the FBI.

766
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,871
Nicholas Memphis.

767
01:07:34,308 --> 01:07:37,766
Really strange company.
Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

768
01:07:37,878 --> 01:07:40,711
Offices in Virginia, Delaware,
registered in Panama.

769
01:07:40,815 --> 01:07:42,612
They own a boat
that's flagged out of Libya.

770
01:07:42,717 --> 01:07:43,706
They're definitely not government,

771
01:07:43,818 --> 01:07:46,548
but they have high ex-military contacts
like you wouldn't believe.

772
01:07:46,654 --> 01:07:47,848
These are contractors.

773
01:07:47,955 --> 01:07:50,446
I can't tell
what this company does, but...

774
01:07:52,326 --> 01:07:53,315
Hey.

775
01:07:53,427 --> 01:07:54,394
Hey, hey, hey!

776
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,560
Memphis?

777
01:08:00,668 --> 01:08:01,635
Memphis!

778
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,741
For a man who didn't know much,

779
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:14,144
you sure took a long,
painful time to tell it.

780
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:15,840
Get him some water.

781
01:08:24,992 --> 01:08:26,050
Good.

782
01:08:36,604 --> 01:08:37,832
Got to pee yet?

783
01:08:37,938 --> 01:08:39,803
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

784
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:42,205
Look awful suspicious
if you were to go and shoot yourself

785
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:44,573
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

786
01:08:44,678 --> 01:08:46,612
I'm not going to shoot myself.

787
01:08:47,448 --> 01:08:48,540
Sure you will.

788
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,016
Take him out. Get him ready.

789
01:08:51,118 --> 01:08:52,085
No!

790
01:08:57,825 --> 01:08:58,951
That's my gun.

791
01:08:59,059 --> 01:09:00,083
Yeah.

792
01:09:00,628 --> 01:09:03,062
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

793
01:09:03,164 --> 01:09:05,496
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

794
01:09:12,573 --> 01:09:14,097
Quit your struggling.

795
01:09:17,711 --> 01:09:21,511
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

796
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,715
Russo. Russo!

797
01:09:27,822 --> 01:09:29,449
Davis, get out here!

798
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,422
What is the goddamn hold-up?

799
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:17,232
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

800
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,430
Kill you?

801
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:21,167
Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

802
01:10:22,409 --> 01:10:25,207
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

803
01:10:33,454 --> 01:10:36,685
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

804
01:10:37,992 --> 01:10:40,119
Help me toss these boys in the water?

805
01:10:40,227 --> 01:10:42,525
You set me up and you used me as bait!

806
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,463
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

807
01:10:45,566 --> 01:10:46,590
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

808
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,793
but they were
kind of determined to kill you.

809
01:10:48,903 --> 01:10:51,133
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

810
01:10:51,238 --> 01:10:53,172
They can work out some kind of deal.

811
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:57,008
This is explainable. You can prove
that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

812
01:10:57,111 --> 01:10:58,237
I don't think you understand.

813
01:10:58,345 --> 01:10:59,539
These boys killed my dog.

814
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:05,384
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

815
01:11:05,486 --> 01:11:07,044
In the end, the law is all...

816
01:11:07,154 --> 01:11:09,850
In the end,
the law'll never catch and hold them.

817
01:11:09,957 --> 01:11:11,254
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

818
01:11:11,358 --> 01:11:13,883
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story.

819
01:11:14,128 --> 01:11:15,288
And I'll be dead.

820
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,330
It's gonna be
some hard, hairy work, Pork.

821
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:19,524
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

822
01:11:19,633 --> 01:11:22,864
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell
I mean to see it through.

823
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:25,461
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

824
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:30,107
You know, I missed a meeting today

825
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:33,668
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

826
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:36,773
because I was kidnapped by people
that don't exist.

827
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,821
I'll take his legs.

828
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:44,584
It's a good call, Pork.

829
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:47,957
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBI agent

830
01:11:48,062 --> 01:11:49,859
overpowered and killed
the three of them?

831
01:11:49,964 --> 01:11:50,931
No.

832
01:11:51,665 --> 01:11:55,567
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

833
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,700
With a .22.

834
01:12:00,674 --> 01:12:02,904
- Swagger's alive.
- Yes.

835
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:04,443
And that young kid,

836
01:12:04,745 --> 01:12:06,269
FBI Agent

837
01:12:08,749 --> 01:12:09,943
Nick Memphis,

838
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:13,850
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

839
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:17,685
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

840
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:20,827
What?

841
01:12:20,928 --> 01:12:23,089
I just went over
Swagger's financials again.

842
01:12:23,564 --> 01:12:27,227
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

843
01:12:27,434 --> 01:12:29,834
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

844
01:12:29,937 --> 01:12:33,100
Donnie Fenn's widow.
Anniversary of his death.

845
01:12:33,207 --> 01:12:34,401
She went back to using
her maiden name,

846
01:12:34,508 --> 01:12:36,738
which is why we missed it the first time.

847
01:12:37,911 --> 01:12:39,674
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

848
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,839
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

849
01:12:41,949 --> 01:12:45,350
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

850
01:12:45,452 --> 01:12:47,113
It's just within driving range.

851
01:12:48,088 --> 01:12:50,784
- What are you waiting for? Take the jet.
- All right.

852
01:12:58,565 --> 01:13:00,260
We've given Swagger a new war,

853
01:13:00,701 --> 01:13:02,168
he's found a new spotter.

854
01:13:03,537 --> 01:13:05,164
This is about to get worse.

855
01:13:34,268 --> 01:13:35,895
I think we're here.

856
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,265
Hey. Swagger.

857
01:13:42,676 --> 01:13:44,109
I think we're here.

858
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,341
Welcome to Tennessee.

859
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:51,577
Patron state of shooting stuff.

860
01:13:53,854 --> 01:13:55,287
Hey, who is this guy?

861
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:58,916
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

862
01:13:59,026 --> 01:14:01,085
He knows more about guns
and the people who shoot them

863
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:02,253
than Smith % Wesson.

864
01:14:02,362 --> 01:14:04,853
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

865
01:14:04,965 --> 01:14:06,125
- You mind your manners.
- All right.

866
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:09,828
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

867
01:14:10,137 --> 01:14:11,229
Wisdom.

868
01:14:13,273 --> 01:14:14,900
You come to the wrong place.

869
01:14:15,008 --> 01:14:16,270
Maybe.

870
01:14:16,376 --> 01:14:17,968
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

871
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:19,739
and have it match exactly to another.

872
01:14:19,847 --> 01:14:21,212
Could that be done?

873
01:14:21,315 --> 01:14:22,339
Take a seat.

874
01:14:23,217 --> 01:14:24,445
Have a chair, son.

875
01:14:28,722 --> 01:14:32,681
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

876
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:34,283
could make the grooves match.

877
01:14:34,394 --> 01:14:36,726
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

878
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,354
The bullet that was taken
out of the Archbishop

879
01:14:38,465 --> 01:14:40,023
was completely mangled on impact.

880
01:14:40,134 --> 01:14:42,364
FBI match was metallurgical.

881
01:14:42,469 --> 01:14:43,629
Thank you, Mother.

882
01:14:43,737 --> 01:14:46,137
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that
going in, so they had to be sure.

883
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,731
And I still can't figure out
how they could be.

884
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:53,236
- Good coffee?
- Yep.

885
01:14:55,249 --> 01:14:58,412
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

886
01:14:59,319 --> 01:15:01,514
Red leather spine.

887
01:15:01,722 --> 01:15:04,589
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

888
01:15:05,826 --> 01:15:09,660
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

889
01:15:29,349 --> 01:15:31,579
Yeah. Paper patching.

890
01:15:31,685 --> 01:15:34,848
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

891
01:15:34,955 --> 01:15:36,183
Paper-wrapped bullet.

892
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,815
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

893
01:15:38,926 --> 01:15:41,952
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

894
01:15:42,062 --> 01:15:44,087
Leaves no traces when it hits.

895
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:47,827
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

896
01:15:47,935 --> 01:15:49,232
I got another one.

897
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:50,994
I thought you might.

898
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:54,096
Suppose I was looking for a man
to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

899
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:55,903
Who's alive that could do that?

900
01:15:56,476 --> 01:16:00,606
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

901
01:16:00,714 --> 01:16:03,842
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

902
01:16:03,951 --> 01:16:05,050
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

903
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:06,178
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

904
01:16:06,286 --> 01:16:07,753
Yeah, they said that, all right.

905
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:11,551
They also said
that artificial sweeteners were safe,

906
01:16:12,559 --> 01:16:15,084
and WMDs were in Iraq,

907
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:17,857
and Anna Nicole married for love!

908
01:16:19,833 --> 01:16:21,698
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

909
01:16:21,802 --> 01:16:22,860
How come?

910
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:25,530
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

911
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:27,539
That's how a conspiracy works.

912
01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:31,270
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

913
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:35,314
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

914
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:36,848
And you know this for a fact?

915
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,747
Still got the shovel.

916
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:42,752
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

917
01:16:42,856 --> 01:16:44,380
There was a guy in Russia.

918
01:16:44,491 --> 01:16:46,254
They locked his ass up.

919
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,622
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

920
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,395
There was one guy,

921
01:16:52,499 --> 01:16:54,763
but he don't shoot no more.

922
01:16:55,135 --> 01:16:57,899
A brutal son of a bitch.

923
01:16:58,005 --> 01:17:01,133
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

924
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:03,570
wait till his friends come to help,

925
01:17:03,977 --> 01:17:05,137
kill them too.

926
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:07,406
Turned one target into four.

927
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:11,912
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

928
01:17:12,019 --> 01:17:14,283
The other side wanted him. Bad.

929
01:17:14,388 --> 01:17:19,690
Finally narrowed his hide down
to an abandoned six-story building.

930
01:17:20,894 --> 01:17:22,828
They quit the subtle tactics.

931
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:25,557
They called in an artillery strike.

932
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:27,566
Leveled a square block.

933
01:17:27,668 --> 01:17:29,829
Brought the building down on his ass.

934
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:32,370
Some say he crawled out of there.

935
01:17:32,472 --> 01:17:34,201
Some say he died.

936
01:17:34,308 --> 01:17:36,242
Never heard from him no more.

937
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,501
Fuck me.

938
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:39,601
What?

939
01:17:39,713 --> 01:17:41,146
I met the son of a bitch.

940
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,645
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

941
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:50,749
No, sir.

942
01:17:50,857 --> 01:17:52,449
You keep that in mind.

943
01:17:52,559 --> 01:17:54,322
The moment you think you got it figured,

944
01:17:54,494 --> 01:17:55,461
you're wrong.

945
01:17:59,533 --> 01:18:00,591
He got a name?

946
01:18:06,106 --> 01:18:07,539
Hey, it's me, Nick.

947
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,576
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

948
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:13,302
- Yeah.
- Are you okay? Nick, where are you?

949
01:18:13,413 --> 01:18:14,641
It's better I don't tell you.

950
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:17,848
Look, do you have a pen?

951
01:18:17,951 --> 01:18:20,419
I need you to find someone.
Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.

952
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,487
- Yeah.
- You got it?

953
01:18:21,588 --> 01:18:22,577
I got it.

954
01:18:22,723 --> 01:18:24,554
Man, this is hard to spell.

955
01:18:30,764 --> 01:18:33,927
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

956
01:18:34,034 --> 01:18:36,298
He'll try to track the shooter.

957
01:18:36,403 --> 01:18:37,927
He won't get far that way.

958
01:18:38,038 --> 01:18:39,528
Yes, he will.

959
01:18:39,639 --> 01:18:41,732
- How's that?
- We're going to help him.

960
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:44,902
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

961
01:18:52,052 --> 01:18:53,747
And what happens to the bait?

962
01:18:55,288 --> 01:18:56,653
Hard to say.

963
01:18:57,657 --> 01:19:00,319
But that's the nature of being the bait.

964
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:15,739
- Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him?
- He's in Virginia.

965
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:18,903
An end we thought was tied up

966
01:19:19,112 --> 01:19:20,204
came untied.

967
01:19:21,148 --> 01:19:22,809
Meaning, Colonel?

968
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:24,747
Swagger is still alive.

969
01:19:28,188 --> 01:19:29,553
Oh, my.

970
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:34,820
I need to land a transport plane
without a customs check.

971
01:19:36,496 --> 01:19:40,091
I'm certain I don't want to know,
but what's on the plane?

972
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,665
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

973
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:46,762
Twenty-four good, hard men.

974
01:19:46,873 --> 01:19:49,034
Weapons and gear.

975
01:19:49,142 --> 01:19:50,666
Only 24?

976
01:19:52,112 --> 01:19:53,511
Do kill him.

977
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:57,182
No loose ends this time.

978
01:19:58,084 --> 01:19:59,483
Night, Colonel.

979
01:20:01,154 --> 01:20:02,143
Good night, Senator.

980
01:20:21,007 --> 01:20:22,065
Hello?

981
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:25,676
Someone there?

982
01:21:01,948 --> 01:21:03,074
Now look.

983
01:21:03,783 --> 01:21:05,580
Look what you've done now.

984
01:21:08,855 --> 01:21:10,288
Give me that.

985
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:13,382
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

986
01:21:21,902 --> 01:21:23,733
Where's your boyfriend?

987
01:21:25,972 --> 01:21:27,564
What if it's a trap?

988
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:29,373
Oh, it's a trap.

989
01:21:29,476 --> 01:21:31,808
Guaranteed. Every time.

990
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,375
Question is, for whom?

991
01:21:36,883 --> 01:21:38,714
- You got your list, right?
- Yep.

992
01:21:38,818 --> 01:21:41,048
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

993
01:22:09,115 --> 01:22:10,082
Let's go.

994
01:22:15,622 --> 01:22:17,647
Okay, so what are these for again?

995
01:22:18,358 --> 01:22:20,053
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

996
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,718
Right.

997
01:22:21,828 --> 01:22:26,060
Napalm on the first floor.
Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

998
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:30,193
Gotta be very careful with these.
It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

999
01:22:30,303 --> 01:22:32,464
So what exactly
are we getting ready for?

1000
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:34,005
For as much as we can be.

1001
01:22:47,153 --> 01:22:49,383
All right, you got
four enemy combatants.

1002
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:51,218
Take them one by one.

1003
01:22:51,324 --> 01:22:53,258
Keep shooting.
Don't let anything distract you.

1004
01:23:01,868 --> 01:23:02,926
Fuck!

1005
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:07,672
Didn't I say
don't let anything distract you?

1006
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,299
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Let's see it.

1007
01:23:26,393 --> 01:23:27,917
No. No.

1008
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:30,292
It's just you and me, baby.

1009
01:23:30,397 --> 01:23:31,455
No!

1010
01:23:34,534 --> 01:23:36,001
You got three guards.

1011
01:23:36,903 --> 01:23:38,336
One at your 2:00,

1012
01:23:39,739 --> 01:23:40,831
12:00

1013
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,334
and 10:00.

1014
01:23:51,951 --> 01:23:52,975
Danger close. 2:00,

1015
01:23:53,086 --> 01:23:54,053
fifty yards.

1016
01:24:57,684 --> 01:24:58,742
You got one right on you.

1017
01:24:59,185 --> 01:25:00,152
20 yards and closing.

1018
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:52,269
Go check the perimeter.

1019
01:25:52,705 --> 01:25:54,229
And tell the others to stay alert.

1020
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,069
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

1021
01:26:30,243 --> 01:26:31,733
Swagger, you got one above you
on the roof.

1022
01:26:50,463 --> 01:26:51,760
You killed all three?

1023
01:26:52,699 --> 01:26:54,030
There were four.

1024
01:26:54,968 --> 01:26:58,426
I want Johnson's real name.
I want to know who he works for.

1025
01:26:58,538 --> 01:27:00,403
I want to know why it was worth
going through that much effort

1026
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:01,939
to kill the Archbishop.

1027
01:27:02,876 --> 01:27:04,366
Aren't you the one that shot him?

1028
01:27:04,477 --> 01:27:06,536
And if I don't know any of those things?

1029
01:27:06,646 --> 01:27:07,738
Then you're of no worth to me

1030
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:10,008
and I might as well shoot you now
and leave.

1031
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:16,620
Johnson's had a lot of names.

1032
01:27:16,723 --> 01:27:20,489
Don't know one's any more real
than the next.

1033
01:27:20,593 --> 01:27:22,322
Knowing would only be dangerous.

1034
01:27:23,997 --> 01:27:25,521
He's ex-army.

1035
01:27:25,632 --> 01:27:28,066
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

1036
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,463
Go on.

1037
01:27:34,307 --> 01:27:37,071
They came for me,
like they came for you.

1038
01:27:38,244 --> 01:27:40,644
Recruitment for a single job.

1039
01:27:42,348 --> 01:27:43,781
They like the wounded.

1040
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,545
Easier to use

1041
01:27:47,587 --> 01:27:49,555
and then throw away when you are done.

1042
01:27:50,957 --> 01:27:52,948
Timmons, you, me...

1043
01:27:55,595 --> 01:28:00,532
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard
to be staked down like a goat.

1044
01:28:01,634 --> 01:28:06,401
This is just one dead man
talking to another.

1045
01:28:07,473 --> 01:28:08,804
And the Archbishop?

1046
01:28:10,443 --> 01:28:14,277
You want to take all suspicions away
when you shoot someone,

1047
01:28:14,547 --> 01:28:16,947
wait till he's standing
next to the President.

1048
01:28:18,384 --> 01:28:19,817
What was he going to say?

1049
01:28:20,853 --> 01:28:22,184
The truth.

1050
01:28:22,288 --> 01:28:25,849
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

1051
01:28:25,959 --> 01:28:29,451
ever really happens
without the approval of the government.

1052
01:28:29,562 --> 01:28:31,553
Over there, and here.

1053
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:35,463
The problem isn't the doing.

1054
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:39,063
It's the people in power having to admit

1055
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:40,631
that they knew.

1056
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:45,206
The prisoners are tortured
at Abu Ghraib,

1057
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:47,472
and only the underlings go to jail.

1058
01:28:48,214 --> 01:28:49,806
Their bosses knew.

1059
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:52,043
We know their bosses knew.

1060
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:53,379
But you don't say it.

1061
01:28:53,486 --> 01:28:55,215
What exactly happened in Africa?

1062
01:28:55,321 --> 01:28:57,812
Somehow the villagers didn't think

1063
01:28:58,057 --> 01:28:59,957
that an oil pipeline

1064
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,324
was a good enough reason
to move their village

1065
01:29:03,429 --> 01:29:06,865
to a place
where the spirit gods didn't exist.

1066
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:07,933
Drink?

1067
01:29:08,034 --> 01:29:09,092
So they asked them all nicely to move

1068
01:29:09,202 --> 01:29:10,567
and when they didn't,
they just killed them all?

1069
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:11,637
No.

1070
01:29:11,871 --> 01:29:13,099
They didn't ask.

1071
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:14,838
They just killed them.

1072
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:15,908
All.

1073
01:29:16,175 --> 01:29:19,144
So the next village
won't need to be asked.

1074
01:29:19,245 --> 01:29:20,576
They'll just go.

1075
01:29:32,392 --> 01:29:36,624
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

1076
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:40,426
men, women, children,

1077
01:29:40,533 --> 01:29:45,163
under the oil pumping station
10 kilometers over the Eritrean border.

1078
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:48,372
You should know.

1079
01:29:48,474 --> 01:29:52,501
You covered the retreat
of the contractors who did the job.

1080
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,644
Of course, you weren't supposed
to survive that, either.

1081
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:06,952
Who runs Johnson?

1082
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:07,894
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1083
01:30:07,895 --> 01:30:09,452
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1084
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:12,657
You don't get it.

1085
01:30:13,099 --> 01:30:15,192
There is no head to cut off.

1086
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,166
It's a conglomerate.

1087
01:30:18,805 --> 01:30:21,569
If one of them betrays the principles

1088
01:30:23,076 --> 01:30:25,306
of the accrual of money and power,

1089
01:30:26,412 --> 01:30:28,107
the others betray him.

1090
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:30,739
What it is

1091
01:30:33,019 --> 01:30:35,317
is human weakness.

1092
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:39,590
You can't kill that with a gun.

1093
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,467
Swagger.

1094
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:49,557
Swagger.

1095
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:52,467
You got to get out of there.
They're everywhere.

1096
01:30:53,272 --> 01:30:56,366
Had to keep you till they got here.

1097
01:30:57,844 --> 01:31:01,143
Lying wasn't going to hold you.

1098
01:31:01,914 --> 01:31:03,472
You would have known.

1099
01:31:08,454 --> 01:31:11,753
By the way, they've got your woman.

1100
01:31:14,827 --> 01:31:15,885
Swagger.

1101
01:31:15,995 --> 01:31:19,453
They're 20 yards and closing.
You got to get out of there.

1102
01:31:21,234 --> 01:31:23,134
- Bug out. Go to hide two.
- Roger that.

1103
01:31:55,201 --> 01:31:56,862
Swagger, I'm in position two.

1104
01:31:57,770 --> 01:31:58,896
You got to get out of there.

1105
01:31:59,005 --> 01:32:00,472
- They're all over the place.
- Hey!

1106
01:32:01,073 --> 01:32:02,472
Calm down.

1107
01:32:02,575 --> 01:32:05,066
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call,
okay? You got it?

1108
01:32:05,378 --> 01:32:07,175
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1109
01:32:14,754 --> 01:32:15,721
Listen very carefully.

1110
01:32:15,888 --> 01:32:17,515
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

1111
01:32:17,623 --> 01:32:18,590
then the gas.

1112
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:21,388
Three, two, one...

1113
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:52,416
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

1114
01:33:47,546 --> 01:33:48,535
Swagger!

1115
01:33:55,788 --> 01:33:57,085
You got it.

1116
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:09,594
Swagger!

1117
01:34:12,004 --> 01:34:13,562
Swagger!

1118
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:15,604
Swagger!

1119
01:34:22,214 --> 01:34:24,079
You got to bug out
on my go behind that barn.

1120
01:34:24,183 --> 01:34:25,150
Okay.

1121
01:34:25,251 --> 01:34:26,309
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1122
01:34:26,419 --> 01:34:27,443
Go!

1123
01:34:30,923 --> 01:34:31,890
Come on!

1124
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:01,581
You got to gun it to that tree line.

1125
01:35:01,887 --> 01:35:02,854
What?

1126
01:35:03,022 --> 01:35:04,887
You got five shots left.
Gotta draw that bird out.

1127
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:06,321
Okay. Okay.

1128
01:35:06,425 --> 01:35:08,290
- On my cover, all right?
- Okay.

1129
01:35:10,062 --> 01:35:11,051
All right, go!

1130
01:35:24,477 --> 01:35:25,967
Pull up! Pull up!

1131
01:35:42,027 --> 01:35:43,016
Time to go!

1132
01:36:00,913 --> 01:36:01,845
Let me take a look.

1133
01:36:02,281 --> 01:36:03,248
Not right now.

1134
01:36:03,849 --> 01:36:05,146
Morning, beautiful.

1135
01:36:05,251 --> 01:36:07,481
- See this weird shootout in Virginia?
- Sir...

1136
01:36:07,586 --> 01:36:11,920
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants,
blood. No bodies, though, right?

1137
01:36:12,024 --> 01:36:15,653
And they get fingerprints
off the cartridge cases.

1138
01:36:15,761 --> 01:36:18,992
First set positively IDed
as Bob Lee Swagger.

1139
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,236
Second set belongs
to Special Agent Nick Memphis

1140
01:36:24,703 --> 01:36:26,102
of the FBI.

1141
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:27,929
What? That's gotta be wrong.

1142
01:36:31,277 --> 01:36:34,735
Now, the only reasonable question
to ask after that is,

1143
01:36:37,116 --> 01:36:38,344
what the fuck is going on?

1144
01:36:44,356 --> 01:36:45,687
Great shot!

1145
01:36:49,228 --> 01:36:51,753
- All yours, Dan!
- Good shooting!

1146
01:36:51,864 --> 01:36:55,129
I'm beginning to think that you were
the wrong man for the job.

1147
01:36:56,735 --> 01:36:58,202
Think what you want.

1148
01:37:00,739 --> 01:37:04,698
It appears we misjudged
the gunnery sergeant.

1149
01:37:06,512 --> 01:37:08,503
There's always a confused soul

1150
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:11,208
that thinks that one man
can make a difference.

1151
01:37:12,384 --> 01:37:15,512
And you have to kill him
to convince him otherwise.

1152
01:37:17,857 --> 01:37:19,825
That's the hassle with democracy.

1153
01:37:20,326 --> 01:37:21,350
Pull!

1154
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:37,642
Fire under their asses,
you understand me?

1155
01:37:37,743 --> 01:37:39,301
We need those results now.

1156
01:37:39,411 --> 01:37:41,743
Anna, you guys, you take the team...
Anna! ...To the roadhouse.

1157
01:37:41,847 --> 01:37:44,441
Okay, I don't care who it is right now.
I don't give...

1158
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:47,713
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

1159
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,048
Start a trace.

1160
01:37:49,955 --> 01:37:51,547
Got it. I'm on it.

1161
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:53,887
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here.
How are you?

1162
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:57,287
Things have gotten a little complicated.
I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

1163
01:37:58,397 --> 01:38:00,331
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

1164
01:38:00,432 --> 01:38:03,026
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility
had begun to reach us.

1165
01:38:03,769 --> 01:38:04,997
Got him.

1166
01:38:05,104 --> 01:38:06,731
Were you in a gunfight
in Virginia last night?

1167
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:09,637
Like I said,
things have gotten a little complicated.

1168
01:38:09,742 --> 01:38:14,111
Well, obviously the best thing for you
would be to bring him in, right?

1169
01:38:14,213 --> 01:38:16,113
Oh, no. I can't do that.

1170
01:38:16,215 --> 01:38:17,204
Why?

1171
01:38:17,316 --> 01:38:19,307
It's gotten too deep.
It's not clear who can be trusted.

1172
01:38:20,219 --> 01:38:22,585
- But we're the FBI, son.
- Yeah, I know.

1173
01:38:22,988 --> 01:38:24,114
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

1174
01:38:24,423 --> 01:38:25,515
Oh, Nick, wait...

1175
01:38:25,624 --> 01:38:27,524
Son of a bitch.

1176
01:38:27,626 --> 01:38:28,650
- Did we get that?
- Got him.

1177
01:38:28,761 --> 01:38:29,853
- Let's move.
- They're on an interstate

1178
01:38:29,962 --> 01:38:32,192
- outside Bozeman, Montana.
- Let's move!

1179
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:38,937
This is Swagger.

1180
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:40,733
- Colonel Johnson here.
- Figured you'd be listening.

1181
01:38:40,839 --> 01:38:43,239
- It appears you have nowhere to go.
- Colonel?

1182
01:38:43,776 --> 01:38:44,743
If it is "Colonel"?

1183
01:38:45,177 --> 01:38:46,303
It is.

1184
01:38:47,813 --> 01:38:50,839
- I have something you want.
- Well, it seems so do I.

1185
01:38:53,919 --> 01:38:58,686
Over the Eritrean border,
there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.

1186
01:38:58,791 --> 01:39:01,487
Men, women, children.

1187
01:39:02,661 --> 01:39:04,595
Tell you what, I'll give it to you
and we'll call it even.

1188
01:39:04,697 --> 01:39:06,164
I just want someone there I can trust.

1189
01:39:06,265 --> 01:39:08,859
I'm amenable.
Who do you have in mind?

1190
01:39:08,968 --> 01:39:10,868
How about that guy from U2
with the glasses?

1191
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:13,370
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all.
He seems trustworthy.

1192
01:39:13,472 --> 01:39:15,463
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

1193
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:18,907
My colleague's questioning
my choice. Okay,

1194
01:39:19,011 --> 01:39:22,503
I see how that could be a tough
problem. You know, last minute and all.

1195
01:39:23,482 --> 01:39:25,279
How about six-term senator
Charles Meachum

1196
01:39:25,584 --> 01:39:26,812
from Montana?

1197
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:29,752
Seems like a pretty good
second choice, don't you think?

1198
01:39:31,523 --> 01:39:32,785
I don't think so.

1199
01:39:32,891 --> 01:39:35,758
I'm gonna provide you
with two numbers, then we'll talk.

1200
01:39:35,861 --> 01:39:38,489
Point 732. Point 648.

1201
01:39:39,031 --> 01:39:40,225
And what the hell is that?

1202
01:39:40,332 --> 01:39:43,495
Those are the last three digits, down to
a few meters of latitude and longitude,

1203
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:45,593
of an oil pipeline pumping station
in Eritrea

1204
01:39:45,704 --> 01:39:47,035
with 400 bodies underneath.

1205
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:48,934
Where are we meeting?

1206
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:52,702
Somewhere I can see you,

1207
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:56,543
coming from a goddamn long way off.

1208
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:06,381
Where's your boy?

1209
01:41:20,766 --> 01:41:22,393
Well, I'm here.

1210
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,234
He's here.

1211
01:41:32,344 --> 01:41:33,641
Look, look, look.

1212
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,505
There's your boy.
There's your boy, baby.

1213
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:47,283
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

1214
01:41:57,569 --> 01:41:58,866
Okay.

1215
01:42:42,414 --> 01:42:44,041
I think I broke a rib!

1216
01:42:45,684 --> 01:42:46,878
Don't move!

1217
01:42:47,319 --> 01:42:48,752
Is there anybody else?

1218
01:42:49,354 --> 01:42:50,321
No.

1219
01:43:17,249 --> 01:43:19,877
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

1220
01:43:21,186 --> 01:43:23,177
You got no shot!

1221
01:43:23,288 --> 01:43:26,689
No shot, Swagger!
You hear that, Swagger?

1222
01:43:29,461 --> 01:43:31,156
You got no shot!

1223
01:43:31,797 --> 01:43:34,595
What are you gonna do? Come on!

1224
01:43:43,575 --> 01:43:45,236
It's over for you, buddy!

1225
01:43:50,282 --> 01:43:52,910
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

1226
01:44:06,932 --> 01:44:08,456
Not bad!

1227
01:44:08,567 --> 01:44:10,762
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

1228
01:44:13,205 --> 01:44:14,331
Christ.

1229
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:33,282
How can we help you?

1230
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,553
Guest at the motel last night
gave me $100

1231
01:44:35,661 --> 01:44:37,458
to bring this by here at 3:00 p.m.

1232
01:44:41,333 --> 01:44:42,322
Let's move!

1233
01:45:11,229 --> 01:45:12,218
You all right?

1234
01:45:13,031 --> 01:45:13,998
Yeah.

1235
01:45:24,376 --> 01:45:25,343
Search him.

1236
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:27,002
I don't carry a weapon,

1237
01:45:30,015 --> 01:45:31,243
ordinarily.

1238
01:45:31,817 --> 01:45:33,944
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

1239
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,257
Pull the pilot.

1240
01:45:44,863 --> 01:45:46,956
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

1241
01:45:47,065 --> 01:45:48,225
Put your gun down!

1242
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:49,459
Easy. Easy.

1243
01:45:59,911 --> 01:46:00,969
Sarah.

1244
01:46:02,014 --> 01:46:03,641
Give me the gun.

1245
01:46:04,349 --> 01:46:06,112
It's okay. Give me the gun.

1246
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:16,654
You okay?

1247
01:46:16,828 --> 01:46:19,422
Put them up. Keep them up.

1248
01:46:19,531 --> 01:46:21,089
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

1249
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:24,761
Yeah, you got what you came for.

1250
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:27,134
I think it's time you owe us
your side of the bargain.

1251
01:46:27,239 --> 01:46:28,206
You do, huh?

1252
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:31,332
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

1253
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:35,002
Why don't we think about all this
that has gone on

1254
01:46:35,113 --> 01:46:36,876
just as a preamble?

1255
01:46:36,982 --> 01:46:38,847
You got any plans after this?

1256
01:46:39,518 --> 01:46:43,955
You have a rather unique skill set.
I'd be interested in offering you a job.

1257
01:46:44,056 --> 01:46:46,251
Work? For you?

1258
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:50,124
It's not really as bad as it seems.
It's all gonna be done in any case.

1259
01:46:50,228 --> 01:46:53,789
You might as well be on the side
that gets you well paid for your efforts.

1260
01:46:53,899 --> 01:46:55,958
And what side are you on?

1261
01:46:56,068 --> 01:46:58,935
There are no sides.
There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

1262
01:46:59,037 --> 01:47:00,197
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

1263
01:47:00,305 --> 01:47:02,603
There's only haves and have-nots.

1264
01:47:02,707 --> 01:47:05,699
What exactly does working for you
entail, Senator?

1265
01:47:06,111 --> 01:47:09,308
Raping and murdering innocent women
and children, you sick fuck?

1266
01:47:09,414 --> 01:47:11,245
You sanctioned the mass murder
of an entire village

1267
01:47:11,349 --> 01:47:12,338
so a pipeline could go through.

1268
01:47:12,451 --> 01:47:14,043
One village!

1269
01:47:14,152 --> 01:47:16,177
And it brought stability to the region.

1270
01:47:16,288 --> 01:47:19,451
Which means that no one
chops off their arms

1271
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:21,355
because their
grandmother's grandfather

1272
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:23,052
belonged to a different tribe.

1273
01:47:24,062 --> 01:47:25,552
They like us down there, boy.

1274
01:47:32,604 --> 01:47:34,697
This is a country

1275
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,635
where the Secretary of Defense

1276
01:47:39,811 --> 01:47:41,403
can go on TV

1277
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:43,907
and tell the American public,

1278
01:47:44,116 --> 01:47:47,745
oh, that "This is about freedom!
It's not about oil!"

1279
01:47:48,553 --> 01:47:50,487
And nobody questions him,

1280
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:52,022
because they don't want to hear
the answer

1281
01:47:52,124 --> 01:47:53,455
because it's a lie!

1282
01:47:55,894 --> 01:48:00,126
There's only so many places
at the table, Gunnie.

1283
01:48:00,532 --> 01:48:02,193
Now are you on the inside,

1284
01:48:02,534 --> 01:48:03,831
or are you on the out?

1285
01:48:10,909 --> 01:48:12,240
It's the FBI!

1286
01:48:13,078 --> 01:48:14,670
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

1287
01:48:17,415 --> 01:48:20,782
If one of them betrays
the principles of the accrual...

1288
01:48:20,886 --> 01:48:22,547
I don't think so, Senator.

1289
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:28,725
- What are you doing?
- Saving our lives.

1290
01:48:29,161 --> 01:48:31,288
- That proved you were innocent!
- Nobody out here is innocent!

1291
01:48:31,396 --> 01:48:35,230
This stuffs plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

1292
01:48:35,333 --> 01:48:38,791
You hand it over to the authorities,
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1293
01:48:38,904 --> 01:48:41,896
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

1294
01:48:42,007 --> 01:48:43,531
I'm out, old man!

1295
01:48:43,642 --> 01:48:46,440
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

1296
01:48:46,545 --> 01:48:47,842
You happy?

1297
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:53,913
Where do you think you're going?

1298
01:48:54,019 --> 01:48:55,452
Washington!

1299
01:48:55,554 --> 01:48:59,991
You going to shoot
a sitting U.S. senator in the back?

1300
01:49:00,091 --> 01:49:01,649
Lord knows I want to.

1301
01:49:02,527 --> 01:49:03,960
I didn't think so.

1302
01:49:05,230 --> 01:49:06,424
Let him go.

1303
01:49:07,465 --> 01:49:09,092
They've got your rifle.

1304
01:49:10,702 --> 01:49:13,136
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

1305
01:49:13,238 --> 01:49:14,899
Recovered at the site.

1306
01:49:22,247 --> 01:49:24,909
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

1307
01:49:25,383 --> 01:49:27,874
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1308
01:49:27,986 --> 01:49:30,477
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

1309
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:36,820
I won.

1310
01:49:37,862 --> 01:49:39,227
You lost.

1311
01:49:40,031 --> 01:49:42,192
Get used to the idea, son.

1312
01:49:42,667 --> 01:49:44,100
I'm not your son.

1313
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:01,014
- Drop your weapons! Put it down now!
- Don't move!

1314
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:04,680
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBI!
Don't shoot!

1315
01:50:04,789 --> 01:50:06,950
- Down, now!
- On the ground!

1316
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:08,583
I said get down!

1317
01:50:27,946 --> 01:50:30,574
- Could I free my hands, please?
- It's okay.

1318
01:50:30,682 --> 01:50:32,309
Thank you, sir.

1319
01:50:33,785 --> 01:50:35,446
Thanks for bringing her.

1320
01:50:40,992 --> 01:50:43,620
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1321
01:50:43,728 --> 01:50:46,026
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1322
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:52,396
This is Attorney General Russert.

1323
01:50:53,405 --> 01:50:55,999
- Director Brandt.
- Sir.

1324
01:50:56,107 --> 01:50:58,439
Senator Meachum couldn't be
with us today.

1325
01:50:58,543 --> 01:51:00,704
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1326
01:51:00,812 --> 01:51:01,811
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1327
01:51:01,812 --> 01:51:03,041
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1328
01:51:04,115 --> 01:51:07,346
Against my better judgment,
I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBI.

1329
01:51:07,452 --> 01:51:08,919
What the hell am I doing here?

1330
01:51:09,154 --> 01:51:11,247
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

1331
01:51:11,723 --> 01:51:13,122
Call the Joint Chief.

1332
01:51:14,759 --> 01:51:16,056
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1333
01:51:16,161 --> 01:51:18,527
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

1334
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:21,098
from highly-ranked
and powerfully-placed individuals

1335
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:22,689
telling me to let you go.

1336
01:51:22,801 --> 01:51:25,895
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

1337
01:51:26,838 --> 01:51:28,305
and am, indeed, required by law,

1338
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,635
to tell them to fuck off.

1339
01:51:30,742 --> 01:51:32,403
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

1340
01:51:32,510 --> 01:51:34,444
so you sit there and be quiet.

1341
01:51:38,083 --> 01:51:40,074
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1342
01:51:40,185 --> 01:51:41,311
Thank you.

1343
01:51:43,521 --> 01:51:45,250
This is my weapon.

1344
01:51:45,357 --> 01:51:47,689
No question about it, don't deny it.

1345
01:51:47,792 --> 01:51:50,158
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

1346
01:51:50,261 --> 01:51:51,228
We agree?

1347
01:51:51,963 --> 01:51:53,487
It's been in the FBI's possession
ever since,

1348
01:51:53,598 --> 01:51:54,997
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1349
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:56,624
No. Absolutely not.

1350
01:51:56,735 --> 01:51:58,862
- You fire the weapon?
- There was no point.

1351
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:01,131
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

1352
01:52:01,239 --> 01:52:04,140
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

1353
01:52:04,242 --> 01:52:06,608
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1354
01:52:07,746 --> 01:52:09,407
Definitely my gun.

1355
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:11,982
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that Archbishop?

1356
01:52:12,083 --> 01:52:13,607
Nope. No, I don't.

1357
01:52:13,718 --> 01:52:16,243
- Have any proof of this fact?
- No.

1358
01:52:16,354 --> 01:52:17,787
- Trust me?
- Yep.

1359
01:52:17,889 --> 01:52:19,049
Really trust me?

1360
01:52:19,424 --> 01:52:20,391
Yeah.

1361
01:52:21,459 --> 01:52:22,653
With your life?

1362
01:52:23,261 --> 01:52:24,660
- Yep.
- Good.

1363
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:28,597
- What the hell are you doing?
- Put that weapon down now!

1364
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:31,533
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

1365
01:52:31,636 --> 01:52:33,126
Ain't gonna make a difference
this close.

1366
01:52:33,238 --> 01:52:34,364
Only thing
that's gonna make a difference

1367
01:52:34,472 --> 01:52:35,996
is whether I'm crazy or not.

1368
01:52:42,414 --> 01:52:44,177
I could keep doing this all day,

1369
01:52:44,916 --> 01:52:46,508
with every weapon in my house.

1370
01:52:47,018 --> 01:52:50,078
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

1371
01:52:50,188 --> 01:52:52,213
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1372
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:54,055
But the gun don't shoot.

1373
01:52:54,459 --> 01:52:56,450
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

1374
01:52:56,561 --> 01:52:58,324
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1375
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:01,661
I did take an oath to defend this country
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1376
01:53:01,766 --> 01:53:04,064
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

1377
01:53:04,169 --> 01:53:05,932
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

1378
01:53:06,037 --> 01:53:08,597
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

1379
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:11,034
Whatever.

1380
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:13,277
Who gives a shit?

1381
01:53:14,612 --> 01:53:16,079
Nice presentation.

1382
01:53:16,181 --> 01:53:17,978
But none of it sticks to me.

1383
01:53:19,184 --> 01:53:22,381
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1384
01:53:22,487 --> 01:53:23,749
Done.

1385
01:53:23,855 --> 01:53:25,186
I'll be seeing you.

1386
01:53:25,290 --> 01:53:28,487
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

1387
01:53:28,593 --> 01:53:29,787
Yeah, in this country.

1388
01:53:29,894 --> 01:53:32,522
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1389
01:53:37,936 --> 01:53:43,397
These images are from a classified file
showing a village of people in Africa

1390
01:53:43,508 --> 01:53:46,204
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

1391
01:53:46,311 --> 01:53:47,278
My God.

1392
01:53:47,479 --> 01:53:48,673
Look around you.

1393
01:53:49,247 --> 01:53:51,374
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

1394
01:53:51,483 --> 01:53:53,041
That's all hearsay.

1395
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:55,779
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

1396
01:53:55,887 --> 01:53:57,320
And I'm free to go.

1397
01:53:57,956 --> 01:53:59,753
Colonel, your moral compass is
so fucked up,

1398
01:53:59,858 --> 01:54:03,794
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

1399
01:54:03,895 --> 01:54:06,022
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1400
01:54:07,065 --> 01:54:08,555
these events occurred
in another country,

1401
01:54:08,666 --> 01:54:09,963
outside of our laws.

1402
01:54:10,068 --> 01:54:12,593
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

1403
01:54:12,704 --> 01:54:14,729
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1404
01:54:15,607 --> 01:54:17,905
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

1405
01:54:18,009 --> 01:54:20,671
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

1406
01:54:20,778 --> 01:54:24,305
- Sir, I urge you to reconsider...
- There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1407
01:54:27,785 --> 01:54:29,412
I win.

1408
01:54:29,521 --> 01:54:30,749
You lose.

1409
01:54:31,489 --> 01:54:32,456
Again.

1410
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:36,384
This is ridiculous.

1411
01:54:58,683 --> 01:55:02,244
For the record, I don't like the way
this turned out any more than you do.

1412
01:55:02,954 --> 01:55:04,854
But this is the world we live in.

1413
01:55:04,956 --> 01:55:07,891
And justice does not always prevail.

1414
01:55:07,992 --> 01:55:08,959
It's not the Wild West,

1415
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:11,358
where you can clean up the streets
with a gun.

1416
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:15,530
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

1417
01:55:20,171 --> 01:55:21,437
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1418
01:55:21,438 --> 01:55:22,701
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1419
01:55:26,844 --> 01:55:28,641
Unshackle the sergeant.

1420
01:55:31,983 --> 01:55:34,213
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

1421
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:35,581
In the face.

1422
01:55:36,988 --> 01:55:39,218
You heard that expression,

1423
01:55:39,324 --> 01:55:41,622
"You didn't know whether to shit
or go blind"?

1424
01:55:45,597 --> 01:55:48,828
You should've seen the look
on the Attorney General's face.

1425
01:55:49,934 --> 01:55:54,234
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

1426
01:55:54,339 --> 01:55:57,740
"This is about evidence and the truth!"

1427
01:55:57,842 --> 01:56:00,367
And then you just said to him,

1428
01:56:00,478 --> 01:56:01,775
"Fuck you!"

1429
01:56:02,847 --> 01:56:05,247
"Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G."

1430
01:56:07,518 --> 01:56:08,815
"Fuck you!

1431
01:56:10,588 --> 01:56:13,022
"The truth is what I say it is!"

1432
01:56:20,098 --> 01:56:22,430
You know, you got to be
out of the country in the morning.

1433
01:56:22,533 --> 01:56:24,296
You're going to Ecuador.

1434
01:56:27,772 --> 01:56:31,367
Well, we're having some problems
with the locals.

1435
01:56:31,476 --> 01:56:35,037
We have our personnel on the ground
ready to neutralize the problem, but...

1436
01:56:35,313 --> 01:56:37,008
Well, they've requested you.

1437
01:56:38,783 --> 01:56:40,148
It's solvable.

1438
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:44,014
They requested you...

1439
01:56:46,357 --> 01:56:47,381
Swagger.

1440
01:56:52,263 --> 01:56:53,321
Turn off the lights!

1441
01:57:00,905 --> 01:57:01,929
Get my car.

1442
01:57:02,106 --> 01:57:03,232
Get my car.

1443
01:57:23,094 --> 01:57:24,061
Do something.

1444
01:57:24,862 --> 01:57:26,090
Do something!

1445
01:57:34,405 --> 01:57:35,531
Where is he?

1446
01:57:48,219 --> 01:57:49,345
He's under the floor!

1447
01:58:20,151 --> 01:58:21,743
You don't need to kill me.

1448
01:58:23,087 --> 01:58:24,714
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

1449
01:58:25,156 --> 01:58:26,123
It was them.

1450
01:58:28,926 --> 01:58:31,690
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

1451
01:58:33,898 --> 01:58:36,298
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.

1452
01:58:38,636 --> 01:58:42,037
Are you out of your mind?
Are you out of your damn mind?

1453
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:44,973
I am a United States senator!

1454
01:58:45,176 --> 01:58:46,143
Exactly.
