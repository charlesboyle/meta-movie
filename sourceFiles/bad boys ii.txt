1
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:18,165
Ja, all this is under control.

2
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:42,106
A hundred and fifty million dollars
and my dope is on the way.

3
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:44,817
Today is gonna be a good day.

4
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:49,530
We are 25 degrees north,
84 degrees west.

5
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:52,283
The cargo's being dropped.

6
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:26,275
Good.

7
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:28,361
- Do you want to see his gun?
- Yeah.

8
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:33,741
Bang. Bang.

9
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:37,495
Sorry, Johnny.

10
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,163
Fucking bitches.

11
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,378
Infrared's got a live one
on the water.

12
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,588
Air Force Stallion C-14
to Coast Guard.

13
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:52,260
We've got a fast-moving contact
heading 3-5-0 toward South Florida.

14
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:55,429
Captain, Air Force Stallion has a
contact at 1-8-0 closing fast.

15
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:58,808
This is Coast Guard cutter Valiant.
Request to know your intentions.

16
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:01,811
Vessel off our port bow,
this is U.S. Coast Guard.

17
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,856
Intercept is 1-8-0, speed 17 knots.

18
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:06,691
Make it so, chief. Scramble the helo.

19
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,197
Vessel off our port bow.

20
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,824
This is U.S. Coast Guard.

21
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:17,451
Request to know your intentions
at this time.

22
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:23,332
Incoming.

23
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:36,429
Valiant, Valiant.

24
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:38,514
This is Coast Guard 6-0-0-3.

25
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,933
Negative contact with target. Over.

26
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:42,727
Captain, we've lost target.

27
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:58,075
Here's your delivery and payment.

28
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:02,330
Is it done?

29
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,416
- Cargo is on Dixie 7.
- Okay.

30
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:18,346
All right, TNT, for the millionth time,
listen up.

31
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:22,767
Since 9-11, we've gone hi-tech over
water. Dope runners have gone low.

32
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:25,937
Our source says the biggest X
shipment on record arrives tonight...

33
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:27,855
...and we want to know
who's behind it.

34
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:30,900
Hopefully in a few hours
we'll have our answer.

35
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,652
We'll hit from three directions:

36
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,490
We'll go in with a water team, vehicle
assault and we got guys on foot.

37
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:42,537
We cannot make a move until our UCs
have ID'd the drugs and called us in.

38
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:46,332
No call, we back away.
And these guys we're going after...

39
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:51,003
...they got a lot of firepower and they
hate the law. So eyes open out there.

40
00:04:58,135 --> 00:04:59,637
Bravo's on the move.

41
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,201
Heads up. Here comes the drop.

42
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,170
Fuck. My lens is flaring.

43
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:34,088
I can't see shit.

44
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:38,050
Brothers! Gather around!

45
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,929
Hey.

46
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:45,516
- Why didn't you say there was a rally?
- Who's looking?

47
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:48,394
- Take that shit. I'm out of here.
- Shit.

48
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:52,732
- White power!
- White power!

49
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:55,318
- White power!
- White power!

50
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:02,491
Blue power, motherfuckers.
Miami PD.

51
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,244
Aw, damn. It's the Negroes.

52
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,414
Casper, drop the bag.
Alpha leader, bring them in.

53
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:11,626
Bad boys, bad boys
What you gonna do?

54
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:14,795
What you gonna do
When we come for you?

55
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:22,011
- Dude, you gotta learn the words.
- We usually only do the chorus.

56
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,013
Alpha leader, hit it. Br...

57
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,515
Repeat your transmission.

58
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,602
Alpha leader to Bravo Four,
please continue relay.

59
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:31,729
Where's backup?

60
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:35,233
- Alpha leader, bring them in. Hit it.
- Mike, I'm only getting static.

61
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:37,276
It's all static.
The radios are fucked.

62
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:41,948
- Something funny? Something funny?
- Mike, where are they?

63
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,579
Got you, nigger.

64
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:54,418
- Looks like we got us a situation here.
- You won't shoot.

65
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:58,214
You got a gun to his head, so you
think I won't splatter you all over?

66
00:06:58,422 --> 00:06:59,423
That's what I think.

67
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,468
My partner came here tonight
prepared to die.

68
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:03,719
Hell... Hell, no!

69
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:06,556
Incinerating trash like you.
Ready to die, right, Marcus?

70
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:09,475
- The fuck I want to do that for?
- Scared, ain't you, boy?

71
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:12,186
A: Put the gun down, tell me
who brings this shit in...

72
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:14,522
...and maybe I'll just
pop one in your shoulder.

73
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:17,358
Or B: Keep acting all Brody
and I'll put one in your chest.

74
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:20,319
Or C: You know, take the time
to talk a minute.

75
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:22,989
You know, de-escalate the situation.

76
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:25,533
See, that's my partner's
new spiritual bullshit.

77
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,369
Me? I actually prefer shooting
motherfuckers.

78
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,413
A lot of movement going on.

79
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,789
Can't see the UCs.

80
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:34,417
- I think something's going down.
- Don't move yet.

81
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,878
Mike, the man has a gun to my head.

82
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:39,463
He'll put it down if a hollow point's
in his eye!

83
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:41,465
Your partner's a cocky nigger.

84
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,844
- Damn. Now, was that necessary, sir?
- See?

85
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:47,388
He can't just be a cop?
He got to be a nigga too?

86
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:48,556
I'll hot this fool.

87
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,017
- Calm down.
- Calm down? I'm calm.

88
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:54,687
I'm calm! Hey! Whoa! Whoa!

89
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:56,772
I am way too unstable
for that bullshit.

90
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,610
Stop all the goddamned movement!
Everybody stop moving!

91
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:03,779
We can't let you all go, but this
shit'll get worked out in court.

92
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:05,907
We got our rights.

93
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:08,284
Exercise your right
to shut the fuck up.

94
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:13,873
I'm all right. I'll give you a warning.
It's the best I can do for all of youse!

95
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,708
Okay? He's crazy.

96
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,879
- You got 3 seconds to drop your gun.
- He has anger issue problems!

97
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,215
- One.
- He goes to bed early for this shit!

98
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,926
Just to wake up to pop one
in a motherfucker!

99
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:26,844
- Two!
- Mike, no!

100
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,095
Gun!

101
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:32,642
Rock 'n' roll! Let's go!

102
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,185
Kill them cops!

103
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:07,468
Marcus!

104
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,214
Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, go!

105
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:52,597
- Get down!
- Drop the...!

106
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,267
- I didn't do shit!
- Get your hands up.

107
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:57,435
I didn't do it!

108
00:09:57,643 --> 00:10:01,063
The radios were fucked up. Get some
medics over here. You guys okay?

109
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:03,691
- Yeah, we're fine.
- What you mean, "we"?

110
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:06,485
Motherfucker shot me
in the ass, man.

111
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:10,531
- Who shot you in the ass?
- Who? That "who" would be you.

112
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,700
- Me? I shot you?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,329
I mean, I was shooting.
Yeah, I did a lot of shooting.

114
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:18,956
But I ain't saying I shot you
in the ass.

115
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,751
I ain't saying I didn't shoot you...

116
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:25,755
...but, damn! Somebody shot you
in the ass.

117
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,048
Tell me about it.

118
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:29,383
- Yo, man, how's it feel?
- It's hot, man.

119
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:31,302
I can smell my ass burning.

120
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,680
Mike, you should give it a little kiss
so it'll feel better.

121
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,682
Pretend like we're not even here.

122
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,769
Hey, isn't Ricky Martin having
a concert? Get the fuck on.

123
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:42,772
- You always gotta go racial, man.
- It's sad, man.

124
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:47,777
I think it's cool. It hit the meat.
It ain't nowhere near the hole.

125
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:51,614
Two lousy bags?

126
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:55,535
What about the biggest shipment
of ecstasy to come out of Amsterdam?

127
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:57,411
Let me worry about my snitch,
all right?

128
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:59,622
It's a lot of cop work for nothing!

129
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,666
Take your ass home somewhere.

130
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:12,176
Tonight la policia jacked my mules.

131
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:17,223
Who can tell me how those jackals
knew where to bite Johnny Tapia?

132
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,809
Speak up, cousins.

133
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:23,104
You're lucky they did not find
my drugs on Dixie 7.

134
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,064
Change the boat schedule.

135
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,650
We can't.
We got a shipment Thursday.

136
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:31,028
Change it after.
Just keep them guessing.

137
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:37,493
You know, unlike you, my daddy
didn't leave me no trust fund.

138
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:40,079
I got real-world shit
to deal with, Mike.

139
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:42,623
I'm not in it for the thrills.

140
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,792
Same old shit, different day.

141
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,671
All right, yes, damn.
I shot you, all right?

142
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,841
But you'd be seeing nothing at all
if I hadn't made my move.

143
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,676
I don't know why
you acting so angry.

144
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:57,054
- You're misinformed. I'm not angry.
- No, you're very angry.

145
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,098
No, I'm not angry.

146
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:02,894
You are angry. It's okay.

147
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,523
I'm not angry. Except when
you keep repeating "you're angry."

148
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,692
That shit's fucking annoying.

149
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,778
Like a fucking gnat at a barbecue.

150
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:15,281
Just bugging the fuck out of me.

151
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,408
Good. I want you to say:

152
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:21,954
"I'm angry. It's okay.
I'll process my anger.

153
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:23,873
I love myself.

154
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,458
Whoosah."

155
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,251
I don't know what the fuck
you mean.

156
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:29,879
Yes, you do know what the fuck
I mean.

157
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,589
You're the one that needs therapy.

158
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:33,049
- I did my therapy.
- When?

159
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:36,302
Capt. Howard made me do it after
I shot them people at the airport.

160
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:40,181
Whoosah.

161
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,683
Whoosah!

162
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,769
Officer Mike.

163
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:49,690
- Papi. That's "daddy," right?
- Yeah.

164
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,235
Whoosah.

165
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,988
Mike, you go to therapy
to get your issues worked out...

166
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:57,949
...not bang your therapist.

167
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:01,577
- See, now you just talking nasty.
- I gotta survive.

168
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,372
I gotta start loving me for me.

169
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,624
That sound like that group thing.

170
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,585
Maybe I did the group thing
once or twice.

171
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:11,462
Whoosah.

172
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:14,090
- And whoosah.
- Whoosah.

173
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:19,178
A bunch of men hugging and kissing,
that's some cult shit.

174
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,301
Buy.

175
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,386
Ignore him, doc, he's blowing
this out of proportion.

176
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:46,516
My ass is what's out of proportion,
Mike, okay? I got a big chunk missing.

177
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:48,184
It's actually a small chunk.

178
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:50,770
This tension you bringing
into this relationship...

179
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,522
...won't be healthy
in the long run.

180
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,815
Maybe there ain't gonna be
no long run.

181
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,234
Whatever.

182
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,152
He's seeing a shrink. I mean...

183
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:05,201
- Icepick, Lowrey.
- Hey, brother.

184
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:08,412
Two bags? You embarrassed me
in front of my people.

185
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:11,874
Wait, brother. No, no, no, brother.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

186
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,669
Whatever. You better pray
to whoever it is you pray to...

187
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:18,548
...because you got 24 hours
to find that X before I find you.

188
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:27,098
The cops hit my mule.

189
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:30,142
Well, Mr. Tapia, I don't know
where the heat is coming from.

190
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:33,062
It's a delicate situation
for both of us, isn't it?

191
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:36,566
- I'm telling you, I've checked them.
- Alex, look. A guy's OD'ing.

192
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,109
I'm sorry, I gotta hang up.

193
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,736
Some fucking punk
thinks he can die in my club.

194
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:45,867
Ecstasy fucks them up.

195
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:50,204
- Get him out of here, Josef.
- We'll dump him around the block.

196
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,253
Dump him.

197
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:18,941
Auntie Syd, it must be so cool.

198
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,360
Young, single, living in New York.

199
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:23,779
Probably hook up
with a lot of cute guys.

200
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:27,575
- Just like Sex and the City.
- Theresa, cancel the damn cable.

201
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:30,703
So, Auntie Syd,
you're a cop too, huh?

202
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:33,623
Sort of. I work for the DEA,
but I just push a lot of papers.

203
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:36,083
- Nothing exciting.
- Well, you keep pushing papers.

204
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,962
Don't have to worry about
my little sister fighting crime.

205
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:41,172
Okay?

206
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,050
Possibly getting hurt.

207
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:48,471
James. Get my screwdriver.
Damn bolts.

208
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:50,890
Ignore him. He's being mean
because he got injured.

209
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:54,268
- Are you okay?
- His wound is fine. It's...

210
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:57,063
...other things
that were affected.

211
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,814
- Theresa!
- What?

212
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:02,568
You... It's just nerve damage,
that's all.

213
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:06,113
Y'all not gonna spoil it.

214
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,698
I'll talk to you about it.

215
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,167
It's a donut.

216
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,502
It's a medical thing.

217
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,713
I got it from a maternity store.
You know, pregnant women use it.

218
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,967
They can put one cheek here.
It take pressure off the other cheek.

219
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:28,427
- For you, dog.
- Thoughtful.

220
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,013
Look, man...

221
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:34,100
...last night there was something
different in your eyes.

222
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:37,270
You know, Mike, I had an epiphany.
You know?

223
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,482
- I realized you're an enigma.
- Yeah, I could see that.

224
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:44,652
God sent you here to test me.
But guess what?

225
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:47,738
You not gonna break me, Mike. No.

226
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:49,907
Whoosah.

227
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:51,784
Is that Syd?

228
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,995
- That's Syd.
- Now's not a good time.

229
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,164
Mike, listen, now's not a good time.

230
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,832
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

231
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,877
No throwing balls in the house.

232
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:07,049
Whoosah.

233
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,843
- What's up, Theresa?
- Hey.

234
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:11,053
Aw, they ain't tell me it was a luau.

235
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,934
Syd, hold up. Hold up.
Hold on.

236
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,770
Behave yourself, girl. Hey, hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

237
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:22,440
Oh, look at you. Look at you.

238
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:24,859
Oh, okay. Okay. I see now.

239
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,903
You didn't tell Marcus
about New York.

240
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:31,032
- He knows about New York.
- About us? You told him about us?

241
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,117
No, he knows about New York.

242
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:37,455
You know, it's a nice city and that I
dropped a witness off last month.

243
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,543
Mike is so sweet.

244
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:47,215
- So sweet he make your teeth rot.
- So have you told him yet?

245
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:50,426
Baby, soon, okay? Real soon.

246
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:54,096
He needs to know you're transferring
and won't be his partner anymore.

247
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:55,973
Theresa, timing is everything.

248
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:58,267
Marcus is not very happy
with me right now.

249
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:02,104
No, no, Syd, I'm telling you, that is
Scarface limping around in there.

250
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:05,358
We need to give that boy a few
minutes to let his butt heal up good.

251
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:07,443
We like each other.
What's the big deal?

252
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:10,613
I'm just gonna go tell him right now,
because this is dumb.

253
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,907
Hold up. Hold up. I'm gonna tell him.

254
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:15,451
It ain't like I won't tell him.
How am I not tell him?

255
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,328
- When?
- I need a minute.

256
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:20,873
Straight up. We're not vibing
right now. I just need a minute.

257
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:25,461
Mike, he's my brother, okay?
Don't be scared. Toughen up, chief.

258
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,464
Whoa. Hey.
Hey, I ain't say I was scared.

259
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,634
Just... There's something wrong
with your brother.

260
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:38,599
So, Mike, I understand you
were in New York last month.

261
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:42,854
Yeah, I was...

262
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,398
- Remember I did the thing?
- No.

263
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:46,941
You remember?

264
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:50,903
The two of you should've gotten
together. That would've been nice.

265
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,990
I never told you Mike was in New York.

266
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:56,117
Well, you know what, Mike?

267
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:59,579
Syd, she's gonna be in town,
what, another week?

268
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:01,873
Why don't you show her around?
That'd be nice.

269
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,499
That would be so great.

270
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,794
Yeah. Yeah, I could...
Well, me and...

271
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,756
Marcus, you want to show her
some stuff?

272
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,385
Yeah, because I'm in town
on vacation.

273
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:16,512
I'm staying
at the most amazing hotel.

274
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:19,557
The view, the pool. Oh, my God.

275
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:20,975
We got a pool right here.

276
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,103
That ain't exactly a pool, man.

277
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:27,773
That's like a big-ass puddle
wrapped in blue plastic.

278
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:30,693
Didn't they have any good pools
when you bought this one?

279
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:32,904
Megan, that pool cost $3900.

280
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,031
Okay, so how much
do the good pools cost?

281
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,201
- It's all right, baby.
- It is kind of whack, huh?

282
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:42,330
I gotta go meet somebody.
It was nice seeing you again, Mike.

283
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,499
Nice... Good to see you.

284
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,001
Where you going?

285
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,294
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

286
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:50,171
I thought you were on vacation.

287
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:52,632
So glad you could join us, Mike.

288
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,801
I'm telling you, spending time like this
make a partnership strong.

289
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,803
Mike, can I see you
by my stupid pool?

290
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,640
What's the deal, baby?

291
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:04,477
Why you gotta always come over
here and try to take over, Mike?

292
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:07,855
- What are you talking about?
- This is my family, man. Okay?

293
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:10,399
- What are you talking about?
- My place of peace.

294
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,360
Are you taking medication?

295
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:14,445
You taking medicine
for the thing, right?

296
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:16,822
- What'd I do?
- Forget it. Just forget it.

297
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:19,575
- What'd I do?
- Mason. Go fetch.

298
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,876
Oh, shit!

299
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:35,216
Now, that shit is funny.

300
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,718
That's some funny shit.

301
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,720
Oh, man, hold up.

302
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:41,764
Yo, Lowrey, you hot.

303
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:44,350
Thirty-nine hundred dollars.
Thirty-nine hundred.

304
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,229
You better pray to God you right
this time. Yo, dry off, sweetheart.

305
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,607
Icepick said the Haitian Zoepounds
about to do a rip. Let's move.

306
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:05,746
All right, guys, smarten up.
Talk to me.

307
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,583
Eyes on, agents. Good luck.

308
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,543
This is 105.

309
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:14,380
They're backing in.

310
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:15,965
I got a good look.

311
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:18,718
- We got a good eyeball.
- All right, we're in.

312
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:26,559
What's up?

313
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:37,612
You come highly recommended
out of New York.

314
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,073
You did some good jobs
for our Russian crew up there.

315
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:42,617
How old are you?

316
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:44,202
Old enough.

317
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:47,788
Come on. If you want to move
this stuff you gotta do it quick.

318
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:52,168
Wow, nice getup. You can start
to run these through.

319
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:54,212
I'd like to see
how your machine works.

320
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:57,798
Ooh, that sounded dirty.

321
00:22:58,007 --> 00:23:01,260
"I would like to see how
your machine works, baby."

322
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:03,971
I wouldn't be so crude.

323
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,557
I mean, I'm more of a refined kind
of a human being.

324
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:09,894
You follow ballet?

325
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:14,857
Three of my cousins are dancing
with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.

326
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:19,403
I like hippie-hop too.

327
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:26,577
I gave you 5000.

328
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,162
You gave me 4900.

329
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:30,206
- I gave you 5000.
- 4900.

330
00:23:30,373 --> 00:23:31,415
- 5000.
- Count it.

331
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:35,169
If you want to fuck with me again,
find yourself another chump.

332
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:36,796
Okay.

333
00:23:39,715 --> 00:23:41,259
- How much?
- Three.

334
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:44,011
Look at this. Money everywhere.
Clean it up.

335
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,349
Okay, we want to change a little
over $3 million, all right?

336
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:52,019
How many jobs did you do with
my friends up there in New York?

337
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:53,187
Quite a few.

338
00:23:53,396 --> 00:23:56,399
How you behave with me
has consequences for a lot of people.

339
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:58,734
You found me,
not the other way around.

340
00:23:58,943 --> 00:24:02,446
You need me to change small bills to
large ones and deliver to a third party.

341
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:04,866
I bet he'd like his money
in a timely fashion.

342
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:07,618
Delivery's late, it's your ass,
not mine.

343
00:24:21,257 --> 00:24:24,177
Here's 50,000 in 100s
for your 50,000 in 10s.

344
00:24:24,385 --> 00:24:27,096
Third party takes his million
in these five briefcases here.

345
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:30,099
- I hope I'm not losing you, chief.
- I hate math.

346
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:32,935
So for your $3 million
that we shrunk for you...

347
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:35,313
...you get 2 million in clean money
back.

348
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:38,357
Less our percentage: $300,000.

349
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:42,278
- I'll be delivering these to your dealer.
- Alexei.

350
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:44,572
- What?
- We're giving too fucking much away.

351
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:47,074
We take all the risk.

352
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:50,286
And our suppliers take too much
of our profit.

353
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,664
Yeah, we'll call the general,
renegotiate.

354
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,876
He's a businessman,
we're businessmen.

355
00:24:57,502 --> 00:24:58,794
Yeah, call him.

356
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:00,254
You call.

357
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:03,174
Agents, we're on the move
to the money drop.

358
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:05,843
Forward.

359
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:09,055
Hey, man, the truck's leaving.
We're going to follow it.

360
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:14,310
Don't lose that truck.

361
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:18,648
Follow that truck. Follow that truck.

362
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,160
Yep, they saddling up.
Look like Icepick came through.

363
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:33,913
Wonder whose shit
they about to rip now?

364
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:17,373
Falcon One, do you see her?

365
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,043
Stand by.

366
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,546
I don't want to get spotted,
take a burn.

367
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:26,090
Zoepound a bunch of pirates, man.
Steal anything.

368
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,149
Black Suburban at 10 o'clock.

369
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,569
Oh, come on, baby.
Park it at the top.

370
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:48,446
Roberto, she's coming to you.

371
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:53,659
I got her.

372
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:58,706
This is Falcon One, guys.
I got her coming up.

373
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:01,375
Heads up, guys.
I got an orange muscle car.

374
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:03,920
Looks to be three black male
occupants.

375
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:06,547
It's out of our field of vision.
Bring it up.

376
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:09,091
All right, be aware,
we got three bogeys unidentified.

377
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:22,939
Guys, we got three bogeys.
They're splitting up. They're moving.

378
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,066
Be aware. They're approaching...
Shit. Shit.

379
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:31,030
- Fuck, it's a hit!
- Shit.

380
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:42,166
Agent down. Agent down.

381
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,087
Roberto, fucking follow them!

382
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:47,755
- I'm on it! I'm on it!
- Shit!

383
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:49,841
Stay here!

384
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,592
Son of a bitch!

385
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,551
It's Syd!

386
00:28:34,802 --> 00:28:36,637
Move! Move!

387
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:42,518
Man, what is your sister into?

388
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:55,239
Sidewalk! Sidewalk!

389
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:57,742
Move! Move!

390
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:01,037
Shit.

391
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:13,716
- Shit!
- I need backup on Canal, now!

392
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:21,641
You just get ready to shoot.

393
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:26,729
Police!

394
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:29,315
Stop the car!

395
00:29:29,524 --> 00:29:32,401
Man, your badge?! He has a gun!
Shoot him!

396
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,086
Mike, she's in trouble, man.

397
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:54,715
Move! Get out of the way!

398
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:10,898
I think I done just got mad.

399
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:21,826
- Gun! Gun! Gun!
- Hold on.

400
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:34,005
Now show them your badge!

401
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:07,371
- This shit is crazy.
- I know, right?

402
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:09,207
Move! Move!

403
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:30,353
Get the world down here!

404
00:31:57,046 --> 00:31:58,506
Shit!

405
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,391
Go! Go!

406
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,526
Get out!

407
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:20,444
You, drive!

408
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:29,662
Go!

409
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,797
Go, go, go, Mike! Punch that shit!
Punch it!

410
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:03,404
Kill the fucker!

411
00:33:13,873 --> 00:33:15,166
Shit!

412
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:21,964
Move! Move!

413
00:33:26,802 --> 00:33:28,638
- Don't lose her, Mike!
- This is what I do!

414
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:47,490
Shit! Shit.

415
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:49,742
Definitely shoot
that motherfucker that just...

416
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:51,410
Oh, man, my headlight.

417
00:33:53,162 --> 00:33:54,914
Shoot back! Shoot back!
Shoot! Shoot!

418
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:09,679
What the...?!
What are you doing, man?

419
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:11,973
- That's my bad.
- Shoot outside!

420
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:14,016
Pay attention to what you're doing.

421
00:34:32,118 --> 00:34:33,661
These dudes is off the chain!

422
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:45,256
Jesus! Fuck!

423
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:55,516
- This is some sick shit!
- Yep, it's about to get sicker.

424
00:35:06,152 --> 00:35:07,653
Watch out! Watch out!

425
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:10,781
Oh, sh...!

426
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,285
- Oh, they are not about to do that.
- Hell, yes, they are!

427
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:15,995
Go!

428
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:28,925
- You see that?!
- They throwing cars! How can I not?!

429
00:35:34,096 --> 00:35:37,058
- I'm just trying to help, okay?!
- You know what'd be fucking helpful?

430
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,810
Just shut the fuck up and let me drive!
Let's try that!

431
00:35:47,693 --> 00:35:50,154
Hey, come on, man,
with the screaming shit!

432
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:53,783
I'm concentrating on dodging
these fuckers.

433
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,041
Just relax.

434
00:36:08,506 --> 00:36:10,466
- That was a flip!
- That motherfucker flipped!

435
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:13,970
- That one puckered up my butthole.
- Almost fucking crushed my head.

436
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:35,158
The boat!

437
00:36:57,763 --> 00:37:01,267
I lost them. Yeah, I've got your cargo
to the backup drop point.

438
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:08,107
Attention all units,
suspects still at large.

439
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,361
There she is.

440
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:21,204
What the fuck is going on, Syd?

441
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:23,539
Some desk you're driving.

442
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:26,834
Get over here, I'm undercover.
And please call off your dogs.

443
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:29,670
I got DEA watching my back,
so don't blow my case.

444
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:32,256
- We saved your life.
- And I appreciate that.

445
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:34,926
What I don't appreciate is
you two following me here...

446
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:37,553
...nearly burning a case
that took five months to set up.

447
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,473
So now we lie to each other?
Is that what we do?

448
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:42,475
- What do you want me to do?
- All right.

449
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:46,103
- Fuck that, Mike, she's wrong.
- Calm down. Relax.

450
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:48,272
Syd, are there drugs in that truck?

451
00:37:48,523 --> 00:37:50,358
- There's cash.
- Where's it going?

452
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:53,069
- I can't tell you that.
- Why not?

453
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:56,572
Because I have a career and if I
want to keep it, I have rules to follow.

454
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:57,865
What's that mean?

455
00:37:58,032 --> 00:38:01,536
My orders are, under no circumstances
share information with Miami PD...

456
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:05,164
...because they got too many leaks.
- Oh. I'm Miami PD now?

457
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:07,250
You done forgot I'm your big brother,
huh?

458
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:10,378
You know what, Syd,
that shit you did was reckless...

459
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:13,381
...it was stupid and it was dangerous.
Okay?

460
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:17,885
I'm telling Mommy. Okay?
I'm definitely leaking that shit.

461
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:19,220
Hey, Marcus...

462
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:23,432
Syd, come on, he got a point.

463
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,226
Your brother loves you.

464
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:28,271
Not to mention a little thing
called professional courtesy.

465
00:38:28,437 --> 00:38:32,066
You bouncing in somebody's yard,
you should let them know about it.

466
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:39,282
First time using your gun?

467
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:43,369
Hey, you handled yourself
very well.

468
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,621
Too bad your partner didn't notice.

469
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:48,708
Thanks.

470
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,961
Think you get off that easy? You
been working this for five months?

471
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,880
How come you ain't tell me
in New York?

472
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,882
- What would you have said?
- I would've...

473
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,718
I'd have let you know this job
is rugged, you know.

474
00:38:58,885 --> 00:39:01,512
It's dangerous. And if something
happen to you I might...

475
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:04,682
Exactly why I didn't say anything.

476
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:13,774
Somebody's stealing your money.

477
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,031
The drop's done. I gotta go.

478
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:25,995
Thanks.

479
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:47,183
We gotta close this case
before it get her killed.

480
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:48,893
Yeah, no doubt.

481
00:39:49,268 --> 00:39:52,021
You ready to go back to the station,
get our asses whupped?

482
00:39:52,688 --> 00:39:54,815
I think we gonna be all right.

483
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:57,819
Fellas.

484
00:39:58,027 --> 00:40:00,029
What's your job description?

485
00:40:00,446 --> 00:40:01,823
No, you two.

486
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:04,867
What is your job description?

487
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:06,035
I'll tell you.

488
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:08,412
TNT:

489
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:11,374
Tactical Narcotics Team.

490
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,876
Keyword: "tactical."

491
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:19,131
"Displaying finesse and subtlety
in achieving a goal!"

492
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,051
Tell me, gentlemen...

493
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,389
...what was subtle about your work
today?

494
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:33,855
Twenty-two cars...

495
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,315
...and a boat, totaled?

496
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:39,569
How did you sink a boat?

497
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:44,532
We didn't sink it.

498
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:52,290
Whoosah.

499
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:58,462
All right, the positive.
Thank God no cops died.

500
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:03,718
The negative: I got a police
commissioner so far up my ass...

501
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:06,929
...if he spits it's coming out
of my mouth.

502
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:12,560
But I know that there's
always two sides to a story.

503
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:14,604
So, what's yours?

504
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:17,440
Well, I was at a family barbecue.

505
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:19,525
We got a tip that the Zoepounders...

506
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:23,321
...were gonna do a hit on cash or
drugs from this big-time X-Man.

507
00:41:23,488 --> 00:41:25,948
That's what they call
a ecstasy dealer on the streets.

508
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:28,242
Marcus, I know what they call them.

509
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,411
That's why I'm captain. It's cool.

510
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:32,413
So you got the drugs.

511
00:41:33,915 --> 00:41:37,293
No drugs. Oh, okay. All right.
How about the money?

512
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:38,836
- No money.
- Nope.

513
00:41:39,045 --> 00:41:40,505
Then who is this X-Man?

514
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:43,424
Captain, I was at a family barbecue.
So I...

515
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:46,469
We don't know,
but we are going to find out.

516
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:48,638
Well, then all that...

517
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:51,349
...was for nothing?
- We didn't do all of that.

518
00:41:51,557 --> 00:41:54,352
If you look close...
Watch. Hold up. Let me s...

519
00:41:54,644 --> 00:41:58,189
There's DEA all over.
Wait, the... Wait, hold up.

520
00:41:58,397 --> 00:42:00,441
The DEA? Without consulting me?!

521
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,318
That's a DEA car right there.

522
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,196
Christ! Fuck!

523
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:08,783
Cap. No. Remember
your pressure points.

524
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:11,369
Do my... My exercises.

525
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,454
- Holler at your boy.
- Whoosah.

526
00:42:15,414 --> 00:42:18,042
Twenty-one thousand?
What?!

527
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:21,838
Oh, kiss my black ass.

528
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:24,298
It was the dashboard.

529
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:27,468
- You know what?
- Better.

530
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,136
Yeah, you'll get your money.

531
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:31,472
Somebody's on they way
with your money.

532
00:42:34,392 --> 00:42:37,228
Is it possible we could discuss
potential reimbursement...

533
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:40,523
We don't cover personal property.
That's why we drive police cars.

534
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,358
So where do we go from here?

535
00:42:43,317 --> 00:42:46,320
Zoepounders knew exactly when
to hit the drop, where to hit the drop...

536
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,489
...so we figure they know
where the cash is.

537
00:42:48,698 --> 00:42:50,533
We find the cash, we find the X-Man.

538
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,078
Hey, I'm through playing games,
all right? I have three cops critical.

539
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:57,039
I got kids dying on my streets
from souped-up X.

540
00:42:57,206 --> 00:43:01,043
I do not want these animals
taking over my city.

541
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,336
Do you understand?

542
00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:06,299
So I want you guys to do whatever you
do, whatever it takes, but do it now.

543
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:15,558
It's not good, boss.

544
00:43:20,897 --> 00:43:22,481
Oh, my God.

545
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:28,070
Fucking ratones eating
my fucking money.

546
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:33,993
Carlos, this is a stupid
fucking problem to have.

547
00:43:34,285 --> 00:43:37,705
But it is a problem nonetheless.

548
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:39,790
Rat fuckers.

549
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:41,584
Rat fuckers.

550
00:43:44,295 --> 00:43:45,588
Boss, it ended up crazy.

551
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:50,092
This black chica working for the
Russians was a maniac lunatic.

552
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:51,302
She saved your money.

553
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:53,930
She wasted some Haitians
and got the load to the drop.

554
00:43:54,096 --> 00:43:56,933
Also, Roberto saw these two
crazy gangbanger homeys.

555
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,935
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah. Chasing and shooting.

556
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,063
Old days, did I have
this problem? No.

557
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:05,817
Just fly the drugs in
and ship the money out.

558
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:11,906
Now American security's
so goddamned tight over the water...

559
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:13,241
...and in the sky...

560
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:16,786
...that the rats eat my money
before I can get it to Cuba.

561
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:21,249
- You see?
- Fiery crash...

562
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:25,419
I can't even get my money across town
without making the news.

563
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:28,881
Hey, man. Man.

564
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:30,758
Tell me...

565
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:33,344
...should I be worried?

566
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:35,638
- No, boss.
- Shut the fuck up.

567
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:39,016
People is trying to jack my loads
here in Miami.

568
00:44:39,225 --> 00:44:42,144
I own this fucking town. You see?

569
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,813
This is my town.

570
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:48,067
Oh, my God. Pink.

571
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:51,404
Pink, niña, pink. Pink.
No powder blue.

572
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:52,780
Pink is prettier.

573
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:55,992
But the lady at the store
said I look like a model.

574
00:44:57,493 --> 00:45:01,706
You're lucky your mother
was my mother's cousins.

575
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:03,749
Don't pay attention to Roberto.

576
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:07,879
Besides, models are filthy creatures.

577
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:10,006
You look more like an angel.

578
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:13,009
- What do you think, Carlos?
- Of course.

579
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:15,970
- Roberto, what do you think?
- It's fucking beautiful.

580
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:21,267
Talk polite in front
of my little bonbon...

581
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:24,854
...or I'm gonna chop your balls off.

582
00:45:27,064 --> 00:45:30,693
For real, I'm straight with all your
spiritual enlightenment and that shit.

583
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:34,489
But I need to know if a crackhead rolls
to me with a.9, you'll cook that fool.

584
00:45:34,697 --> 00:45:36,949
No question about it.
Shoot him in the leg.

585
00:45:37,116 --> 00:45:38,576
Come on with that leg shit.

586
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:41,871
- Everybody deserves a little dignity.
- What about my dignity?

587
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:44,999
Your crackhead will be missing
a kneecap. I'll be in a body bag.

588
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:47,168
- So sad.
- What's so sad?

589
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:50,046
Your untreated control issues.

590
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:51,589
It's not your fault.

591
00:45:52,256 --> 00:45:54,383
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

592
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,762
Your mama probably refused you
her tit when you were a baby.

593
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:00,723
You grew up a malnourished
high-school softie.

594
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,476
Got your gun, little tight T-shirt...

595
00:46:03,643 --> 00:46:06,270
...and became
a overcompensating tough guy.

596
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:12,568
That is the last time you will ever
refer to my mother's titties.

597
00:46:13,653 --> 00:46:15,822
I don't even want them
up in your head.

598
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:21,744
You know, I said all that, Mike,
and all you heard was "titties."

599
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:25,414
Man, you can't keep suppressing
my spiritual growth, Mike.

600
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:28,918
You need to suppress my mother's
titties out of your psychoanalysis.

601
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:32,797
You just remember one thing,
my friend. I may not always be here.

602
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:37,969
What's up, Icepick?

603
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:42,056
Jesus is the way, my brothers.
Step inside.

604
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:44,559
You just went number one
on Uncle Mike's shit list.

605
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:47,645
- We got two lousy bags, man.
- My brothers.

606
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:49,939
Haitian blond with dreads.
Where is he?

607
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:51,649
Blondie Dread?

608
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:55,361
He's very expensive.

609
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,240
You and you
have to do something for me.

610
00:46:59,448 --> 00:47:01,784
Oh, you trying to get gangster
on me like that?

611
00:47:02,118 --> 00:47:04,287
- Yeah, he went gangster.
- So we should probably...

612
00:47:04,453 --> 00:47:06,956
- So we want to do the... You got them?
- Yeah, sure.

613
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:11,127
Me and my partner, we're on
the Miami PD tandem dance team.

614
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:13,629
We got a routine.
We won all the local talent shows.

615
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:15,298
We thinking about going national.

616
00:47:15,464 --> 00:47:17,884
You want to show him
some of the routine?

617
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:21,095
Warm it up. Don't hurt nothing.

618
00:47:21,262 --> 00:47:22,638
Yo, yo, watch this. Watch this.

619
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:25,141
This the shit right here.
This is the shit.

620
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:36,986
- What you doing to my shop?!
- Watch this spin.

621
00:47:37,153 --> 00:47:38,279
Wait.

622
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:43,451
- What are you doing?!
- Oh, give me some.

623
00:47:44,076 --> 00:47:45,369
You're ruining my shop. Stop!

624
00:47:45,995 --> 00:47:48,789
- Do the dance thing.
- I'm gonna bring the house down.

625
00:47:54,962 --> 00:47:56,547
Stop! Stop!

626
00:47:57,215 --> 00:48:01,135
He lives in a pink house
eight blocks from here on Carl Street.

627
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:08,392
One...

628
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:10,853
- Police! Get down.
- Police!

629
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:49,058
Who that? Who in my house?!

630
00:48:49,267 --> 00:48:53,354
- I'm the devil, who's asking?!
- The devil is not welcome here!

631
00:48:53,604 --> 00:48:56,524
You got to call yourself the devil
in his house?! Shit!

632
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,443
You're in my house!

633
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:01,445
This is all your fault!

634
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:04,323
- You're in my country, though.
- Fuck you, how's that?

635
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,410
- I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!
- Your country, my ass!

636
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,038
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

637
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:12,707
You no problem!

638
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:15,585
Mike, do you have to be
so combative?

639
00:49:15,793 --> 00:49:17,295
Fucking...!

640
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,630
You calling me a bitch?!

641
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:23,301
Do or die, man!

642
00:49:23,551 --> 00:49:26,596
A bullet in the head'll
really mess up your extensions.

643
00:49:26,804 --> 00:49:29,432
Take your bullet
and eat that shit, man.

644
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,225
How about that?

645
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:37,565
What the fuck?

646
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:48,409
Sir, we just want to talk.

647
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,120
You want to talk?! Well, go ahead.
Go ahead.

648
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:52,914
We're not immigration.

649
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,167
They can't hear you because
they're still shooting at you.

650
00:49:57,126 --> 00:50:00,463
Fucking Haitians in
a fucking little-ass room...

651
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,174
...with fucking guns. Shit!

652
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:18,731
Got to make it home to my babies.
Damn, now.

653
00:50:25,905 --> 00:50:28,366
Motherfucker! You killed my brother!

654
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,871
That's a bitch!

655
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:37,166
Shoot them. Fucking shoot them.

656
00:50:40,962 --> 00:50:42,922
They shot me.
They got me, man. Yo!

657
00:50:57,103 --> 00:50:58,271
Got you.

658
00:51:02,066 --> 00:51:04,152
Oh, shit! Motherfucker!

659
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,695
They killed the boy!

660
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,071
They kill me!

661
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:08,990
They're killing everybody!

662
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:11,993
Motherfucker!

663
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:18,499
My eyes!

664
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:20,501
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

665
00:51:25,423 --> 00:51:27,008
Come. Come kill me, motherfucker.

666
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:29,302
Come. You don't take me alive.

667
00:51:29,468 --> 00:51:31,429
You got three seconds
to drop your weapon!

668
00:51:31,596 --> 00:51:33,097
I got a present for you!

669
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:35,224
- A nice present for you!
- One!

670
00:51:37,018 --> 00:51:38,978
- Two!
- I'm gonna kill you.

671
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:49,906
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, man.
Don't kill me.

672
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:56,746
- Bullets and all... Excuse me.
- You all right, man?

673
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:02,418
Apologize to that man.
Apologize to that man.

674
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:04,921
Apologize! Apologize.

675
00:52:05,796 --> 00:52:07,590
Hey, listen, I owe you...

676
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,468
It's just that, you know,
you was disrespect...

677
00:52:10,676 --> 00:52:13,471
But that don't mean it give me
the right, though. It don't.

678
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,182
Excuse me. Whoosah. Whoosah.

679
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,226
Whoosah, motherfucker!

680
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:24,690
See, the interesting thing is he's
the one of us that's not pissed off.

681
00:52:24,857 --> 00:52:27,652
- I don't know nothing.
- I didn't ask you no question yet!

682
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:29,403
- I don't know nothing.
- Lying already?

683
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,656
- No, get...
- How'd you know about the drop?

684
00:52:31,823 --> 00:52:33,658
- I don't know nothing!
- Stop lying!

685
00:52:33,825 --> 00:52:35,284
Do you know anything?

686
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,454
I'm gonna be nice about it.
Do you know anything?

687
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:40,665
Let's ask some other suspects.

688
00:52:40,832 --> 00:52:44,126
- Hey, look, man, fuck it.
- Let's try this. Let's talk to his homeys.

689
00:52:45,086 --> 00:52:46,796
Hey, look here, man.

690
00:52:47,004 --> 00:52:50,800
Can you tell me who was driving
the black Suburban?

691
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:54,011
Oh, he don't know nothing.

692
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:56,347
His brains is under the end table.

693
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:01,310
He can't tell us shit, Mike.

694
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:03,980
- He's all fucked up.
- What's your point?

695
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:06,649
Dead suspects can't say shit.

696
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:10,862
It seems like live suspects don't say
shit either, so I'll hot this dude here.

697
00:53:11,028 --> 00:53:13,197
- Save us the paperwork.
- I don't know nothing!

698
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:16,617
I don't do motherfucking surveillance,
man. He do surveillance.

699
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:19,078
He don't let nobody
touch his camera.

700
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:24,458
- What's on that camera?
- Trigger Mike strikes again.

701
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:27,211
Hi, welcome to Phat's.
How can I help you?

702
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,339
- Miami PD.
- Whoa. Cops. I love that show.

703
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:33,050
- We need to see what's on this video.
- Absolutely.

704
00:53:33,217 --> 00:53:36,804
You got a little bullet hole in there.
You guys tell me about it?

705
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,474
Guess not. We'll put this
in our central floor model.

706
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:42,935
It has kick-ass bass.
You like hip-hop? I love it.

707
00:53:43,102 --> 00:53:46,814
We freestyle in the break room. If you
guys ever want to kick it, we'll flow.

708
00:53:47,231 --> 00:53:50,610
We're gonna set you up on
the wide-screen. Correct ratio.

709
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,445
There you go.

710
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:57,992
"Spanish Palms Mortuary."

711
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:02,121
Why would they be doing
surveillance at a funeral home?

712
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:03,915
Is that a Cuban flag?

713
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,042
Right there. See the gun?

714
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:10,213
Never knew guards at funeral homes
needed to carry them kind of weapons.

715
00:54:13,508 --> 00:54:15,510
It just seems like
we should turn it off...

716
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:17,220
...because my dad owns the store.

717
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:19,055
She got a tongue ring.

718
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:23,893
- This is like a porno. We're not...
- Dude. Dude.

719
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,436
- All right?
- Yeah.

720
00:54:27,313 --> 00:54:28,731
Okay. Okay.

721
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,317
It's just, you know,
my dad's gonna be...

722
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:33,069
I just need to... I think I...

723
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,279
- I think I screwed this up.
- Relax.

724
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:40,076
- My dad's gonna... This is like a porno.
- Oh, yeah. I want more.

725
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:45,373
- Okay.
- This is official police business.

726
00:54:46,123 --> 00:54:48,543
- What the fuck's going on here?
- Out of my way.

727
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:50,795
My dad is coming.
My dad is coming.

728
00:54:51,796 --> 00:54:53,631
What the hell is going on
in my store?

729
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:58,219
Son, how did this porno crap get
on my videos in my store?!

730
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:01,264
What the hell is going on in here?!

731
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:06,352
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right, Mike.

732
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:10,565
Three days of this shit.
Got my nerves all rattled.

733
00:55:14,402 --> 00:55:16,112
My ass still hurts...

734
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:19,407
...from what you did to it
the other night.

735
00:55:19,782 --> 00:55:21,117
Oh, my Lord.

736
00:55:21,742 --> 00:55:23,411
Yeah, it got rough.

737
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,246
You know?

738
00:55:25,454 --> 00:55:29,375
I mean, we got caught up
in the moment, shit got crazy.

739
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:30,668
You know how I get.

740
00:55:33,713 --> 00:55:37,258
When you popped me from behind,
I think you damaged some nerves.

741
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:38,926
Okay.

742
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:41,387
Now, I can't...

743
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,432
I can't... Now, I can't...

744
00:55:45,641 --> 00:55:48,811
- Can't what?
- I can't even get an erection.

745
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:51,189
What's an erection?

746
00:55:51,355 --> 00:55:55,234
I tried taking Viagra, you know,
pop one, pop two.

747
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,278
Been eating them like Skittles.

748
00:55:57,445 --> 00:56:00,114
That poor man is pouring out
his heart.

749
00:56:00,948 --> 00:56:02,950
And I'm still flaccid.

750
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:05,953
Okay. I'm comfortable talking
to you...

751
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,247
It's got 5.1 Dolby.

752
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,542
...about what I did to your ass...

753
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,504
...but you not getting an erection...

754
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,548
...that's a real problem for me.

755
00:56:17,715 --> 00:56:20,218
- I just figured I could talk to you.
- Yeah. No, no.

756
00:56:20,384 --> 00:56:24,764
We're... We partners, but we are
partners with boundaries.

757
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:27,183
We got a new rule.

758
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:31,354
From now on you can't say
the word "flaccid" to me.

759
00:56:31,854 --> 00:56:33,481
He's a mean fuck.

760
00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:35,983
Look here.
This is our little boundary box.

761
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,985
So we gonna take the word
"flaccid"...

762
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,947
...and we're gonna put it in there
with my mom's titties...

763
00:56:41,113 --> 00:56:44,408
...with your erection problems,
and we're gonna close this box...

764
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:46,702
...and we're gonna throw
this bitch in the ocean.

765
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:49,956
And the only way that you can
get to this box...

766
00:56:50,122 --> 00:56:53,042
...is you got to be motherfucking
Jacques Cousteau.

767
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:54,877
We cool?

768
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,053
Oh, shit.

769
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:06,347
We gotta go.

770
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:09,934
In front of my babies you got porno
and homo shows up in here?

771
00:57:10,142 --> 00:57:12,270
What kind of freak-ass store is this?

772
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,023
And you two motherfuckers
need Jesus.

773
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,900
Cover your ears, baby.

774
00:57:19,152 --> 00:57:21,571
Palm Mortuary, owned by an offshore
holding company...

775
00:57:21,737 --> 00:57:23,739
...which, after 17 layers of bullshit...

776
00:57:23,906 --> 00:57:27,076
...turns out to be registered
to Donna Maria Tapia...

777
00:57:27,368 --> 00:57:31,038
...mother of Hector Juan Carlos Tapia,
who calls himself Johnny.

778
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,374
Johnny Tapia. Shit.

779
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,585
Every time the PD goes after him...

780
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:39,005
...he sues for wrongful arrest.
And, oh, does he win.

781
00:57:39,213 --> 00:57:41,757
Last year he was awarded $9 million.

782
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,052
And got a dozen dumb-ass officers
like you fired.

783
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,263
Well, he hasn't run across us yet.

784
00:57:47,513 --> 00:57:49,807
We'd love to hear what's going on
in that house.

785
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:52,435
Use your computer brain
and tap the phone.

786
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:58,900
Well, that happens to be
highly illegal without a judge.

787
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:04,655
We were thinking of something more
along the lines of a training operation.

788
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:06,073
No, I can't do that.

789
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,826
- Get you tickets to the Heat game.
- I need floor seats.

790
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:11,412
With thick-ass glasses
you don't need floor seats.

791
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,414
He can see the game
from the parking lot.

792
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:17,335
- I can't work under these conditions.
- Floor seats to the Heat. You got it.

793
00:58:17,543 --> 00:58:19,837
- Lakers.
- Yes, Lakers.

794
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:21,756
Okay. Watch me work.

795
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:35,770
Hello? Is this the pest control?

796
00:58:35,978 --> 00:58:38,606
Yeah. We got a fucking problem.

797
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,149
You know where we live.

798
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:42,652
- Yeah, South Miami.
- We got it.

799
00:58:43,444 --> 00:58:44,445
Got our way in.

800
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,489
- Illegally?
- You got to put a word to it.

801
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:47,782
It's like, secret.

802
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:49,784
So y'all want to kill roaches?

803
00:58:49,992 --> 00:58:52,662
- Illegal.
- We'll plant a couple gypsy wires...

804
00:58:52,912 --> 00:58:54,330
...find out what Tapia's up to.

805
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:56,749
These are your basic household bugs.

806
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,334
Dog, this is what we do.

807
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:04,924
- What's the sprayers for?
- The roaches.

808
00:59:05,132 --> 00:59:08,511
- Roaches? We got rats.
- Say what?

809
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,847
That's not an issue.
We can handle that.

810
00:59:11,097 --> 00:59:14,267
We'll just have to slightly adjust
our approach a little bit.

811
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:17,311
Nope. Nope. I don't mess
with no rats.

812
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,480
Hey. Stop it.

813
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:23,151
- We're in. Get your head right.
- Mike, I'm a grown-ass man.

814
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,987
Get your grown-ass self together
and let's do this.

815
00:59:27,905 --> 00:59:30,950
- You got a beautiful house, sir.
- Well, start looking.

816
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,162
They're all over.

817
00:59:41,669 --> 00:59:42,837
Those ain't normal rats.

818
00:59:43,045 --> 00:59:45,840
What he means is that they're
obviously a special breed.

819
00:59:46,048 --> 00:59:48,509
- What kind of breed are they?
- Big motherfuckers.

820
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:51,137
Disposing of the rats isn't a problem.

821
00:59:51,345 --> 00:59:54,182
But we should ensure there's no
breeding elsewhere in the house.

822
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,058
Yeah, at Zook...

823
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:59,353
...we like to work from the outside in,
you know.

824
00:59:59,604 --> 01:00:02,356
So we gonna leave these...
Excuse me.

825
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:05,026
We'll leave these here
and send in a special unit.

826
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,445
It'd be better to begin
in the rest of the house.

827
01:00:07,653 --> 01:00:09,363
You're not getting
in the rest of the house.

828
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,449
We won't be able
to guarantee our work.

829
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:14,035
The only thing that we can
guarantee...

830
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,913
...is that these rats will keep fucking.

831
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:19,707
Giving off offspring
until we find the colony.

832
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,043
Rats don't got no stinking colony.

833
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,045
Well, actually these are colonial rats.

834
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:27,423
What they do is they send out
worker rats that are called...

835
01:00:27,632 --> 01:00:29,425
Marsupials.

836
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:31,427
Marsupials.

837
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:35,765
These drones, they're explorers
of the rat world, you know.

838
01:00:35,973 --> 01:00:38,893
They just looking for rat pussy.

839
01:00:40,478 --> 01:00:42,772
- You know.
- Are you fucking with me?

840
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,608
Hold on. You called us.
We can leave.

841
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:49,195
But what you should understand is
that these rats will hump twice a day.

842
01:00:49,403 --> 01:00:52,448
All right. Down there. Just kill them
and bring me the bill.

843
01:00:55,493 --> 01:00:57,995
That's that bullshit.
That's that bullshit right there.

844
01:00:58,162 --> 01:00:59,872
- You see these rats?
- Plant your wires.

845
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:02,583
- You're not leaving me with them.
- Plant your wires.

846
01:01:04,836 --> 01:01:07,171
Gentlemen. Alexei, Josef.

847
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:11,259
Oh, I really like that word, Johnny.
"Gentlemen."

848
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:15,012
I'm just trying being civil.
This is business, we can all relax.

849
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:17,640
- Alexei, would you like a Cohiba?
- Why not?

850
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:20,309
Of course. And you? Josef.

851
01:01:20,518 --> 01:01:23,104
I'm told you're a wine connoisseur.

852
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,313
I am.

853
01:01:24,856 --> 01:01:29,694
Carlos, have Josef pick a wine and
Alexei and I will have a cigar. Come.

854
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,911
- Where the fuck you going?
- Pretty bad problem you got here.

855
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,415
I'm gonna head down to the truck,
get some poison pellets and stuff.

856
01:01:42,623 --> 01:01:44,500
Come straight back.
No screwing around.

857
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:49,839
They're all over.

858
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,800
Nice place you got here.

859
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:58,639
It's Mama's. And it's a shithole.
Built a fucking million years ago.

860
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:01,434
- Expensive shithole, eh?
- Oh, no.

861
01:02:01,642 --> 01:02:06,314
My new place I'm building in Cuba.
Esto va a set tremendo, brother.

862
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:10,359
Almost finished. Everything fucking
shiny new. Come on upstairs.

863
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,070
Oh, shit.

864
01:02:13,905 --> 01:02:16,991
Oh, shit! Look at the balls
on that motherfucker.

865
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:58,407
Roberto...

866
01:02:58,616 --> 01:03:02,411
...the general's office camera is out.
- Everything in this house is broken.

867
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:11,379
My wire's planted.

868
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,756
- How about yours?
- Almost got three wires planted.

869
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:20,888
Mike!

870
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,434
There's a papa rat humping
the shit out of this mama rat.

871
01:03:25,643 --> 01:03:28,104
No, he's straight pile-driving her!

872
01:03:28,312 --> 01:03:31,399
Now, how is that information
gonna help me do my job?

873
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,651
They fuck just like us.

874
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:35,611
Where's the pest guy?

875
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,298
There's something going on
down here.

876
01:04:10,605 --> 01:04:12,482
Goddamn rats.

877
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:16,110
Yeah, they everywhere.
Just like cockroaches.

878
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,279
No disrespect...

879
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:22,617
...but I do not wish to talk business
until my partner return.

880
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:26,787
It's baffling. You secretly decide to pay
me less and you talk about respect?

881
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:30,917
Let's wait for Josef. You know,
me and digits.

882
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:34,086
Carlos, could you bring Josef in?

883
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:49,769
So...

884
01:04:52,313 --> 01:04:54,357
...your partner is here.

885
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,361
Would you like to talk now?

886
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:02,657
Carlos, another box.

887
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:10,581
So you sign over ownership papers
for all the Florida clubs you own...

888
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:12,708
...and I will control everything...

889
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,253
...from point of origin to sale. Okay?

890
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:19,006
No middleman. Especially Russian
middleman.

891
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,759
With all due respect, Mr. Tapia...

892
01:05:22,635 --> 01:05:26,097
...in my country, I see such things
all the time.

893
01:05:26,305 --> 01:05:28,057
I'm sorry for your country.

894
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:32,061
That must be some Cuban stupid
tradition to put them in a tortilla bin.

895
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:34,772
Now, listen to me, you Russian punk.

896
01:05:35,022 --> 01:05:39,735
I, me, Johnny Tapia,
will sever your head off!

897
01:05:39,944 --> 01:05:43,281
You kill me and you will have
a shit-storm.

898
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,746
Should I screw your young wife...

899
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:54,125
...or visit your son,
the soccer player?

900
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,296
My daughter knows your son.

901
01:06:08,347 --> 01:06:11,893
- You're gonna regret this.
- I hope that we can remain friends.

902
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:15,396
Because at the end, what else
do we have but friendship, trust...

903
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:17,273
...honor.

904
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:23,196
Without this,
we are no more than beasts.

905
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,753
The kitchen monitor's out.

906
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,005
What the hell's going on out there?

907
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:45,927
Shit.

908
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,013
I found something.

909
01:06:53,768 --> 01:06:57,438
- It's a guy's finger.
- What, did the rats eat the rest of him?

910
01:06:58,439 --> 01:07:01,943
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, I was just looking for you.

911
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,153
I think I figured out your problem.

912
01:07:04,445 --> 01:07:06,280
Y'all a bunch of filthy motherfuckers.

913
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:09,784
Blow out!

914
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,161
- What's going on? Shit!
- Get out of the house!

915
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,876
This shit's got to stop.

916
01:07:27,385 --> 01:07:28,845
Fuck!

917
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,805
We should go.

918
01:07:34,433 --> 01:07:35,893
Go! Go!

919
01:07:36,102 --> 01:07:37,687
Just another day with Mike Lowrey.

920
01:07:44,569 --> 01:07:46,529
- Damn! Go!
- Come on!

921
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:57,206
Roberto thinks they were
the gangbangers...

922
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,333
...that tried to hijack the drop, boss.

923
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:04,046
How did this thing happen?

924
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:10,636
I don't know. We called the rat people
and these guys showed up.

925
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:12,680
Maybe you're the rat, huh?

926
01:08:13,431 --> 01:08:17,894
They tried to steal from me, and
you let them into my mother's house.

927
01:08:18,102 --> 01:08:20,146
Johnny. Hey, no.

928
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:22,106
I would never...

929
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:27,487
Nobody puts in danger
my daughter, my mother...

930
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,572
...or my money.

931
01:08:34,785 --> 01:08:37,038
Send him to the mortuary.

932
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,125
Johnny. Johnny,
what happened to Roberto?

933
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,794
He killed himself, Mama.

934
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:49,467
- Very sad.
- Write a nice letter to his mother.

935
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:51,093
I'll do it.

936
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,845
Okay. Bye.

937
01:08:54,806 --> 01:08:58,059
- Yo, run the print.
- Mike, stop playing, man!

938
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,895
- Run the print.
- Don't touch me with no dead finger.

939
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:05,775
Excuse me, run this print.
I need to find the owner.

940
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,401
Thank you.

941
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,029
Think you can find out
what's on these shreds?

942
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,572
Of course.

943
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:16,118
We're thinking about ordering lunch.

944
01:09:16,327 --> 01:09:20,289
Should we put you down for some extra
crispy and a couple of grape sodas?

945
01:09:21,082 --> 01:09:23,251
"Couple of grape sodas."

946
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,754
- Very funny. That's hilarious.
- Isn't it low tide?

947
01:09:27,004 --> 01:09:28,047
I think it is.

948
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,425
- Don't you have relatives to pick up?
- What?

949
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,804
Yo, now you crossed the line, man.
Okay, no, that's not funny.

950
01:09:35,012 --> 01:09:38,349
We're fucking with you. We planted
wires, we need some help. No bullshit.

951
01:09:41,227 --> 01:09:43,229
I want you...

952
01:09:47,191 --> 01:09:48,985
...to find out...

953
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:52,530
...who those two black
puta de mierda are.

954
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:56,826
And I want them lying right here...

955
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,372
...in Mama's garden
in these coffins!

956
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,751
And our mystery finger
belongs to:

957
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,129
Josef Kuninskavich.

958
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:10,923
He was a lieutenant in a Russian mob.

959
01:10:11,174 --> 01:10:13,676
Owned a couple dozen
Florida nightclubs.

960
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:16,387
Tapia's starting to knock off
Russian mob bosses.

961
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:20,266
Got something.

962
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:21,934
What you got, dickhead?

963
01:10:22,143 --> 01:10:24,770
The computer matches half tones,
gray tones, densities.

964
01:10:24,979 --> 01:10:27,440
Sort of like a visual code-breaking.

965
01:10:27,648 --> 01:10:29,609
Little something I put together.

966
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:34,405
The shredded papers was a photo.
Some kind of boat. "Dixie 7."

967
01:10:34,614 --> 01:10:35,656
Dixie 7.

968
01:10:36,157 --> 01:10:40,912
- It's registered to a one Floyd Poteet.
- The Poteet brothers.

969
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:45,833
One of the KKK guys we busted.
You blew his ear off, remember?

970
01:10:46,334 --> 01:10:48,461
Mike, can you teach me
how to shoot people?

971
01:10:49,754 --> 01:10:51,756
Listen to what we got at Tapia's.

972
01:10:59,263 --> 01:11:00,765
The second-in-command is talking.

973
01:11:00,973 --> 01:11:05,436
He's telling him, "Yes, boss. We
found a bunch of fat doe fuckers...

974
01:11:05,645 --> 01:11:08,564
...and we're getting them emptied."
- Fat does emptied?

975
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:11,943
- The hell does that mean?
- He has a meeting this afternoon.

976
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:16,280
- You know who I am?
- Name sounds familiar.

977
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:18,533
Sense of humor. I like that.

978
01:11:19,242 --> 01:11:22,078
Meet me on the sand,
2:00, Shore Club.

979
01:11:22,286 --> 01:11:25,790
- She has no idea. Let's roll.
- Y'all come with us.

980
01:11:35,005 --> 01:11:37,382
I ordered a couple
of Bacardi Mojitos.

981
01:11:42,596 --> 01:11:43,931
Miami.

982
01:11:44,973 --> 01:11:49,394
Okay, zoom in on nine.
A little more audio, please.

983
01:11:49,645 --> 01:11:52,773
So, why don't we take a swim?
Cool off.

984
01:11:54,233 --> 01:11:57,694
Or we could just stay here
and get drunk. How about that?

985
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:00,030
Or we could drink this later.

986
01:12:00,197 --> 01:12:02,032
Unless you have a reason...

987
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:06,078
...why you don't want to get
that beautiful body of yours wet.

988
01:12:07,371 --> 01:12:09,414
Why not just ask
if I'm wearing a wire?

989
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:13,043
I'd rather go swimming.

990
01:12:17,339 --> 01:12:19,716
- What the hell's he doing?
- Son of a bitch.

991
01:12:19,883 --> 01:12:22,427
Shit. He's taking her into the water.

992
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,400
This guy's smart.

993
01:12:37,526 --> 01:12:42,322
I want you to work for me. Why waste
time on this unnecessary talking?

994
01:12:42,573 --> 01:12:46,410
It's very unnecessary. What do
you need with another banker?

995
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,205
For the same reason
as your previous employer.

996
01:12:50,455 --> 01:12:54,209
But now I own all the Russian clubs.
No middleman.

997
01:12:54,418 --> 01:12:59,548
I'm about to be the biggest importer
and distributor of X in North America.

998
01:12:59,756 --> 01:13:03,886
You're gonna be a very rich young
woman. That's why I thought...

999
01:13:04,094 --> 01:13:06,722
I know what you thought, Mr. Tapia.

1000
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:09,433
As long as you don't think it
more than once...

1001
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,602
...I'm happy to be in business
with you.

1002
01:13:12,936 --> 01:13:14,730
All right.

1003
01:13:14,938 --> 01:13:16,732
Let's do business.

1004
01:13:28,243 --> 01:13:30,370
What are you,
a cop or a model?

1005
01:13:30,621 --> 01:13:34,082
What do you mean? I threw something
on. I like looking good. What?

1006
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:35,626
For who?

1007
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:38,086
Don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

1008
01:13:38,462 --> 01:13:39,838
I hate the tailor.

1009
01:13:41,798 --> 01:13:43,467
Good job. We'll get him.

1010
01:13:45,802 --> 01:13:48,305
Your brother would love to talk
to you down the street.

1011
01:13:48,514 --> 01:13:50,307
Whoa, what's going on?

1012
01:13:54,978 --> 01:13:56,939
You trying to blow my case
or you just insane?

1013
01:13:57,147 --> 01:13:59,608
You're the one taking a dip
with the Cubano maniac.

1014
01:14:01,568 --> 01:14:03,779
- How'd you know that?
- We had a wire in the house.

1015
01:14:04,404 --> 01:14:07,741
- You two have a warrant for that wire?
- Look, fuck that, okay?

1016
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,702
You don't know the kind of danger
that you're in, Syd.

1017
01:14:10,911 --> 01:14:15,207
I am fully aware and I am fully capable
of what I am doing.

1018
01:14:15,415 --> 01:14:17,042
I am not your baby sister anymore.

1019
01:14:17,251 --> 01:14:19,253
For the DEA you ain't nothing
but a honeypot.

1020
01:14:19,461 --> 01:14:20,546
What'd you just say?

1021
01:14:20,754 --> 01:14:24,424
That's why you got the job, because
you look good in a bathing suit.

1022
01:14:24,675 --> 01:14:27,177
All right, let's sit down somewhere.

1023
01:14:29,721 --> 01:14:33,016
All right, look, Syd, there's
some shit you need to know.

1024
01:14:33,183 --> 01:14:36,645
Johnny Tapia is cutting up Russian
mob bosses in his mom's kitchen.

1025
01:14:37,145 --> 01:14:38,272
In the kitchen, Syd.

1026
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,649
He found a severed finger
by the crock pot.

1027
01:14:40,899 --> 01:14:43,569
You're about to be in the middle
of a drug war.

1028
01:14:44,194 --> 01:14:48,156
Miami PD has arrested this guy
12 times with no convictions.

1029
01:14:48,365 --> 01:14:50,909
Why don't you just hang back
and let us bring him down?

1030
01:14:51,076 --> 01:14:53,662
Guys, look, I need this, okay?
And I am this close.

1031
01:14:53,912 --> 01:14:54,913
What's "this close"?

1032
01:14:55,205 --> 01:14:57,833
I'm in charge of money laundering
for his entire operation.

1033
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:01,503
In a month or two we'll have enough
for a conviction and it'll be over.

1034
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:03,255
What about a day or two?
Sound better?

1035
01:15:03,505 --> 01:15:06,758
Marcus and I think we found the key
to Tapia's whole operation.

1036
01:15:06,967 --> 01:15:08,677
You have nothing to say now, huh?

1037
01:15:08,886 --> 01:15:12,848
- Just stuck, right?
- Okay, time-out, y'all. Damn.

1038
01:15:13,056 --> 01:15:14,933
We got this peckerwood
that'll put us down...

1039
01:15:15,142 --> 01:15:18,687
...with the transport end of Tapia's
operation. Do you want in?

1040
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:19,855
- Why would you...?
- When?

1041
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:21,481
- Tonight.
- Page me.

1042
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:23,567
Should I bring my thong?

1043
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:28,697
Get your bitch hands off.
I'll knock you the fuck out.

1044
01:15:30,032 --> 01:15:32,993
Mike, we're trying to keep her
out of trouble, man...

1045
01:15:33,202 --> 01:15:34,870
...not invite her in.

1046
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:37,706
Man, I just figured, you know,
if she with us...

1047
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:40,751
...that's just less trouble
she could get into.

1048
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:45,380
I'm gonna keep it real with you too,
man. I think she can handle herself.

1049
01:15:45,589 --> 01:15:48,926
I'm gonna keep it real with you.
Don't nobody know my sister like I do.

1050
01:15:49,134 --> 01:15:52,221
Okay? She doesn't
make good choices, Mike.

1051
01:15:52,429 --> 01:15:55,265
- She's not street-smart.
- Doesn't make good...?

1052
01:15:55,432 --> 01:15:57,559
- Like, what kind of choices?
- Men, for one.

1053
01:15:58,268 --> 01:16:00,521
She's attracted to these dumb...

1054
01:16:00,771 --> 01:16:05,067
...flashy, just musclebound dickheads,
Mike. You know?

1055
01:16:05,317 --> 01:16:11,073
Cock diesel motherfuckers that can't
even fucking turn to wipe their ass.

1056
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:12,783
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

1057
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:16,411
You know? Just dumb
as a bucket of shrimp.

1058
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:20,082
Yeah. Yeah. That shit's crazy.

1059
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:22,876
I mean, you don't think maybe you...

1060
01:16:23,085 --> 01:16:26,004
Maybe you didn't, like,
get a chance to know any of them?

1061
01:16:26,213 --> 01:16:28,173
I'm gonna give the next one
a chance.

1062
01:16:28,382 --> 01:16:31,301
A chance to whup his ass.

1063
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,930
- Whup the shit out of him.
- Oh, you gonna fight him?

1064
01:16:35,138 --> 01:16:37,641
What I'm gonna do
ain't even gonna be legal.

1065
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:40,561
I might be up in here
with these motherfuckers.

1066
01:16:40,894 --> 01:16:42,896
Do you know what I mean?

1067
01:16:44,147 --> 01:16:45,649
The fuck you looking at?

1068
01:16:45,983 --> 01:16:46,149
Thank you kindly.

1069
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:47,943
Thank you kindly.

1070
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:51,488
- Who sprung me?
- Hey, Cousin Floyd.

1071
01:16:51,655 --> 01:16:52,990
- Oh, you.
- Remember me?

1072
01:16:57,452 --> 01:16:58,912
Cheese.

1073
01:16:59,746 --> 01:17:01,039
Y'all look great together.

1074
01:17:01,248 --> 01:17:03,458
- What the fuck you doing?
- Just a little insurance.

1075
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,460
You gonna help us find Dixie 7...

1076
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:08,130
...and tell us what that boat
has to do with Johnny Tapia.

1077
01:17:08,338 --> 01:17:11,175
- I ain't no snitch.
- Oh, you ain't no snitch?

1078
01:17:11,425 --> 01:17:15,220
- Oh, damn. That's a shame.
- Know what I'm gonna do?

1079
01:17:15,429 --> 01:17:20,309
I'm gonna send a special 8 x 10
to his KKK buddies back in jail.

1080
01:17:20,517 --> 01:17:22,394
You know what,
it's a digital photo too.

1081
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:25,314
So we can do
whatever we want to do with it.

1082
01:17:25,522 --> 01:17:27,107
By the time we get done with you...

1083
01:17:27,274 --> 01:17:29,735
...you gonna be in the next
Busta Rhymes video on BET.

1084
01:17:29,943 --> 01:17:31,528
Tuck ass.

1085
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:34,740
I got my rights.

1086
01:17:35,532 --> 01:17:38,327
I'm worried. There's too much heat
around in Miami.

1087
01:17:38,535 --> 01:17:41,371
I can feel it. I can feel it.

1088
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:46,460
We need to put my money in coffins
to Cuba faster.

1089
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:49,796
You should tell the mortuary
to speed things up. All right?

1090
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:01,266
That's the channel marker
way out there.

1091
01:18:01,475 --> 01:18:06,188
They make the drop mostly at dawn,
but there'll be one today, though.

1092
01:18:11,276 --> 01:18:14,530
Syd, you talk to Mama?
She's got hives.

1093
01:18:15,822 --> 01:18:18,367
Oh, and I told Mama
about your Cubano boyfriend.

1094
01:18:18,575 --> 01:18:20,244
He ain't invited to Christmas dinner.

1095
01:18:20,494 --> 01:18:23,455
Change the station.
More music, less Marcus.

1096
01:18:23,705 --> 01:18:28,585
If you open the door he'll be a black
Dr. Phil for the next 40 minutes.

1097
01:18:30,504 --> 01:18:32,923
Syd, you might not want to get
too flirty with Mike.

1098
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:36,093
Your boyfriend might cut off
his trigger finger.

1099
01:18:37,553 --> 01:18:40,889
Maybe Mike's been flirting with me.
Did you ever think about that?

1100
01:18:43,892 --> 01:18:44,893
Trigger Mike?

1101
01:18:45,102 --> 01:18:47,187
Not like this. Don't play
with that boy.

1102
01:18:47,396 --> 01:18:50,566
- Seriously. Don't play with that boy.
- Just tell him about New York.

1103
01:18:50,774 --> 01:18:52,401
- Do it.
- Tell me what?

1104
01:18:52,651 --> 01:18:54,695
Oh, shit. Is he walking
down the steps?

1105
01:18:55,404 --> 01:18:57,906
Oh, shit. He coming down.

1106
01:18:58,156 --> 01:19:00,826
- It's okay.
- Yeah, you done fucked up.

1107
01:19:01,118 --> 01:19:03,078
You done fucked up.

1108
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,956
You remember...

1109
01:19:06,123 --> 01:19:07,958
Remember I went to New York?
You remember?

1110
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,085
And...

1111
01:19:10,294 --> 01:19:11,920
...I said, "Syd."

1112
01:19:12,254 --> 01:19:13,589
I ran in...

1113
01:19:14,006 --> 01:19:17,301
Syd ran into me in New York
on the street in that place.

1114
01:19:17,509 --> 01:19:19,428
And I said:

1115
01:19:19,845 --> 01:19:20,929
"What's up?"

1116
01:19:21,346 --> 01:19:23,932
And we was hungry, so then...

1117
01:19:24,725 --> 01:19:26,518
...she had fish.

1118
01:19:27,811 --> 01:19:29,605
It was grouper.

1119
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:32,608
And then I had some chicken.

1120
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,777
Remember I was supposed
to come home?

1121
01:19:35,944 --> 01:19:37,487
But I didn't.

1122
01:19:37,946 --> 01:19:39,823
We went out on a date.

1123
01:19:40,574 --> 01:19:43,785
Five, actually.
Now we're seeing each other.

1124
01:19:45,662 --> 01:19:46,622
Hold up.

1125
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:50,751
You know, really out of respect
for you, Marcus, nothing happened.

1126
01:19:52,085 --> 01:19:54,004
Hey, Mike, why you tripping, man?

1127
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:56,548
I mean, we wanted to make sure
you was cool with it.

1128
01:19:56,757 --> 01:20:00,469
Doesn't matter what I think, you know.
Hey, I had to find out like this, right?

1129
01:20:00,969 --> 01:20:01,929
Don't matter.

1130
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:06,141
Let me ask you, y'all gonna have
babies? Little bunch of mini Mikes?

1131
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,352
Bunch of little lying, violent
motherfuckers?

1132
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,354
Marcus, nothing happened.

1133
01:20:10,562 --> 01:20:12,689
I just want to say,
Mama's gonna be thrilled.

1134
01:20:12,856 --> 01:20:16,151
All right, you know what, you need to
"whoosah" or something for a second.

1135
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,278
Hey, here comes the Dixie 7.

1136
01:20:19,488 --> 01:20:20,864
Whoosah.

1137
01:20:22,991 --> 01:20:24,034
Just leave it alone.

1138
01:20:24,243 --> 01:20:27,204
- Why you acting like that?
- Go on about your business, man.

1139
01:20:27,371 --> 01:20:29,790
- We gonna talk about this.
- No. Get out of my face.

1140
01:20:29,998 --> 01:20:33,001
- I'm trying to talk to you.
- Get the fuck off me, Mike.

1141
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:37,005
What the hell is your problem, man?!
Why you acting so stupid?!

1142
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:40,300
This is a dysfunctional partnership.
That's why I'm acting like that.

1143
01:20:40,551 --> 01:20:41,927
- You know...
- There ain't no trust.

1144
01:20:42,135 --> 01:20:43,387
I didn't lie to you!

1145
01:20:43,595 --> 01:20:46,849
I was waiting for the right time
to tell you. But that ain't your issue.

1146
01:20:47,015 --> 01:20:50,269
Why don't you bring it to me real.
What is your problem with this?!

1147
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:53,313
You know what? You a dog, man.

1148
01:20:53,522 --> 01:20:56,525
- That's it. There it is. I said it.
- Oh, okay.

1149
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,028
You like a pit bull with that little
pink thing hanging out.

1150
01:21:01,488 --> 01:21:03,991
Oh, it's like that.
Oh, okay.

1151
01:21:04,575 --> 01:21:07,870
I'm not good enough for your sister.

1152
01:21:09,246 --> 01:21:11,415
Guys, enough. The boat's coming.

1153
01:21:12,332 --> 01:21:16,378
Okay. We gonna handle that shit.
Go ahead, man.

1154
01:21:20,257 --> 01:21:22,634
In about an hour,
the drop boat's gonna come.

1155
01:21:38,692 --> 01:21:40,611
We got them.

1156
01:21:42,946 --> 01:21:45,073
Wonder what mortuary
that coffin's going to.

1157
01:21:58,128 --> 01:21:59,755
Keep going straight by.

1158
01:22:05,552 --> 01:22:07,596
You seeing what I'm seeing?

1159
01:22:12,809 --> 01:22:16,396
Get the load to the mortuary
and don't screw up.

1160
01:22:16,647 --> 01:22:17,814
I got it.

1161
01:22:18,649 --> 01:22:19,608
Load up.

1162
01:22:31,995 --> 01:22:32,996
They're getting away!

1163
01:22:33,163 --> 01:22:34,706
Stop! Stop!

1164
01:22:35,374 --> 01:22:36,834
We need your car. All right?

1165
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,628
- Get out the car.
- Can't you get a better car than that?

1166
01:22:40,796 --> 01:22:41,797
Let that man go!

1167
01:22:42,089 --> 01:22:44,800
- Don't be coming at me with that tone.
- Freak.

1168
01:22:45,092 --> 01:22:48,303
- Small cars don't hurt the ozone layer.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1169
01:22:48,512 --> 01:22:50,180
- Stop the car.
- Get... Yeah.

1170
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:53,267
- Pop the trunk. Get out. Get in.
- Get out. Get out.

1171
01:22:53,517 --> 01:22:55,477
- Get your ass in.
- Okay.

1172
01:22:56,019 --> 01:22:58,647
- I am in the middle of a sale.
- Do I have to pull my gun?

1173
01:22:58,856 --> 01:23:02,651
Oh, shit. Dan Marino. What's up?
Back up, Dan. Hey, you're the truth.

1174
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:05,070
- Whatever you need, officers.
- That's Dan Marino.

1175
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:07,781
- Hey. Back up.
- Let me know how it rides.

1176
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,158
He's gonna test-drive the shit
out this.

1177
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:12,035
Go. I don't want to blow my cover.

1178
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,834
Got them. Got them right there.

1179
01:23:33,265 --> 01:23:34,725
Why you gotta get so close?

1180
01:23:34,933 --> 01:23:37,811
- I won't let that coffin get away.
- But they're all around us.

1181
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:39,521
Shit, those are the gangbangers.

1182
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:41,565
Relax, they don't know us.

1183
01:23:42,524 --> 01:23:44,693
Boss, we got a problem here.
We're being followed.

1184
01:23:45,527 --> 01:23:47,404
This is a big problem, Carlos.

1185
01:23:47,613 --> 01:23:52,868
- Sorry, boss. I'll take care of it, okay?
- Kill those black bitches. All right?!

1186
01:23:53,243 --> 01:23:55,579
They made us. Get some
undercovers to roll with us.

1187
01:23:55,996 --> 01:23:59,333
We're splitting up. Everybody
go to Third and Boxter, now!

1188
01:24:02,419 --> 01:24:03,420
Here we go.

1189
01:24:13,847 --> 01:24:16,517
I didn't sign up for no
goddamned car chase!

1190
01:24:30,113 --> 01:24:31,365
Have you lost your mind?

1191
01:24:35,661 --> 01:24:39,748
I see you got your mind set on doing
dumb shit, so please let me out!

1192
01:24:48,841 --> 01:24:51,426
I seen this in a movie once.
They didn't make it!

1193
01:24:54,805 --> 01:24:55,764
Oh, shit!

1194
01:25:04,481 --> 01:25:05,732
- Dump truck!
- I got it.

1195
01:25:07,401 --> 01:25:09,570
- Mike!
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1196
01:25:14,324 --> 01:25:16,118
Right there! Oh, shit, Mike!

1197
01:25:16,326 --> 01:25:18,412
- Did you see that shit?
- No shit.

1198
01:25:27,546 --> 01:25:29,464
Dan Marino should definitely
buy this car.

1199
01:25:30,841 --> 01:25:34,052
Not this one. I'm fucking this one up.
But definitely one like this.

1200
01:25:36,054 --> 01:25:37,139
I almost missed that.

1201
01:25:39,349 --> 01:25:41,977
All right, that was almost fucked up.
I almost fucked up.

1202
01:25:44,313 --> 01:25:45,480
Shit!

1203
01:25:47,191 --> 01:25:48,400
This is not necessary.

1204
01:25:57,868 --> 01:25:59,411
Oh, shit!

1205
01:26:03,207 --> 01:26:05,626
- Damn!
- Dead man on the hood! Dead man!

1206
01:26:05,834 --> 01:26:07,503
- I'm trying to get it off.
- Get it off!

1207
01:26:07,711 --> 01:26:08,837
I'm trying to get it off.

1208
01:26:10,631 --> 01:26:12,925
- That shit's nasty. That's nasty.
- Get it off! Get...

1209
01:26:13,133 --> 01:26:14,551
That shit is nasty.

1210
01:26:34,988 --> 01:26:37,741
- Undercover police! Everybody move!
- Undercover police!

1211
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:40,536
- Move!
- Move! Move! Move!

1212
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:52,881
Coming around the corner!

1213
01:26:53,298 --> 01:26:55,801
Get ready, they're coming
around the block. Move!

1214
01:27:11,441 --> 01:27:12,568
Up top!

1215
01:27:20,367 --> 01:27:21,493
Shit!

1216
01:27:21,702 --> 01:27:24,413
Boy, if this was my car,
I'd be pissed!

1217
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:26,290
Get down! Get down!

1218
01:27:31,128 --> 01:27:33,881
Trying to break the world record
for gun fights in a week!?

1219
01:27:34,089 --> 01:27:36,091
This is not the time to criticize!

1220
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,510
I can't work with you
blaming me all the time!

1221
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:42,181
- This is not your fault?
- This is not... No! No!

1222
01:27:42,347 --> 01:27:45,142
Bullshit, Mike!
Everything's your fault!

1223
01:27:53,692 --> 01:27:55,152
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

1224
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:06,038
- Clear around!
- Cool!

1225
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:12,169
I'm going around!

1226
01:28:16,423 --> 01:28:18,717
- Mike, got him!
- They got the coffin.

1227
01:28:30,729 --> 01:28:31,730
Move!

1228
01:28:32,314 --> 01:28:34,525
Move! Move! Get down!
Police! Get down!

1229
01:28:40,906 --> 01:28:41,990
Move! Move!

1230
01:28:43,283 --> 01:28:44,952
Police! Move! Move!

1231
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,829
Get out of my way! Move! Move!

1232
01:28:46,995 --> 01:28:48,372
Get down! Get down!

1233
01:28:53,919 --> 01:28:56,839
Shit! Open the door! Police!

1234
01:28:58,048 --> 01:28:59,383
No!

1235
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:02,135
Whoa! Shit!

1236
01:29:03,387 --> 01:29:05,389
Mike! Mike!

1237
01:29:19,278 --> 01:29:20,821
That boy bit me!

1238
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:26,410
Mike!

1239
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:43,260
Move! Move!

1240
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:47,598
Police! Move!

1241
01:30:03,655 --> 01:30:05,115
Police! Move!

1242
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:10,621
He under there?

1243
01:30:11,955 --> 01:30:13,499
We lost the coffin...

1244
01:30:13,957 --> 01:30:16,585
...and you barbecued
our only lead, Mike.

1245
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,923
This has got to be the worst, most
emotional cop week of my life.

1246
01:30:21,882 --> 01:30:23,634
Yeah, it's been a little rough.

1247
01:30:29,389 --> 01:30:33,352
- Where were these bodies going?
- I don't know. It's really strange.

1248
01:30:33,602 --> 01:30:35,687
All the John Does we found
out here are empty.

1249
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:38,482
Empty Does. Fat Does.

1250
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:41,693
Cut them open, took the organs out.
Sewed them back up.

1251
01:30:42,861 --> 01:30:43,987
Nice work.

1252
01:30:44,196 --> 01:30:47,115
The more you guys fuck up,
the more we look like rock stars.

1253
01:30:47,324 --> 01:30:49,910
The van you was chasing
is a transport for the city morgue.

1254
01:30:50,118 --> 01:30:53,956
The John Does were being delivered
to the university for medical research.

1255
01:30:54,164 --> 01:30:56,291
- Nice going.
- I can't believe you guys.

1256
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,127
Do you both wake up
in the morning, call each other up?

1257
01:30:59,336 --> 01:31:01,088
"Good morning, Marcus."
"Morning, Mike."

1258
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,506
"How you doing?"
"A'ight."

1259
01:31:02,756 --> 01:31:05,676
"So how are we gonna fuck up
the captain's life today?"

1260
01:31:05,843 --> 01:31:07,469
"Gee, I don't know."
"I don't know."

1261
01:31:07,719 --> 01:31:09,847
"Ooh. Look, over there.

1262
01:31:10,055 --> 01:31:12,808
Let's kill three fat people...

1263
01:31:13,016 --> 01:31:15,185
...and leave them on the street."

1264
01:31:15,352 --> 01:31:17,187
They were dead
before we ran over them.

1265
01:31:17,354 --> 01:31:21,358
It doesn't matter whether they
were dead or not, goddamn it!

1266
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:24,528
Every time you leave a corpse
on the street...

1267
01:31:24,695 --> 01:31:29,783
...I have to get these forensic coroner
guys to come to see what happened.

1268
01:31:29,992 --> 01:31:33,620
Then I gotta get detectives.
See? They're detecting shit.

1269
01:31:33,829 --> 01:31:39,084
Then I gotta get these forensic guys
to stick them back in the fucking bag!

1270
01:31:39,251 --> 01:31:41,378
Jesus Christ!

1271
01:31:41,712 --> 01:31:43,672
You guys, you're like...

1272
01:31:44,089 --> 01:31:47,342
You're like a bunch
of bloodsucking ticks...

1273
01:31:47,718 --> 01:31:50,846
...draining the life's blood
out of this department.

1274
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,265
- Whoosah.
- Damn the whoosah, captain.

1275
01:31:53,432 --> 01:31:56,101
- Did you just call me a tick?
- I was referring to him.

1276
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,061
- Thought so.
- These aren't normal corpses.

1277
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:01,440
If I threw you out
of a speeding ice truck...

1278
01:32:01,648 --> 01:32:04,693
...and then ran over your head,
you wouldn't be normal either.

1279
01:32:04,902 --> 01:32:07,863
Think about this for a second.
These bodies have been emptied...

1280
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:11,074
...from a drug smuggler that just
happens to own a mortuary.

1281
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:14,161
I got a bunch of bodies waiting
with plenty of room in them...

1282
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:15,871
...I could smuggle some shit.

1283
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:19,249
- Johnny Tapia has the perfect cover.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1284
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,168
Johnny Tapia?

1285
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,795
I want a warrant to go
into his mortuaries immediately.

1286
01:32:24,004 --> 01:32:25,923
No warrant. What?
For what? For what?

1287
01:32:26,089 --> 01:32:28,800
For a bunch of dead guys
on their way to med research?

1288
01:32:29,009 --> 01:32:33,889
No. Every time we go after him,
he sues us and wins.

1289
01:32:34,097 --> 01:32:38,143
This shit stops now
or they'll fire us, disband TNT...

1290
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:40,354
...and stick me in a fucking coffin.

1291
01:32:40,604 --> 01:32:43,690
- This is over now!
- What happened to "whatever it takes"?

1292
01:32:43,899 --> 01:32:47,861
That was pre-vehicular manslaughter.
Not to mention Johnny Tapia...

1293
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:50,489
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh, shit.

1294
01:32:54,827 --> 01:32:58,288
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.

1295
01:32:58,497 --> 01:33:00,999
This man has violated my rights!

1296
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:02,584
Who the fuck is that?

1297
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,630
Running people over is not enough
for you? Now you're into kidnapping?

1298
01:33:06,839 --> 01:33:09,132
That man is a criminal. Okay?
We busted him at the...

1299
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:11,468
Excuse me, I have so much brass
up my ass...

1300
01:33:11,677 --> 01:33:14,137
...I could be playing
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

1301
01:33:15,681 --> 01:33:17,474
I ain't cut out for this, man.

1302
01:33:17,933 --> 01:33:20,018
Come on, man. I can't do this
with you right now.

1303
01:33:20,269 --> 01:33:24,231
- I'm re-evaluating what's important.
- About what? Being a cop?

1304
01:33:24,481 --> 01:33:26,233
No, about you being my partner.

1305
01:33:26,483 --> 01:33:29,528
Is this about Syd?
God! Hey, Marcus, man...

1306
01:33:29,736 --> 01:33:32,656
That was messed up, but that
ain't what this is about, Mike.

1307
01:33:32,823 --> 01:33:36,743
Once we nail Tapia,
you and me, we're over.

1308
01:33:36,952 --> 01:33:38,954
I already signed my transfer papers.

1309
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:49,298
Megan, what's the name of this boy
taking you to the movies?

1310
01:33:49,506 --> 01:33:50,549
Reggie.

1311
01:33:50,799 --> 01:33:53,886
Daddy, please don't embarrass me
and ask him a lot of questions.

1312
01:33:54,136 --> 01:33:56,805
Everybody knows you're a cop,
and it makes people nervous.

1313
01:33:57,014 --> 01:33:59,600
Well, why nervous? He on crack?

1314
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:05,230
- It's cool?
- Yeah. Come in.

1315
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:06,899
What'd you...?

1316
01:34:07,524 --> 01:34:08,984
I got a sneak and peek.

1317
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:11,862
Judge Sinclair said we can go
into the mortuary tonight.

1318
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:14,281
We can't touch nothing,
but if we find something...

1319
01:34:14,489 --> 01:34:16,116
...he'll give us a righteous warrant.

1320
01:34:16,325 --> 01:34:18,494
You love pissing Captain Howard off,
don't you?

1321
01:34:19,077 --> 01:34:20,245
It's what I do.

1322
01:34:20,996 --> 01:34:23,123
So when you start playing golf?

1323
01:34:23,749 --> 01:34:27,711
Hey, so you real serious about
this transfer thing, huh?

1324
01:34:27,961 --> 01:34:31,507
I mean, you been quitting for 10 years.
I just always thought it was...

1325
01:34:31,715 --> 01:34:33,342
...how you dealt with all this shit.

1326
01:34:33,717 --> 01:34:36,261
It's what's best for me and my family.

1327
01:34:39,056 --> 01:34:41,183
Look, I'm gonna get my stuff, man.

1328
01:35:03,914 --> 01:35:07,042
"We ride together,
we die together.

1329
01:35:07,543 --> 01:35:09,211
Bad boys for life."

1330
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:11,505
We getting old, Mike.

1331
01:35:11,964 --> 01:35:15,133
One of them young punks coming
to take my baby out on her first date.

1332
01:35:19,471 --> 01:35:22,140
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hi, Mr. Burnett. I'm Reggie.

1333
01:35:22,808 --> 01:35:24,935
- What you doing here?
- I came to take out Megan.

1334
01:35:25,143 --> 01:35:27,437
- What?!
- I came to take out Megan.

1335
01:35:27,646 --> 01:35:29,648
- How old are you?
- I'm 15, Mr. Burnett.

1336
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:31,567
Motherfucker, you look 30.

1337
01:35:32,442 --> 01:35:34,361
- Show me some ID.
- I don't have none on me.

1338
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:37,489
You don't have no ID.
Get your ass up against that wall.

1339
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:38,824
What is your problem?

1340
01:35:39,032 --> 01:35:41,827
You think you know it all.
Little young Thundercats.

1341
01:35:42,035 --> 01:35:43,162
- Got joints on you?
- No.

1342
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:44,913
- You smoke that shit?
- No, sir.

1343
01:35:45,122 --> 01:35:47,708
You trying to get my daughter high?
Do you smoke that shit?

1344
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,918
- Nigga, who that is at the door?
- It's Reggie.

1345
01:35:50,294 --> 01:35:53,297
- Who the fuck is Reggie?
- Came to take Megan out.

1346
01:35:54,214 --> 01:35:56,925
- What you want, nigga?
- I'm here to take his daughter out.

1347
01:35:57,134 --> 01:35:58,468
- What's your name?
- Reggie.

1348
01:35:58,635 --> 01:36:00,637
I heard the motherfucker
say your name Reggie.

1349
01:36:00,846 --> 01:36:01,930
You taking Megan out?

1350
01:36:02,139 --> 01:36:03,515
- How old is you?
- Fifteen.

1351
01:36:03,724 --> 01:36:05,767
- Shit, nigga, you at least 30.
- This is Mike.

1352
01:36:06,018 --> 01:36:07,311
- Can you fight?
- Yeah.

1353
01:36:07,561 --> 01:36:10,564
You can fight? Motherfucker.
You can't fight. Look at you...

1354
01:36:10,814 --> 01:36:12,649
- Cut it out.
- I want to know if...

1355
01:36:12,858 --> 01:36:15,819
When somebody taking my niece out,
I want to know if he can fight.

1356
01:36:16,028 --> 01:36:19,239
Somebody might come say something,
the nigga can't fight, she can't go.

1357
01:36:19,406 --> 01:36:22,075
This is Megan's godfather, okay?
He just got out the joint.

1358
01:36:22,284 --> 01:36:24,661
Why you putting all my business
in the street?

1359
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:27,956
- They call him...
- I got out of jail. I ain't going back!

1360
01:36:28,165 --> 01:36:29,333
I ain't going back!

1361
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:32,878
What's wrong with you? You're
scared. You ain't seen a gun before?

1362
01:36:33,086 --> 01:36:34,546
Stop pointing the gun
at the boy.

1363
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:37,382
Look, don't you disrespect me
in front of company.

1364
01:36:37,633 --> 01:36:38,717
Let the gun go off.

1365
01:36:38,967 --> 01:36:42,554
Nigga, you a big, tall, Ludacris-looking
motherfucker, ain't you?

1366
01:36:42,721 --> 01:36:43,680
- You rap?
- No.

1367
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,646
Hey, Mike!

1368
01:36:51,313 --> 01:36:53,982
Now, listen. Have my daughter
home at 10:01.

1369
01:36:54,191 --> 01:36:57,110
If she ain't home at 10:01,
I'm in the car, okay?

1370
01:36:57,319 --> 01:37:00,322
Lock, loaded and hunting
your motherfucking ass down.

1371
01:37:00,531 --> 01:37:02,783
- Do you hear me? Speak up.
- I'll go with him.

1372
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:05,953
If I'm there, know what it'll be?
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, nigga.

1373
01:37:06,161 --> 01:37:07,746
- That's what it'll be.
- Marcus!

1374
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:12,000
Reggie, baby, I am so sorry. Forgive
Megan's dad and his silly friend.

1375
01:37:12,209 --> 01:37:13,335
- You a virgin?
- Yes.

1376
01:37:13,585 --> 01:37:15,921
Keep it that way. Ain't gonna be
no fucking tonight.

1377
01:37:16,171 --> 01:37:18,882
Baby, the red shirt's nice.
You guys have a good time.

1378
01:37:19,091 --> 01:37:20,843
- You ever made love to a man?
- No.

1379
01:37:21,176 --> 01:37:22,719
- You want to?
- No, sir.

1380
01:37:23,095 --> 01:37:25,514
- Hey, have a good time, baby.
- Go. Go.

1381
01:37:25,722 --> 01:37:28,016
- All right.
- I need to go.

1382
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,477
That was cool.

1383
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:32,521
So you ready to bust this case open?

1384
01:37:32,729 --> 01:37:34,940
Oh, yeah. Let's finish strong.
All right?

1385
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:48,954
All right, ladies. We cannot take
a burn tonight or Tapia walks.

1386
01:37:49,204 --> 01:37:51,540
I need a good, clean break-in.

1387
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,877
- Zank, eyeball.
- Eyeball set.

1388
01:37:55,085 --> 01:37:57,421
- Dex, high ground.
- Rooftop set.

1389
01:37:57,629 --> 01:38:00,090
- Fanuti, light your crack pipe.
- Got you.

1390
01:38:00,549 --> 01:38:01,592
Lockman, you buzzing?

1391
01:38:02,926 --> 01:38:03,886
We're up, baby.

1392
01:38:14,062 --> 01:38:16,732
- Hello, anybody home?!
- We got a stiff to deliver!

1393
01:38:19,818 --> 01:38:22,821
- What's going on here, man?
- We got a stiff to deliver.

1394
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:26,200
- Nobody told me about any stiff.
- The guy's in the van now. He's fresh.

1395
01:38:26,408 --> 01:38:27,659
No deliveries tonight.

1396
01:38:32,831 --> 01:38:36,084
They told us to come right over
to the place. This is the place.

1397
01:38:37,252 --> 01:38:39,713
- We must bring him in here. I'm sorry.
- No one in.

1398
01:38:39,963 --> 01:38:42,341
- You get that body to the morgue yet?
- Morgue?

1399
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:44,801
You said to get it to
the Spanish Palms Mortuary.

1400
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:46,470
No, you dumb Latin fuck.

1401
01:38:46,678 --> 01:38:48,305
What you smoking
in that crack pipe?

1402
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:50,224
Who you calling a Latin fuck, man?

1403
01:38:54,311 --> 01:38:55,771
Check.

1404
01:38:55,854 --> 01:38:57,814
There's burnt people down here, Mike.

1405
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:01,068
Oh, fuck.

1406
01:39:03,278 --> 01:39:05,322
Damn, somebody's teeth.

1407
01:39:05,656 --> 01:39:08,242
Now that we're here, you need
to sign some paperwork...

1408
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:12,246
...because the man is very contagious.
His contagiousness could touch you.

1409
01:39:12,454 --> 01:39:14,289
You guys have a nice evening.
Good night.

1410
01:39:14,498 --> 01:39:17,209
Might you see us inside
for some hot cocoa?

1411
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:47,990
Cam one, I got a good signal.
Cam two, I got a good signal.

1412
01:40:02,796 --> 01:40:05,340
- Damn!
- Stop it. Do not do that tonight.

1413
01:40:05,549 --> 01:40:07,551
- You don't smell that?
- Oh, yeah, I smell it.

1414
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:09,511
- It stinks.
- Stop!

1415
01:40:11,513 --> 01:40:13,640
I'm gonna have some Pepto.

1416
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:24,776
- This dude hasn't been embalmed yet.
- What you talking about?

1417
01:40:24,985 --> 01:40:29,406
They stick a tube down your throat
and just suck out all the gunk and bile.

1418
01:40:29,573 --> 01:40:32,993
Because what happens is, your body'll
get gaseous and you'll decompose.

1419
01:40:33,202 --> 01:40:35,496
Don't want that to happen
before your family see you.

1420
01:40:35,746 --> 01:40:38,540
- I don't need to know that now.
- They sew your mouth closed.

1421
01:40:38,749 --> 01:40:41,919
They got to get it all out because
a lot of times dead people'll fart.

1422
01:40:42,544 --> 01:40:44,505
That shit'll clear a funeral home out.

1423
01:40:44,796 --> 01:40:48,467
- How do you know all that?
- Learning Channel. That shit got me.

1424
01:40:51,553 --> 01:40:53,055
Oh, shit.

1425
01:40:58,435 --> 01:41:00,312
You're not even gonna
warm up to it?

1426
01:41:00,562 --> 01:41:02,814
Hey! Do some cop work.

1427
01:41:03,273 --> 01:41:05,901
- He's a human being.
- Check the casket.

1428
01:41:06,151 --> 01:41:08,862
Why don't you check his spine
while you're in there.

1429
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:12,950
I'm retching.

1430
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:20,290
Mike!

1431
01:41:20,457 --> 01:41:22,417
- What?
- Have some dignity.

1432
01:41:22,626 --> 01:41:24,753
- I ain't doing nothing.
- Cover her titties up.

1433
01:41:24,962 --> 01:41:28,590
Like, what am I gonna do
with these big-ass dead titties?

1434
01:41:28,799 --> 01:41:30,092
But you're looking, though.

1435
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:32,678
There's... Something's wrong
with your brain.

1436
01:41:32,886 --> 01:41:34,096
Just cover the titties.

1437
01:41:34,471 --> 01:41:36,473
Goddamn!

1438
01:41:37,891 --> 01:41:40,602
Damn. This nicer than some cribs.

1439
01:41:41,311 --> 01:41:42,980
She's going to Cuba.

1440
01:41:46,608 --> 01:41:48,819
Who's top cop now? Huh?

1441
01:41:49,027 --> 01:41:51,280
That's what I'm talking about. See?
There you go.

1442
01:41:51,822 --> 01:41:55,033
That's it right there. Take a picture
of the money, then check this body.

1443
01:41:55,993 --> 01:41:57,995
Nah, I'm gonna count these.
You know?

1444
01:41:58,203 --> 01:41:59,204
Check the body.

1445
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:03,208
I'm gonna check the body, Mike.
I'm not rushing into it, that's all.

1446
01:42:04,877 --> 01:42:07,045
This one's going to a mortuary
in L.A.

1447
01:42:08,755 --> 01:42:11,216
I'm gonna check this one.

1448
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:36,950
That's that bullshit
that I be talking about.

1449
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:39,328
Mike, the motherfucking head fell off.

1450
01:42:39,786 --> 01:42:41,455
Come here.

1451
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:46,001
I'm back in the game.

1452
01:42:49,588 --> 01:42:51,173
Think I got something.

1453
01:42:52,508 --> 01:42:53,842
Feels like a bag.

1454
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:56,428
Shit, it's his kidney.

1455
01:43:06,021 --> 01:43:07,856
I smell dead people.

1456
01:43:08,482 --> 01:43:11,026
Drugs and money.
We got him, baby.

1457
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:22,663
This dude is loaded.

1458
01:43:23,247 --> 01:43:27,251
Bet he thinks he's a damn genius,
transporting them in dead bodies.

1459
01:43:28,252 --> 01:43:29,753
Let's get this body.

1460
01:43:31,839 --> 01:43:33,465
Mike, you got company, man.

1461
01:43:33,674 --> 01:43:36,718
Somebody's coming. Hide!
Give me the X. Give me the X.

1462
01:43:38,887 --> 01:43:40,264
You gotta stall them.

1463
01:43:46,854 --> 01:43:48,522
Hide! Hide! Hide!

1464
01:43:48,981 --> 01:43:49,940
Shit!

1465
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,484
Punk kids do this? Go check it out.

1466
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:53,694
Hide!

1467
01:43:57,614 --> 01:44:01,577
Marcus! Why would you...?
That's just not smart, man.

1468
01:44:05,831 --> 01:44:08,000
You tell Theresa, I'll kill you.

1469
01:44:13,839 --> 01:44:15,424
Bimbo's next.

1470
01:44:15,841 --> 01:44:18,927
Oh, God. Not that. Not the bimbo.

1471
01:44:20,345 --> 01:44:22,347
Let's hurry this shit up.

1472
01:44:32,232 --> 01:44:33,942
Shit.

1473
01:44:34,234 --> 01:44:36,195
We got a big problem.
We got a big problem.

1474
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:38,530
Drive that ambulance
into the building right now.

1475
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:42,159
- Crash it into the building!
- No. Not me, baby.

1476
01:44:42,326 --> 01:44:44,286
I got too many crashes on my file.
You do it.

1477
01:44:44,495 --> 01:44:47,706
No. You're kidding. I got red-flagged
last month for the thing.

1478
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:51,335
You know how much the city paid.
I can't have another ding on my file.

1479
01:44:53,086 --> 01:44:55,881
Mike, my man, we want to help
you out here, you know...

1480
01:44:56,048 --> 01:44:59,301
...but we got a couple of administration
problems over here, you know?

1481
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:02,095
So how about we give sirens
and some flashing lights?

1482
01:45:02,346 --> 01:45:03,597
Make a racket. How's that?

1483
01:45:04,598 --> 01:45:06,141
Negative! Negative!

1484
01:45:06,391 --> 01:45:08,560
Crash that ambulance
into the building right now!

1485
01:45:08,894 --> 01:45:11,396
We want to help the team out
and everything, but...

1486
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:13,357
But I'm not getting suspended
for this.

1487
01:45:13,565 --> 01:45:17,694
Okay, I plan on whupping y'all
asses the second I get out of here.

1488
01:45:17,903 --> 01:45:20,364
- Crash into the building right now!
- Screw it.

1489
01:45:20,531 --> 01:45:22,157
Just the price of cop business.

1490
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,326
Now, get her on the table.

1491
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:36,505
Oh, my God.

1492
01:45:39,216 --> 01:45:42,261
Jeez! What the hell!
I'm so... I'm so...

1493
01:45:42,469 --> 01:45:43,679
That's tragic, man.

1494
01:45:43,887 --> 01:45:45,639
Go, go, go. Back door's clear.
Go! Go!

1495
01:45:46,056 --> 01:45:47,683
Get up, Marcus!

1496
01:45:48,058 --> 01:45:50,477
The gas got stuck. I didn't mean to.

1497
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:58,735
Oh, man.

1498
01:46:00,863 --> 01:46:02,906
Supple leather, you know.

1499
01:46:04,783 --> 01:46:06,618
You ever rub your leather?

1500
01:46:06,785 --> 01:46:10,038
You know, like, just rub it.
See how good it feels.

1501
01:46:13,458 --> 01:46:15,919
What does love mean to you, Mike?

1502
01:46:16,545 --> 01:46:19,047
Don't worry about me and my love.

1503
01:46:20,048 --> 01:46:22,634
Look, I got plenty of love in my life.

1504
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,679
Like a woman's butt.

1505
01:46:25,888 --> 01:46:28,640
- Don't do that.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mike.

1506
01:46:28,849 --> 01:46:30,893
Let's just concentrate
and get this warrant.

1507
01:46:31,101 --> 01:46:32,603
I need to express right now.

1508
01:46:32,811 --> 01:46:36,815
I want you to know, if this is
our last job, I really appreciate you.

1509
01:46:37,065 --> 01:46:38,192
Okay?

1510
01:46:38,358 --> 01:46:39,484
No, this is not gay shit.

1511
01:46:39,735 --> 01:46:42,279
This is man shit.
You know what I mean?

1512
01:46:42,529 --> 01:46:44,740
And you a beautiful man.
You know?

1513
01:46:44,948 --> 01:46:47,284
And when you let the beautiful side...

1514
01:46:48,702 --> 01:46:50,621
- What?
- Look at your pupils.

1515
01:46:50,787 --> 01:46:52,915
How am I look at my pupil?
What, I'm...

1516
01:46:53,582 --> 01:46:56,460
Yo, what are you taking?
Did you take some of that X?

1517
01:46:57,002 --> 01:47:00,088
- Hey, look, give me a hug.
- Hey, get off. Listen, listen. Listen!

1518
01:47:00,297 --> 01:47:04,134
We need this warrant. Do not
fuck this up. Pull yourself together.

1519
01:47:10,432 --> 01:47:12,017
Evening, captain.

1520
01:47:12,226 --> 01:47:13,810
Hello...

1521
01:47:14,019 --> 01:47:15,479
..."capteeon."

1522
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:18,690
So how do you two plan to fuck up
my evening tonight?

1523
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:22,236
Well, captain, believe me,
we would not be here...

1524
01:47:22,444 --> 01:47:25,572
...if it weren't seriously,
utterly important.

1525
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:27,533
Get in here.

1526
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,285
Get off me!

1527
01:47:39,378 --> 01:47:43,048
Cap, this is beautiful.

1528
01:47:43,257 --> 01:47:45,509
Have such a warm feel,
you know.

1529
01:47:45,759 --> 01:47:48,846
Sort of like a "ving shwa."
What's it, Mike?

1530
01:47:49,096 --> 01:47:52,975
- It was a V, like a "von schwo."
- Why don't you have a seat?

1531
01:47:53,183 --> 01:47:56,019
- Or "ven wangs" or...
- Feng shui.

1532
01:47:56,228 --> 01:47:57,688
"Von sway."

1533
01:47:58,188 --> 01:48:00,566
You have a "von sway" home.

1534
01:48:00,774 --> 01:48:02,109
Make yourself at home.

1535
01:48:02,317 --> 01:48:05,279
All right, captain, I know you said
that Johnny Tapia was hands...

1536
01:48:05,487 --> 01:48:08,157
- Oh, no! No!
- Look, captain, we got him. It's a wrap.

1537
01:48:08,365 --> 01:48:11,785
Look, we messed up today,
but we got him. Please just look.

1538
01:48:11,994 --> 01:48:15,038
- How do I move it?
- Here, you flip through the pictures.

1539
01:48:16,039 --> 01:48:18,208
You can flip...
You can flip through picture...

1540
01:48:18,834 --> 01:48:20,043
This is horrible.

1541
01:48:25,424 --> 01:48:28,177
- Take the picture.
- You can look really close.

1542
01:48:28,343 --> 01:48:30,804
Listen, we got everything
that we need to take this dude.

1543
01:48:31,597 --> 01:48:33,098
Oh, God.

1544
01:48:33,682 --> 01:48:35,642
They're taking the organs out.

1545
01:48:35,851 --> 01:48:39,313
Right there you can... You can...
Yeah. If you look there...

1546
01:48:39,605 --> 01:48:41,190
Oh, gosh.

1547
01:48:44,776 --> 01:48:47,237
This is good. That's horrible.

1548
01:48:49,156 --> 01:48:50,657
Look at this.

1549
01:48:51,366 --> 01:48:55,746
Everybody just needs to relax.
Whoosah. Whoosah. Whoosah.

1550
01:48:55,871 --> 01:48:59,374
What are you doing? Marcus,
it's 2 a.m. Get your hands off me.

1551
01:49:00,751 --> 01:49:04,671
Remember we said we
were gonna call Vargas and Reyes?

1552
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,299
- No, I don't...
- Call Vargas!

1553
01:49:07,758 --> 01:49:10,093
Tell him the thing
we said to tell him.

1554
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:13,514
- What thing?
- Tell him we said... About yesterday.

1555
01:49:14,389 --> 01:49:15,891
And tell him about the thing.

1556
01:49:16,099 --> 01:49:18,727
So, captain, listen,
we've also got videotape.

1557
01:49:18,894 --> 01:49:21,605
Yesterday, we fucked up bad.
But we got him now.

1558
01:49:22,231 --> 01:49:23,565
Oh, shit.

1559
01:49:23,815 --> 01:49:25,734
- What?
- No, a lot of times with these...

1560
01:49:25,943 --> 01:49:27,027
Oh, shit!

1561
01:49:27,236 --> 01:49:29,404
- What? Did I erase it?
- No. We got video.

1562
01:49:29,655 --> 01:49:32,407
- We got fucking...
- Oh. Let me see.

1563
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:35,077
Oh, shit.

1564
01:49:35,285 --> 01:49:37,579
He's shipping the drugs around
the country in bodies.

1565
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:39,790
We found coffins of cash,
tagged for Cuba.

1566
01:49:39,998 --> 01:49:42,751
And you think Tapia's about
to move out with all this money?

1567
01:49:43,293 --> 01:49:45,921
I love it when you call me Bunny Nose.

1568
01:49:46,129 --> 01:49:47,631
Shit!

1569
01:49:47,798 --> 01:49:49,174
Yeah, I do, girl.

1570
01:49:49,383 --> 01:49:51,593
You should see this sexy shit
I got on.

1571
01:49:51,802 --> 01:49:53,595
Who the hell are you talking to?

1572
01:49:53,804 --> 01:49:56,598
I talked to Vargas and...

1573
01:49:57,391 --> 01:50:01,812
...Ru... Reyes. They said that
they're down for whatever.

1574
01:50:02,104 --> 01:50:04,773
This is a nice fish, you know.

1575
01:50:04,982 --> 01:50:08,318
Big fucking eyes,
but a nice fucking fish.

1576
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:10,696
We need this warrant, captain.

1577
01:50:11,155 --> 01:50:12,698
Let's take this scumbag down.

1578
01:50:18,829 --> 01:50:20,664
What the fuck is going on?

1579
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:25,919
- He ingested X.
- You okay, pal? Take it easy.

1580
01:50:27,421 --> 01:50:28,422
Okay, thank you.

1581
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:30,799
Poison lady says we gotta
keep him cool.

1582
01:50:31,049 --> 01:50:33,802
Otherwise, he's burning up,
he can get brain damage.

1583
01:50:34,052 --> 01:50:35,804
Nobody'll even notice that.

1584
01:50:40,893 --> 01:50:42,895
Mike, I got an erection.

1585
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:46,648
Take me home.

1586
01:50:47,232 --> 01:50:50,694
Call the wife, tell her I'm on the way.

1587
01:51:00,662 --> 01:51:02,706
Hope you guys hear me.

1588
01:51:05,542 --> 01:51:08,170
- We got her. Loud and clear.
- She's in.

1589
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,880
Showtime.

1590
01:51:10,172 --> 01:51:12,174
Palm Mortuary, Alpha team.

1591
01:51:12,424 --> 01:51:15,719
- Tapia's mansion, Delta.
- Dixie Boy boat dock, Bravo.

1592
01:51:15,928 --> 01:51:18,805
Coast Guard gunships,
anything that hits the water.

1593
01:51:19,014 --> 01:51:20,849
We hit all three places
simultaneously.

1594
01:51:21,391 --> 01:51:25,896
Tac up at 08:45.
We go hot at 09:00 sharp.

1595
01:51:26,188 --> 01:51:27,147
Bring the noise.

1596
01:51:34,905 --> 01:51:38,200
You're such a beautiful girl.

1597
01:51:38,408 --> 01:51:39,993
Thank you.

1598
01:51:40,577 --> 01:51:42,579
- Johnny.
- Yeah?

1599
01:51:42,871 --> 01:51:44,832
- Is she a Negro?
- Please, Mama!

1600
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,458
Shut up! Get out of here!

1601
01:51:47,751 --> 01:51:49,461
You make your bed, you sleep in it!

1602
01:51:57,594 --> 01:51:59,304
Make way!

1603
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,600
- Get down!
- Don't fucking move!

1604
01:52:04,476 --> 01:52:07,563
You take risks. I like that.

1605
01:52:08,105 --> 01:52:09,314
Or...

1606
01:52:12,109 --> 01:52:15,445
...maybe I'm the one
taking a risk on you. Huh?

1607
01:52:16,196 --> 01:52:17,447
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1608
01:52:20,117 --> 01:52:22,995
Excuse me, boss.
We need to talk now.

1609
01:52:23,662 --> 01:52:25,164
Something's going on outside.

1610
01:52:26,623 --> 01:52:28,667
- Cops.
- What the fuck do you mean, cops?

1611
01:52:31,086 --> 01:52:32,546
Goddamn it.

1612
01:52:34,131 --> 01:52:36,633
DEA. You don't plan
on entering, do you?

1613
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:40,971
- We have a warrant to get in there.
- A UC's inside. She's gotta leave first.

1614
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:42,306
You got two minutes.

1615
01:52:42,514 --> 01:52:44,474
- Call her on her cell.
- Yes, sir.

1616
01:52:45,767 --> 01:52:47,603
Cut the power to the house.

1617
01:52:49,313 --> 01:52:51,273
- You got her? Well, let's go.
- No, sir.

1618
01:52:55,736 --> 01:52:57,112
We got a bogey.

1619
01:53:00,824 --> 01:53:05,746
God. This is for you, Josef,
and me and Mother Russia.

1620
01:53:08,499 --> 01:53:11,043
They're not gangbanger homeys.
They're cops.

1621
01:53:11,335 --> 01:53:12,461
Cops?!

1622
01:53:13,003 --> 01:53:17,299
They weren't trying to hit the load.
I think they were looking after her.

1623
01:53:24,765 --> 01:53:26,016
Now, you tell me...

1624
01:53:26,225 --> 01:53:28,852
...where is the wire?
- They made her.

1625
01:53:29,686 --> 01:53:32,022
We gotta get her out. Go! Come on!

1626
01:53:32,564 --> 01:53:36,401
Hey, Tapia, you fucking mother.

1627
01:53:42,199 --> 01:53:44,868
The Russian Grim Reaper is here.

1628
01:53:46,036 --> 01:53:47,746
Everything's in here.

1629
01:53:48,497 --> 01:53:51,291
- Oh, shit.
- Goddamn.

1630
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:54,378
Eyeball, has anything left this
mortuary in the past two hours?

1631
01:53:54,586 --> 01:53:58,048
A four-hearse funeral just left.
We trailed them to Miami Harbor.

1632
01:53:58,590 --> 01:54:01,844
Miami Air, Tapia's running his
money to Cuba. Get us a chopper!

1633
01:54:08,809 --> 01:54:11,270
Hey, Tapia!

1634
01:54:12,604 --> 01:54:14,773
You scared of me,
you little scumbag?!

1635
01:54:14,982 --> 01:54:17,442
- We got some heat.
- Pull the car back.

1636
01:54:17,734 --> 01:54:20,737
I'll fucking kill you!
Who the hell are you?

1637
01:54:20,946 --> 01:54:22,906
- Drop the weapon!
- Drop the weapon now!

1638
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,784
- I'm with you guys!
- Put it down, now!

1639
01:54:26,034 --> 01:54:27,703
- I'm over here!
- Shut up!

1640
01:54:27,911 --> 01:54:30,581
- Drop the weapon!
- I'll kill that son of a bitch!

1641
01:54:41,216 --> 01:54:44,094
This is Alpha. Heads up to the
Coast Guard Sharks and Bravo Team.

1642
01:54:44,303 --> 01:54:46,471
Close the harbor.
Freeze any moving speedboat.

1643
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,681
This is Bravo.

1644
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:50,767
We got a go-fast slinging a high rate
of speed down Miami harbor.

1645
01:54:50,976 --> 01:54:52,644
Stop that boat.

1646
01:55:07,784 --> 01:55:09,328
This guy's moving us.

1647
01:55:12,456 --> 01:55:14,416
Think we're going for the bridge.

1648
01:55:44,321 --> 01:55:46,073
Coast Guard, we're going in.

1649
01:55:47,783 --> 01:55:49,576
Miami Police. Shut it down.

1650
01:55:49,827 --> 01:55:52,162
This is the police. Shut it down.

1651
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,170
- Watch out, he got a weapon.
- Bail out!

1652
01:56:04,716 --> 01:56:06,635
Coast Guard, take him down.
Burn him.

1653
01:56:17,271 --> 01:56:20,065
Vessel is dead in the water.
Vessel is dead in the water.

1654
01:56:23,694 --> 01:56:25,571
This is what we do.

1655
01:56:29,283 --> 01:56:31,743
Oh, man, it's full up.
It's full up.

1656
01:56:32,035 --> 01:56:33,662
It's a righteous bust.

1657
01:56:43,589 --> 01:56:45,257
How the hell they slip away?

1658
01:56:46,383 --> 01:56:48,468
Give me the watch commander
on the horn.

1659
01:56:48,677 --> 01:56:51,221
Do you know her brother
on Miami PD? Find him.

1660
01:56:52,055 --> 01:56:56,226
Do you know anyone
who might want to save your life?

1661
01:57:01,190 --> 01:57:03,525
- Hello?
- Marcus, they...!

1662
01:57:03,734 --> 01:57:07,321
You have $ 100 million of mine...

1663
01:57:07,529 --> 01:57:09,907
...and I want it back in 48 hours.

1664
01:57:21,919 --> 01:57:23,921
Shit just got real.

1665
01:57:34,681 --> 01:57:36,600
Jack Snell, DEA.

1666
01:57:36,808 --> 01:57:38,393
Agent Eames, FBI...

1667
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:40,771
...who has just informed me...

1668
01:57:41,146 --> 01:57:45,484
...that satellite pinpointed Tapia's jet
in Cuban airspace 20 minutes ago.

1669
01:57:45,651 --> 01:57:47,319
Cuba?

1670
01:57:47,569 --> 01:57:50,739
United States does not negotiate
with hostage-takers.

1671
01:57:50,989 --> 01:57:52,950
Especially Cuban hostage-takers.

1672
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,661
It's a delicate situation.

1673
01:57:56,245 --> 01:57:59,706
This is not just a situation.
This is my sister.

1674
01:57:59,915 --> 01:58:02,751
Off the record,
all State Department agencies...

1675
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,963
...are using their back-channel
contacts for a diplomatic solution.

1676
01:58:06,129 --> 01:58:09,258
You know, by the time
y'all finish being diplomatic...

1677
01:58:09,466 --> 01:58:13,011
...my sister could be in
a fucking box. This is bullshit.

1678
01:58:35,325 --> 01:58:37,703
He ain't getting away
from us that easy.

1679
01:58:47,379 --> 01:58:49,089
We ride together...

1680
01:58:50,757 --> 01:58:52,426
...we die together.

1681
01:58:54,469 --> 01:58:56,180
Bad boys for life.

1682
01:59:03,187 --> 01:59:05,355
We just gotta do it ourselves, man.

1683
01:59:33,091 --> 01:59:34,426
I don't know you.

1684
01:59:34,635 --> 01:59:37,554
You look like you're about to do
something stupid. I'm in.

1685
01:59:38,305 --> 01:59:40,891
Dodd tell you how
crazy us ex-Delta guys are?

1686
01:59:42,226 --> 01:59:44,019
My brother, Tito, lives in Cuba.

1687
01:59:44,228 --> 01:59:47,272
He's a little crazy, but he's hooked up
with the underground.

1688
01:59:47,481 --> 01:59:50,108
Weapons, men, a safe house.
Whatever we need.

1689
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,569
You can forget about passports
and all that stuff.

1690
01:59:52,736 --> 01:59:55,739
Because if the Cubans catch us,
we're all dead.

1691
01:59:56,073 --> 01:59:59,743
My brother Tito's in Alpha 66,
the Anti-Castro Underground.

1692
01:59:59,952 --> 02:00:01,620
What does that have to do
with Tapia?

1693
02:00:02,329 --> 02:00:05,541
Everything. Tapia's the biggest
supplier of drug cash to Castro.

1694
02:00:05,791 --> 02:00:07,668
So Alpha 66 will be all over him.

1695
02:00:07,918 --> 02:00:12,047
Brother, that is perfect. He says he
can get men on the tunnel right away.

1696
02:00:12,256 --> 02:00:13,465
Let me holler at him.

1697
02:00:14,258 --> 02:00:17,427
Tito, we need layout, security,
the whole deal.

1698
02:00:17,636 --> 02:00:21,598
We got info that Tapia's got a casket
coming in tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

1699
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:24,768
Yeah, that might be our way in.
Yeah.

1700
02:00:25,477 --> 02:00:29,356
Brought you a little care package
from my friends over at the CIA.

1701
02:00:29,606 --> 02:00:32,734
They want to help.
And don't ask me.

1702
02:00:33,777 --> 02:00:34,987
They're spies.

1703
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:39,825
Former Delta Intel and Demo.
Requesting permission to tag along.

1704
02:00:56,508 --> 02:00:59,511
Ronnie, I hear there's a boat
on fire off the coast of Cuba.

1705
02:01:00,012 --> 02:01:02,514
Shouldn't we break
international waters to help them?

1706
02:01:02,806 --> 02:01:03,891
That's my dog.

1707
02:01:08,812 --> 02:01:10,564
Point of no return.

1708
02:01:11,064 --> 02:01:13,484
I want to thank y'all
from the bottom of my heart.

1709
02:01:14,902 --> 02:01:19,198
- Mike, look, I just...
- Tell me when we get back.

1710
02:01:20,991 --> 02:01:22,784
The target's in sight. I see the boat.

1711
02:01:22,993 --> 02:01:25,746
Roger. Target 12 o'clock.
300 yards.

1712
02:01:28,332 --> 02:01:30,792
Roper in the door. Stand by.

1713
02:01:34,505 --> 02:01:36,340
Go! Go! Go!

1714
02:01:47,768 --> 02:01:50,604
- Tito?
- Welcome to Cuba.

1715
02:02:08,205 --> 02:02:13,001
Damn. What's up with the safe house
across the street from Tapia's crib?

1716
02:02:13,168 --> 02:02:14,962
This is the last place
anyone would look.

1717
02:02:15,212 --> 02:02:19,091
We've been watching the place.
Guards play soccer each day at 3:30.

1718
02:02:20,008 --> 02:02:24,054
The bad news, everyone knows he
uses the army like his bodyguards.

1719
02:02:25,055 --> 02:02:28,308
- This is Tapia's compound.
- CIA hooked us up, huh?

1720
02:02:28,559 --> 02:02:31,979
Yeah. This LIDAR laser technology
even shows his escape tunnel.

1721
02:02:32,187 --> 02:02:34,731
The alarm security is wired
to the army.

1722
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:38,569
We're screwed if we don't blow up this
security room before we make a move.

1723
02:02:38,777 --> 02:02:40,487
The tunnel we're digging
branches off.

1724
02:02:40,737 --> 02:02:44,575
One under his back yard
and the other into his escape tunnel.

1725
02:02:45,492 --> 02:02:47,077
We gotta hurry up.

1726
02:02:48,537 --> 02:02:51,957
See? I told you my brother
was a maniac.

1727
02:02:53,625 --> 02:02:56,003
- How we looking?
- Let me check it out.

1728
02:03:15,272 --> 02:03:17,399
Papi, you look like Jesus.

1729
02:03:18,108 --> 02:03:20,402
Why they call this
The Last Supper?

1730
02:03:20,611 --> 02:03:24,656
It was the last time they were all
together before Jesus was crucified.

1731
02:03:25,532 --> 02:03:27,326
Crucified?

1732
02:03:28,535 --> 02:03:30,829
Hold your ears. Hey, you.

1733
02:03:31,371 --> 02:03:35,459
Listen to me. This is fucking
depressing! You understand?!

1734
02:03:35,667 --> 02:03:37,794
I mean, who had this fucking idea?

1735
02:03:38,795 --> 02:03:42,799
I just want little angels
looking down on me.

1736
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,887
Okay, here's the ocean,
300 yards from Tapia's house.

1737
02:03:47,137 --> 02:03:50,766
We're here. Safe house.
First tunnel comes through to here.

1738
02:03:50,974 --> 02:03:53,477
First team takes out
the security station.

1739
02:03:53,685 --> 02:03:56,563
Second tunnel comes through
into the center of the house.

1740
02:03:56,855 --> 02:04:00,192
Tito, your contacts inside
said Syd's in the last bedroom...

1741
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:01,735
...on the second floor, right?

1742
02:04:01,944 --> 02:04:04,321
Lupe's one of us.
If she says your sister's there...

1743
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:05,572
...she is there.

1744
02:04:05,739 --> 02:04:09,618
Three o'clock sharp, the bag of cats
and iguanas go over the fence.

1745
02:04:09,827 --> 02:04:13,121
Hopefully the motion detectors'll go
so crazy security'll shut them off.

1746
02:04:13,372 --> 02:04:16,041
My guys will watch the outside
for any military.

1747
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:18,252
If they come, that's bad.

1748
02:04:27,636 --> 02:04:29,263
Let's make this count, guys.

1749
02:04:53,203 --> 02:04:54,830
We're in.

1750
02:05:14,057 --> 02:05:16,935
Goddamn it, it's the fifth time today.

1751
02:05:17,561 --> 02:05:21,982
Carlos, turn off the motion sensors
till we get it fixed.

1752
02:05:22,274 --> 02:05:24,443
- Look what I found. Can I keep them?
- No.

1753
02:05:24,776 --> 02:05:26,111
All right, guys...

1754
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:29,448
...sensors are down. Time to move.
- We are 100% go.

1755
02:05:30,699 --> 02:05:32,326
Let's go.

1756
02:05:48,258 --> 02:05:51,845
Left. Left. Yeah. There we go.
This is not as easy as it looks.

1757
02:06:10,906 --> 02:06:13,116
Okay, we're at the T.
Split right.

1758
02:06:16,161 --> 02:06:17,579
Good luck, guys.

1759
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:23,669
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

1760
02:06:26,129 --> 02:06:29,675
Find the soccer game.
Sniff it out, baby. Sniff it out.

1761
02:06:35,848 --> 02:06:37,641
To the left. To the left. Oh, shit.

1762
02:06:44,148 --> 02:06:46,150
Oh, you did not see me.

1763
02:06:50,654 --> 02:06:53,949
- Ready to bust into the escape tunnel.
- There we go. Soccer.

1764
02:07:06,503 --> 02:07:07,588
Sorry.

1765
02:07:15,137 --> 02:07:16,805
Go, go, go, go, go!

1766
02:07:32,905 --> 02:07:34,448
Go!

1767
02:07:36,158 --> 02:07:37,743
Get me the American bitch.

1768
02:07:37,993 --> 02:07:40,329
Call General Santos.
Tell him I need him now!

1769
02:07:40,996 --> 02:07:43,665
Sorry, darling. Take her outside
to safety. Come on.

1770
02:08:02,726 --> 02:08:04,686
- Carlos, this is not good!
- I know!

1771
02:08:05,062 --> 02:08:07,481
- Where is General Santos?!
- He's coming, boss!

1772
02:08:14,404 --> 02:08:17,533
You fucking maricons!
I'm gonna blow your head off!

1773
02:08:18,033 --> 02:08:19,409
Fuck!

1774
02:08:19,743 --> 02:08:23,664
What's happened to this gun?
My son will slice you into chorizo.

1775
02:08:24,248 --> 02:08:26,041
- Mama, I'm very sorry.
- You little puta!

1776
02:08:35,884 --> 02:08:38,220
- Vargas, you in?
- We got Mama and the girl.

1777
02:08:38,428 --> 02:08:40,556
We're entering the house. Go!

1778
02:08:55,154 --> 02:08:56,488
Move! Move! Move!

1779
02:09:09,501 --> 02:09:12,671
Everything's clear outside.
You got 30 seconds max. Haul ass.

1780
02:09:17,301 --> 02:09:20,804
You got two rovers on the balcony.
I can't get a shot off.

1781
02:09:23,307 --> 02:09:25,434
See the rover? I missed him!

1782
02:09:31,815 --> 02:09:33,192
Get down! Get down now!

1783
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:34,526
- Get down!
- Down!

1784
02:09:37,196 --> 02:09:39,198
Move! Move! Move!

1785
02:09:39,615 --> 02:09:41,200
- Marcus!
- Come on!

1786
02:09:41,408 --> 02:09:43,160
Move! We got the package.

1787
02:09:43,368 --> 02:09:45,913
Move now. It's turning
into a real bad day.

1788
02:09:46,121 --> 02:09:49,374
- Vargas, we're coming back. Cover us!
- We got you covered, baby.

1789
02:10:03,263 --> 02:10:05,140
Somebody talk to me.
What's going on?

1790
02:10:05,349 --> 02:10:06,683
The military is everywhere.

1791
02:10:13,982 --> 02:10:17,069
- This is bad, I have to go.
- Listen, you have a lot of company.

1792
02:10:17,277 --> 02:10:19,613
Get out of there now!

1793
02:10:26,954 --> 02:10:28,497
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1794
02:10:29,832 --> 02:10:31,625
Head for the tunnel. I'll blow this.

1795
02:10:35,712 --> 02:10:37,506
Go, go! Get out!

1796
02:10:50,853 --> 02:10:52,813
Mike, you gotta get out.

1797
02:10:54,273 --> 02:10:54,398
Vargas! Get out! Abort!

1798
02:10:54,398 --> 02:10:56,525
Vargas! Get out! Abort!

1799
02:10:56,733 --> 02:10:58,735
We won't reach the tunnel!
Go to plan B.

1800
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,863
- We're going to plan B!
- What plan B?!

1801
02:11:01,071 --> 02:11:02,489
You don't pay attention to shit!

1802
02:11:02,698 --> 02:11:04,449
- What's the plan B?
- That's your problem!

1803
02:11:04,658 --> 02:11:06,577
Are you fucking shitting me?
Let's go!

1804
02:11:06,827 --> 02:11:08,328
- Follow me! Follow me!
- I will...

1805
02:11:08,579 --> 02:11:11,290
Plan B? What the hell is plan B?

1806
02:11:12,499 --> 02:11:15,794
- Tito, what you doing here?
- You need a Cuban guide, fool.

1807
02:11:16,003 --> 02:11:17,421
This way!

1808
02:11:19,006 --> 02:11:21,717
- They won't make it to the tunnel.
- Let's blow out of here!

1809
02:11:24,761 --> 02:11:26,430
Keys, keys, keys!

1810
02:11:41,653 --> 02:11:44,698
Oh, my God! No! God!
Oh, my God!

1811
02:11:48,911 --> 02:11:50,829
Plan B did not have
that big-ass gun in it!

1812
02:11:51,246 --> 02:11:54,791
You call this plan B?!
What the plan B stand for? Bullshit!

1813
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:55,959
Do you want to drive?!

1814
02:11:56,168 --> 02:11:58,629
Yeah, pull over by the fuckers
with the machine guns!

1815
02:11:58,837 --> 02:12:00,172
Shit!

1816
02:12:08,972 --> 02:12:10,766
I am not to be fucked with!

1817
02:12:12,935 --> 02:12:16,563
I missed the part of the meeting when
you drive through the dining room.

1818
02:12:16,814 --> 02:12:18,607
And right out the front door.

1819
02:12:35,833 --> 02:12:37,334
Get in the truck!

1820
02:12:41,672 --> 02:12:42,965
Cuban army was everywhere.

1821
02:12:59,356 --> 02:13:01,942
- Gotta get us to Guantanamo Bay!
- No.

1822
02:13:02,151 --> 02:13:04,027
You can't drive onto
a U.S. Naval base.

1823
02:13:04,236 --> 02:13:05,612
Hey, we're Americans, okay?

1824
02:13:09,241 --> 02:13:12,244
Marcus, you know how when
we usually get in these situations...

1825
02:13:12,452 --> 02:13:15,956
...I'm always trying to make you
feel better, like we'll be all right.

1826
02:13:16,206 --> 02:13:18,041
- Yeah, yeah.
- I could say it...

1827
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:20,669
...but that'd be a bunch
of bullshit today.

1828
02:13:31,013 --> 02:13:32,306
Military, military.

1829
02:13:32,514 --> 02:13:34,641
- Which way?!
- No, right! Right! Go right!

1830
02:13:40,147 --> 02:13:42,816
These are drug dealer shacks.
They make cocaine here.

1831
02:13:43,025 --> 02:13:45,152
Hope there's shit in there
that likes to blow.

1832
02:13:54,244 --> 02:13:56,413
Faster! I'll kill you, motherfucker!

1833
02:13:56,663 --> 02:13:57,748
I'm gonna go for it.

1834
02:13:57,998 --> 02:14:00,000
- This is a big-ass hill.
- Shit.

1835
02:14:08,091 --> 02:14:12,012
- Oh, shit! Is this still called plan B?
- No, this is definitely plan C.

1836
02:14:47,089 --> 02:14:48,090
Oh, Jesus!

1837
02:15:07,526 --> 02:15:09,194
God! God!

1838
02:15:09,361 --> 02:15:11,822
Everybody start shooting
at somebody!

1839
02:15:14,825 --> 02:15:16,326
Shoot! Shoot!

1840
02:15:20,998 --> 02:15:23,959
- Shit! I'm out!
- I got two rounds left.

1841
02:15:24,168 --> 02:15:25,711
- One in the chamber.
- I'm out.

1842
02:15:25,919 --> 02:15:28,213
All these guns
and none of you got no bullets?!

1843
02:15:28,422 --> 02:15:31,633
- I got one in my hip!
- Oh, God, he's hit!

1844
02:15:34,178 --> 02:15:35,470
There! Gitmo!

1845
02:15:37,347 --> 02:15:39,391
U.S. Soil, baby. U.S. Soil.

1846
02:15:39,641 --> 02:15:40,601
Come on! Go!

1847
02:15:42,186 --> 02:15:45,147
- Americans on the way!
- Whoa, watch...

1848
02:15:51,195 --> 02:15:52,613
Run it! Run it!

1849
02:16:08,337 --> 02:16:09,796
Go.

1850
02:16:22,226 --> 02:16:23,769
Go! Go! Go!

1851
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:33,111
Fuck.

1852
02:16:36,073 --> 02:16:37,199
Mike!

1853
02:16:56,343 --> 02:16:58,178
We're Americans!

1854
02:16:58,387 --> 02:17:01,515
I pay my motherfucking taxes!
Shoot them!

1855
02:17:01,723 --> 02:17:04,101
Hey, fucking gringo. Drop the gun!

1856
02:17:04,309 --> 02:17:07,354
Put it down! Put it down!

1857
02:17:11,441 --> 02:17:15,821
They can't help you.
You're staying in Cuba.

1858
02:17:20,409 --> 02:17:22,828
You are standing
on a live minefield!

1859
02:17:23,162 --> 02:17:24,621
Do not move!

1860
02:17:26,415 --> 02:17:29,543
Look, why don't we all go home...

1861
02:17:29,751 --> 02:17:32,212
Well, we'll go home,
you go to a hotel.

1862
02:17:32,421 --> 02:17:36,383
Work this shit out another day. None
of us is having a good day right now.

1863
02:17:36,592 --> 02:17:37,843
- Give me the gun!
- Okay.

1864
02:17:38,135 --> 02:17:39,887
I'll toss it right at your feet...

1865
02:17:40,053 --> 02:17:42,431
...right next to the mine.

1866
02:18:38,278 --> 02:18:40,531
Now, that's how
you supposed to shoot!

1867
02:18:40,739 --> 02:18:43,659
From now on,
that's how you shoot!

1868
02:18:44,910 --> 02:18:47,746
Oh, I want my next partner
to shoot just like that.

1869
02:18:47,955 --> 02:18:51,416
It take a dysfunctional motherfucker
to bust somebody in the head like that.

1870
02:18:51,667 --> 02:18:53,502
That's some dysfunctional shit.

1871
02:18:53,710 --> 02:18:56,338
My next partner'll invite me
to his barbecues, though.

1872
02:18:56,547 --> 02:18:58,590
Come here, girl. Come here.

1873
02:19:00,884 --> 02:19:03,178
I came all the way to Cuba for this.

1874
02:19:05,681 --> 02:19:07,808
Come on.

1875
02:19:08,016 --> 02:19:10,185
Y'all gotta do that
around land mines?

1876
02:19:13,897 --> 02:19:17,651
Would you tell them that that shit is
dangerous around these land mines?

1877
02:19:30,372 --> 02:19:34,585
You know, Mike, this ain't easy
for me, but I was wrong.

1878
02:19:34,793 --> 02:19:38,672
I'll be very proud for you
to date my sister.

1879
02:19:38,881 --> 02:19:40,424
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

1880
02:19:40,924 --> 02:19:42,968
You know, me and Syd
thought about it...

1881
02:19:43,135 --> 02:19:45,179
...and your behavior
was so crazy that...

1882
02:19:45,429 --> 02:19:50,058
...any magic we could've captured,
probably best if we didn't... You know.

1883
02:19:50,267 --> 02:19:52,895
You're just gonna take advantage
of my little sister?

1884
02:19:53,103 --> 02:19:54,605
Already you breaking her heart?

1885
02:19:54,813 --> 02:19:57,232
- What you talking about?
- She not good enough for you?

1886
02:19:57,774 --> 02:20:00,152
Syd, Mike says you ain't shit!

1887
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:03,238
Now, why would you scream out
some crazy nonsense like that?

1888
02:20:03,489 --> 02:20:08,118
I don't appreciate you coming here,
disrespecting me in my new pool.

1889
02:20:08,327 --> 02:20:09,536
I bought your new pool.

1890
02:20:09,786 --> 02:20:14,583
Why don't you hook this pool up
to your Ferrari and drag it out of here?

1891
02:20:14,791 --> 02:20:16,293
First of all, I was joking.

1892
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:19,546
And second of all, all this right here,
smell yourself right now.

1893
02:20:19,713 --> 02:20:21,924
Because this moment is
what's wrong with you.

1894
02:20:22,132 --> 02:20:24,301
I got the transfer papers
in the trash can.

1895
02:20:24,635 --> 02:20:26,845
I'll get them and glue them
the fuck up.

1896
02:20:27,137 --> 02:20:28,347
- Glue them up.
- What?

1897
02:20:28,555 --> 02:20:30,390
- Want some glue?
- We won't be partners no more.

1898
02:20:30,641 --> 02:20:31,600
I got glue in the car.

1899
02:20:31,809 --> 02:20:35,604
I'm trying to talk to you. It's hot, I
feel like I'm cooking in this fucker...

1900
02:20:35,813 --> 02:20:38,774
...and I gotta hear shit out of you?
Then on top of that shit...

1901
02:20:38,982 --> 02:20:40,901
...you gonna dog my baby sister?

1902
02:20:45,489 --> 02:20:47,366
Oh, this that bullshit!

1903
02:20:52,955 --> 02:20:54,248
Dad!

1904
02:20:54,498 --> 02:20:55,457
Dad!

1905
02:20:55,666 --> 02:20:59,169
I kept the warranty.
I kept the warranty!

1906
02:21:00,254 --> 02:21:02,130
Bad boys, bad boys

1907
02:21:02,339 --> 02:21:03,966
What you gonna do?

1908
02:21:04,174 --> 02:21:07,177
What you gonna do
When we come for you?

1909
02:21:11,473 --> 02:21:13,767
Bad boys, bad...

1910
02:21:16,770 --> 02:21:19,106
Come on, you gotta learn the words.

1911
02:21:19,314 --> 02:21:22,276
Mike, you don't know
the damn words either.

1912
02:21:22,484 --> 02:21:25,654
Bad boys, bad boys
What you gonna do?

1913
02:21:25,904 --> 02:21:28,824
What you gonna do
When they come for you?

1914
02:21:25,904 --> 02:21:28,824
What you gonna do
When they come for you?

1915
02:21:25,904 --> 02:21:28,824
What you gonna do
When they come for you?
