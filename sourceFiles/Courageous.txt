1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Courageous

1
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,577
Hey! Hey, no! No! No. Hey, stop!

2
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,790
Get off, man. Get off.
No, stop the truck!

3
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,375
You trying to die?
No.

4
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,044
No. Stop the truck!

5
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,797
Let go, man. You trying to die?
Stop the car! Ah!

6
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,093
Stop the car!

7
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,513
Let go, dawg. Let go, dawg.
Don't!

8
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,816
Ah!
Let it go. Let it go.

9
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,161
Forget this, man. Let's go.

10
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,583
Hurry up, man.
This ain't worth it, dawg.
Come on.

11
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,418
Get in.

12
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,339
Sir. Sir. Are you okay?
Are you okay?

13
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,010
Just lay still.
We're calling for help.
We're getting help.

14
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,055
Don't worry about the car.
I'm not worried about the car.

15
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,732
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's okay.

16
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,611
There is a baby in the car.
Please hurry. ls he okay?

17
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,738
It's okay.

18
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,991
Yeah, l think it's his dad
that's with him.

19
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,913
Yeah, l think he's all right.
It's okay, it's okay.

20
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,211
Did you notice any other markings?
Maybe a tattoo?

21
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,213
No, sir. It happened so fast.

22
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,341
I think he had on a black do-rag
or something like that.

23
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,636
You know you could've lost your life.
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,430
But I couldn't risk losing my son.

25
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,268
I was hoping to meet you guys under
better circumstances on Monday.

26
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,522
Monday?
Yep. l start work with you next week.

27
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,653
Nathan Hayes. Kept wondering
how I recognized your name.

28
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,196
Adam Mitchell.
Hi.

29
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,865
Shane Fuller.
Hey, good to meet you.

30
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,367
Good to meet you.

31
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,452
So why Albany?

32
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,914
I wanted to move back to give
my family a better, slower pace.

33
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,501
Heh. I'd say welcome back,
but I hate to say it after a rotten day.

34
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,672
Well, my son is okay,
so l still say it's a good day.

35
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,600
So would you have held on
to the wheel?

36
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,021
Well, l can think of a few ways
he could've died,

37
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,649
but I guess he did
save his kid's life.

38
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,819
I don't know. Would you?

39
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,991
Four-four-five-five-zero.

40
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,689
Where have you been?

41
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,817
Working on reports.
Trying not to miss another deadline.

42
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,528
You missed
Emily's piano recital.

43
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,241
Totally forgot about that.

44
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,077
She asked if she could
stay up till you got home.

45
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,371
Dylan is out running.

46
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,875
When he gets back, he's gonna
ask you about that 5K race again.

47
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,753
I'm gonna say no again.
I tried to tell him that.

48
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,547
But he is determined that
he's gonna change your mind.

49
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,550
And here we go.

50
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,515
Hey, Dad. Can l talk to you?
As long as it's not about a 5K race.

51
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,727
Why not? Other guys are
running it with their dads.

52
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,771
You're already on the track team.

53
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,067
They hardly ever let me run.
I can't sign up unless
you run with me.

54
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,361
Doesn't bother me
that you like to run.

55
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,447
This is not the only 5K race.
There's gonna be others.

56
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,501
Can I suggest that you
spend more time with him?

57
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,128
All he wants to do is
play video games and run.

58
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,714
Well, then go run with him.

59
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,884
There's gotta be a better way
to spend time with him.

60
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,928
Well, you have got
to do something.

61
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,393
He can help me build the shed.
He's gonna see that as your project.

62
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,854
Besides, he's at school
most of the time anyway.

63
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,774
Hey, Daddy.

64
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,193
Hey, sweetheart.

65
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm sorry I missed your recital.
That's okay. l messed up three times.

66
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,157
You did?
Yeah.

67
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,328
But then Hannah Stuart messed up
four times, so I felt a little bit better.

68
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,788
You little stinker.

69
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,331
Oh, by the way,

70
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,001
Emily has been invited to
Hannah's birthday party next Friday.

71
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,004
But I told her she was gonna
have to ask you first.

72
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,631
Please. Please let me go.

73
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,676
I promise I'll do my chores
and my homework every day.

74
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,053
She committed any crimes
or misdemeanors lately?

75
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,222
Actually, no.
She's been very good.

76
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,350
She even cleaned her room
without me asking her.

77
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,562
Not by putting everything
in the closet, right?

78
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,023
Ah.

79
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,485
All right,
but you owe me a really big hug.

80
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,781
- Yes. Thank you, Daddy, thank you.
- All right, princess.

81
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,076
Too many birthday parties.
You have too many friends.

82
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,829
All right, you go on to bed.

83
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,338
I'm grilling steaks Saturday.
What are you gonna do?

84
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,049
Come over and eat one.
That's what l'm talking about.

85
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,260
You've got no life.
You come over too.

86
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,928
I've got a life, man.

87
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,180
What are you doing?

88
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,890
This Saturday?
Yeah.

89
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,185
Well, l mean,
I guess it depends if, um...

90
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,146
I mean--
Hey, I'll see you on Saturday.

91
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,107
All right.

92
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,568
If everyone's here, let's get started.

93
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,780
First things first, Deputy Thomson
has now survived his rookie year.

94
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,867
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

95
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,747
I guess that means you can
start using real bullets now.
Ha, ha.

96
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,208
I'm gonna see you out there.
Anytime.

97
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,585
I wanna introduce
Thomson's new partner.

98
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,505
His name's Nathan Hayes.
He'll be joining our shift.

99
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:31,218
He has eight years of experience
in Atlanta, but he's from here.

100
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,845
And we're glad you're here.
Let's welcome him.

101
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,351
Okay, guys,
we have two new warrants out today.

102
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,146
If you would pass those out.
Clyde and Jamar Holloman,

103
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,858
two frequent fliers who have
opened up a new drug operation

104
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,110
on the 600 block of Sheffield.

105
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,821
I'd like both warrant teams
to handle this one.

106
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,241
Everyone else,
stick to your normal beats.

107
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,868
The sheriff
has something to share.

108
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,579
Sheriff.
Thank you.

109
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,209
Had an e-mail
come across my desk
I'd like to share with you.

110
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,504
"A study was done on the increase
in violent gang activity.

111
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,216
In almost every case, each
gang member had a similar attribute.

112
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:16,721
Runaways, dropouts, kids on drugs,
and teens in prison.

113
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,308
That attribute is that most of them
came from a fatherless home.

114
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,895
To put it another way,
when a father's absent

115
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,567
kids are five times more likely
to commit suicide and abuse drugs,

116
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,195
twenty times more likely
to wind up in prison."

117
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,032
I know your shift work's hard,

118
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,743
and l know you see
the worst side of people.

119
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,205
But when you clock out,
go home and love your families.

120
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,251
All right, you're dismissed.
Get out of here.

121
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,549
Victoria, the truck with the lumber's
about to show up.

122
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,218
Just tell them to pile it
next to the driveway.

123
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,930
Right. Yeah, hold on.

124
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,058
Hey, that's the sheriff.
I gotta take this.

125
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,853
Okay. Love you. Bye.

126
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,188
Hey, sir.

127
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,565
Yes, sir.

128
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,359
We did that.

129
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,530
Thank you. We'll take care of it.
All right. Love you. Bye.

130
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,073
Oh, no, no, no.

131
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,457
Did you just tell the sheriff
that you loved him?

132
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,377
I can't believe l did that.
Should I call him back?

133
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,089
Why? To tell him that you don't?
Heh, heh, heh.

134
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:37,594
Six-93-C en route to the 600 block
of Sheffield, 1 0-99 reference.

135
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,264
Hey, five-0.

136
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,309
Yo, five-0, five-0.

137
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,663
Thomson, Hayes, you got the back?
Ten-four.

138
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,880
It's not them, but they're up to no good.
Yeah.

139
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,050
I got a feeling about this one.
I'm feeling it too.

140
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,219
You got the back door,
rookie?

141
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:23,056
Yeah, l'll take it.
I'm not a rookie anymore.

142
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,685
Who is it?

143
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,813
Sheriff's office.

144
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,691
Yeah?

145
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,069
We have a warrant for the arrest
of Clyde and Jamar Holloman.

146
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,240
I don't want nothing to do with this.
I ain't even supposed to be here.

147
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,080
Ready?

148
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,469
Clear.

149
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,607
They use the same interior decorator
you use, Shane.

150
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,443
Just watch my back, Mitchell.

151
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,278
Clear.

152
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,620
Shane.

153
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:54,189
Clyde and Jamar Holloman,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

154
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:58,318
We can do this
the easy way or the hard way.
I suggest you come down.

155
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,914
One, two, three.

156
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,127
Stairs.

157
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,592
This is your last chance.

158
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,762
Don't make this any harder
than it needs to be.

159
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,399
What are you doing up here?

160
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,111
Uncle Clyde told me to walk
around here until he gets back.

161
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,698
Come on down.

162
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,660
That's them.

163
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,328
Back door! Back door!

164
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,001
Get in the car.

165
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,301
Thomson, stay with them.
No lights, no lights.

166
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,902
Ah!

167
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,367
Shane. 600 block is uphill north.
North.

168
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,536
Copy that.

169
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,547
- 400 block of Hartford.
- 400 block of Hartford.

170
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,383
David, help me out.
Where's Hartford?

171
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,732
Switch.

172
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,827
Officer in foot pursuit,
300 block of Oakview, northbound.

173
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,287
David, where are you?

174
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,498
Oakview?
I haven't even found Hartford yet.

175
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,225
I'm getting too old for this.

176
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,499
David, where are you?
I'm headed to Whitley.

177
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,064
Always gotta be the hard way,
doesn't it?

178
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,361
Oh, look at what we have here.

179
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,614
You're just digging a deeper hole
for yourself, aren't you?

180
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,034
Adam, I got the suspect, 1 0-95.
Help Nathan if you can.

181
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,496
Ten-four. Good job, Shane.

182
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,593
Where is he?
Headed back up toward Sheffield.

183
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,345
All right.

184
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,268
- There he is, there he is.
- I got him.

185
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,187
Slingshot?
Let's do it.

186
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,740
Give me your hands.

187
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,451
How far you gonna make me
chase you, man?

188
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,661
I'm getting too old for this.

189
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,504
You got some wheels, man.
But I'm out of gas. Hoo.

190
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,143
Welcome to the party.
You go out for a burger?

191
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,021
Should've got pulled over
for driving too slow.

192
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,857
Hey, I got Jamar in the back.
I'm really sorry.

193
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,319
- I got turned around. lt was my bad.
- They don't pay us enough.

194
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,781
They ought to give us a bonus
for catching them on foot.

195
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,241
Look, man,
you gotta learn the streets.

196
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,701
I needed you.

197
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,287
Look, it's not gonna happen again.

198
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,452
Hey, Javi, boss wants
to see you in the trailer.

199
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,255
- I'm gonna get you, Marcos.
- No, you're not.

200
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,675
Isabel! Marcos! Stop running.

201
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,011
Pick up these toys!
I need to start lunch.

202
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,596
Not rice and beans.

203
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,225
You show me a clean room
and l'll think about it.

204
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,981
How can you have anything else?
Rice and beans is all you have.

205
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,485
Javi?

206
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:19,448
What are you doing home?
Why aren't you at work?

207
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,412
They let me go.
What? Why?

208
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,622
I was last hired.
They went over budget.

209
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,625
Why didn't you call me?
I could have talked to them.

210
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,879
We've got two children to feed.
I tried to tell him that.

211
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:37,133
But it made no difference.
We owe $400 in a week, Javi.

212
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,719
All I have is rice and beans
to feed the kids.

213
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,931
Marcos needs shoes.
I tried to tell him, Carmen.

214
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,184
I'm trying.

215
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,607
Look.

216
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,444
Here's $300.

217
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,071
Get whatever you need
for the children.

218
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,116
I'll go out and look for work.
Javi, wait.

219
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,246
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to react that way.

220
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,500
Why don't you take the car?
We'll walk to the store.

221
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,795
I'm not gonna drive
while my family walks.

222
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,135
Carmen, I've asked God for help.

223
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,429
He will find me work.

224
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,351
Do you have anything
I can take with me to eat?

225
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,772
A tortilla.

226
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,203
Tell Jordan to get out of my room.
He won't leave my stuff alone.

227
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,497
- I'm not bothering her.
- Yes, you are.

228
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,960
Jordan, I told you five minutes
ago to brush your teeth
and put your p.j.'s on.

229
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,629
- Now, do I have to get Mr. Pow-Pow?
- No, ma'am.

230
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,258
Well, let's start moving
in that direction.
Quick, quick, quick.

231
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,594
I don't want you up all night
texting that boy. You hear me?

232
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,554
We need to know
more about him

233
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,808
before you even think
about developing feelings
for him.

234
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,309
Hey, what boy?

235
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,437
Another saggy-pants boy
is interested in Jade.

236
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,314
But this time he's 1 7.

237
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,986
Mom, it's not that big of a deal.
It is a big deal when you're only 1 5.

238
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,281
Here, hold this.
Is this someone you met at school?

239
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,534
Yes. He's nice, though.
His grandmother goes
to Mount Zion.

240
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,870
Does he go to Mount Zion too?
I think, when she takes him.

241
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,165
His parents don't go to church?
He lives with his grandma.

242
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,460
Has he asked you out?
Yes.

243
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,046
Jade, come on,
we already talked about this.

244
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,340
You can't go on a date
till they talk to me.

245
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,884
They have no business talking
to me until you're 1 7.

246
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,804
It's not a real date.
We're just going
to the mall.

247
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:51,058
If a boy has asked you
to go anywhere with him,
it's a date.

248
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,648
Nathan, it's Adam Mitchell.

249
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,610
Trying to kill me? That is nasty.
You're not supposed to be eating it.

250
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,489
My car should be ready
in a couple days.

251
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,782
Not a problem.

252
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,161
That shirt's a problem.

253
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,705
Heh, heh, heh.
You don't like my shirt?

254
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,914
Ugh.

255
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,667
Emily, what do you think of my shirt?
I love it.

256
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,420
Your daughter loves my shirt.
My daughter's 9.

257
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,757
Okay. Well, Tyler thought
it was cool, so I got it.

258
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,343
Your 12-year-old son's giving you
fashion advice?

259
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,762
Well, l see no one gives you
fashion advice.

260
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,641
- How is Tyler?
- Oh, he's good.

261
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,561
I only get him every other weekend,
and even then

262
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,940
it's only after Mia's filled his head
with her toxic opinions of me.

263
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,111
A third of my pay goes to alimony.
Let's talk about this later.

264
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,988
Why? What's alimony?

265
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,908
It's a, uh, real bad condition
Mr. Shane has.

266
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,827
- It makes him wear ugly clothes.
- Hey.

267
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,624
You know what I like about you?
What?

268
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,419
Oh, yeah. Never mind.
I was thinking of somebody else.

269
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,176
# Your love is all that I needed #
# lt's all l ever needed ##

270
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,678
All right,
I'm just staying here on the curb.

271
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,889
You got five minutes,
cabana boy.

272
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,185
Hey, can you bring me a lollipop?
Yes, l will, sweetheart.

273
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,270
I'm not getting you one.

274
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,442
Oh, Daddy, turn it up. I love this song.

275
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,403
Oh, l've heard this before.
Who is it?

276
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,280
No, sweetie,
what are you doing?

277
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,242
Come dance with me.
This is a parking lot.

278
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,578
This is not where people dance.
Just for this song. Please?

279
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,039
Emily, people can see us.
That's okay.

280
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,916
They don't care,
Daddy. Please?

281
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,336
Tell you what.
You dance right here
and l'll watch.

282
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,674
Okay.

283
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,968
# And oh, oh, oh, oh #

284
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,555
Okay, when you're ready to dance,
this is what you do.

285
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:57,017
First you put your right hand
around my waist like this.

286
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,563
Then you hold your
other hand out like this.

287
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,233
Then we sway back and forth
to the music.

288
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,572
# When we're together #

289
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,158
Heh.

290
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,952
And you can spin.

291
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,665
Are you sure
you don't wanna dance?

292
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,918
# l'd like a castle on a hill #

293
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,337
I'm dancing with you
in my heart, sweetie.

294
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,048
# Where you and I
Could spend the day #

295
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,345
# And I'd love to go
Where time stands still #

296
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,473
Trying to teach your dad
how to dance?

297
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,183
He won't dance with me.

298
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,895
That's because he's a fuddy-duddy
with no sense of style.

299
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,440
All right, everybody in the car.
Mr. Fuddy-Duddy's leaving.

300
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,569
# And oh, oh, oh, oh #

301
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,779
Your Highness.
Thank you.

302
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,200
Emily, who taught you to dance?
I know it wasn't your father.

303
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,869
Hey, I dance at home with my wife.

304
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,997
Because she's too embarrassed
to dance with you in public?

305
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,041
You could be walking right now.
Heh, heh.

306
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,335
But I'm not.

307
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,048
# When we're together ##

308
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,511
Oh!

309
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,472
No way you're doing that again.
Watch me.

310
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,642
You want me to line nine more up
like l did last time?

311
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,852
They want to know
what we're talking about.

312
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,981
We're not talking about anything.
Hey, man, that steak was great.

313
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,194
Thing tastes just like my dad's.
That guy used to grill out all the time.

314
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,112
Yeah, mine too.

315
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,448
Hey, speaking of dads...

316
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,618
That e-mail the sheriff read,
you think that was accurate?

317
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,747
I do. l grew up seeing
that kind of stuff all the time.

318
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,041
I wonder where
all the good fathers went.

319
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,918
Ain't that the truth?

320
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,379
What? I remember you talking
about your dad.

321
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:52,424
Wasn't he an usher at your church?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.

322
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:56,220
Soon as the church service started,
he'd step out back for a smoke.

323
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:01,267
You know, one time he says to me,
"I better not catch you drinking."

324
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,727
Had a beer in his hand
when he said it.

325
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:08,566
My mom used to nag him.
That is, till they got divorced.

326
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:13,404
Look, it's not like l don't love the guy,
but it's hard to respect a hypocrite.

327
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,283
What about you, David?

328
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,952
Um...

329
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,830
I had a good dad.

330
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,250
I guess.
I mean, the guy wasn't perfect.

331
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,961
My parents split
after he had an affair.

332
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,047
But I think he regretted it.

333
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,218
I struggled with it, but, you know,
divorce comes with the territory now.

334
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,722
I disagree, man. Divorce happens
because you make it an option.

335
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,726
You don't know what's gonna
happen. People change.

336
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,354
You can't always work stuff out.
Sometimes you need to part ways.

337
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,773
- I think I agree with Nathan.
- Thank you.

338
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,569
People don't fight for marriage.
Right. Wait till you get married.

339
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,864
You're gonna figure out real quick
how much you don't know.

340
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,992
If it wasn't for my faith in God,
I'd be in a tailspin.

341
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,619
Yeah, me too.
Hm.

342
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,830
Look, guys,
not everyone believes in that stuff.

343
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,835
You guys are religious,
but you can't think religion's
the only way to live.

344
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,253
Religious?

345
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,798
It didn't work out for your parents.
Didn't they get a divorce?

346
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,301
That's the problem.
They were never married.

347
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:22,931
Listen, my dad had six children
from three different women.

348
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,267
And l was the fifth child.

349
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,479
Before I was born,
he had already left.

350
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:34,151
I'm 37 years old, and l've never
met my biological father.

351
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,946
Looks like you turned out all right.

352
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,450
That's because a man
in my neighborhood
named William Barrett

353
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:45,162
mentored me as a teenager.
Taught me about God.

354
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,041
Every Father's Day,
he's the one that I call.

355
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,253
I'm telling you, man,
not having a father as a child, man,

356
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,256
scarred me in more ways
than I can count.

357
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:04,264
I've enjoyed our little heart-to-heart,
but I need to take off and pay bills

358
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,184
while there's still something left
of my paycheck.

359
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,853
Speaking of paycheck,
I talked to my man Javier.

360
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,564
The guy did a phenomenal job
on my deck.

361
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,359
He's available next week,
but he wants 1 50 a day.

362
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,072
Call him. Gotta have somebody
who knows what they're doing.

363
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,867
I'm taking vacation time.
I gotta get it done. So 8:00 Monday.

364
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,704
Okay. l'll call him.

365
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,707
See you boys in church tomorrow.

366
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,711
All right, let's see it.

367
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,714
Oh!

368
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,174
I told you. Heh, heh.
All right.

369
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,137
Yes, sir, I could be there today.

370
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,391
Great. Thank you very much.
I'll be there as soon as l can.

371
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,143
Goodbye.

372
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,568
Who were you talking to?
I got a job, but l need to leave now.

373
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,362
They're building a new office.
They need more men.

374
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,323
Thank God, Javi.
The rent is due on Friday.

375
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,869
I'd tell you to take the car,
but the tank is on empty.

376
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,538
I don't mind walking
when l have good news.

377
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,500
Carmen, I told you,
God would give me a job.

378
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,505
I'd give you a big kiss
on the mouth,

379
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,508
but your breath is very bad
this morning.

380
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,012
I love you too.

381
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,681
Ay.

382
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,477
I need that pile moved over there,
you understand?

383
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,979
All right, what are we waiting on?
Let's go.

384
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,647
Sir, are you Richard?
Yeah.

385
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,817
My name's Javier Martinez.
I was told to see you for work.

386
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,445
I just hired the last
three guys l need. Sorry.

387
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,907
I can do most anything, sir.
Woodwork, brickwork.
Even drywall.

388
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,742
Man, l said l got what I need.

389
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,077
Unless someone quits,
I don't need you.

390
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,062
I don't understand, Lord.

391
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:20,484
I've been trying to do everything
possible to provide for my family.

392
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,821
And l have needed your help.

393
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,074
But you don't help me.

394
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:32,287
I told my family that you would
help us... That you would provide.

395
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:37,459
What do I tell them?
That we're going to lose our house?

396
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,633
What do you want me to do?

397
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,313
Hey. Javier.

398
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,864
What are you doing?

399
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,743
I'm not paying you $1 50
to stand in the street.

400
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,620
Let's go.

401
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,959
Adam, be nice.

402
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,253
He's late
and just standing in the alley.

403
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,213
You don't know him.
You need his help.

404
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,300
You better start off on the right foot.
All right.

405
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,512
Javier, right?

406
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,806
- Yes.
- Adam Mitchell.

407
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,475
Didn't mean to yell.
I should've come out and talked.

408
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,270
- This is my wife, Victoria.
- Nice to meet you.

409
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,439
Let me go get you a water.

410
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,734
Got the plans for the shed here.
My old one's falling apart.

411
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,569
You didn't bring any tools?

412
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,906
No.
All right, we'll just have to share.

413
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,367
I don't mean to put you on the spot,
but you got a work permit?

414
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,953
Yes, l do.
Good.

415
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,039
Let me show you what we're doing.

416
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,882
"He gave her blue eyes
and blond, wavy hair.

417
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,509
He gave her a cute
but devilish grin."

418
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,221
- Javi, is that you?
- It's me.

419
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,932
Oh, it's Papi.

420
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,814
Yes, read us a story, read us a story.
Okay, lsabel.

421
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,318
Let Daddy get cleaned up and eat.
I've got a special story for you.

422
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,320
- Come, kids.
- And you too, buddy.

423
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:33,283
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Off to bed, off to bed.
Let Daddy eat.

424
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,832
So? How did it go today?

425
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,793
Terrible.

426
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,880
Then wonderful.
What is that supposed to mean?

427
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,550
I went to that job this morning,
and they said they didn't need me.

428
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,387
So where have you been all day?
That's the thing.

429
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,556
I was walking home, asking God
what he wanted me to do,

430
00:32:56,724 --> 00:33:00,852
when this guy comes out
of his house and starts
calling me by name.

431
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,481
Then he asked me to go help him
build a shed. Look.

432
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,276
You made $1 50 today?
Yes.

433
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,698
How did he know you?
I have no idea.

434
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,284
And why didn't you ask him?
I was scared.

435
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,205
Are you going back tomorrow?
Eight o'clock.

436
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:28,130
Carmen, few times have I ever felt
that God was helping my faith.

437
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,590
But today was one of them.

438
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,678
It felt so good to work hard.

439
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,598
Javi, l know God loves you.

440
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,935
He listens to you
because you honor him.

441
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:46,273
And all l wanna do right now
is to hug you and kiss you.

442
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,404
But you smell so bad,
I can't bring myself to do it.

443
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,991
Give me 1 5 minutes.

444
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,952
I'll heat up your dinner,
mi amor.

445
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,374
It was a day of sadness and joy
for Mr. and Mrs. James Turner

446
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,462
of 1 1th Avenue as they watched
their home nearly burn
to the ground.

447
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,632
The fire started from an
electrical outlet and spread
through the house.

448
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,051
The Turners escaped,

449
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,637
not knowing that their 7-year-old
daughter, Lacey, was inside.

450
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,683
Dylan, you need to run earlier.
Ten-thirty's too late for you to be out.

451
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,019
I just knew they were dead.

452
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,897
- We live across the street.
- We could feel the flames.

453
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,275
The heat was intense.
We're so excited the girl
got out okay.

454
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,569
- Emily, sweetie, come on.
- Let's go to bed.

455
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,448
We practice for these things
all the time, but every fire is different.

456
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,118
- I'm just glad everybody got out alive.
- There's that little bird--

457
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,204
has been busy. I don't know why--

458
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,290
We're gonna have some--
One of the big--

459
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,918
--kneecap.
--it would cost--

460
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,253
for her to be able to drive in any...

461
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,890
Get him!

462
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,893
- Get him!
- Get him! Get him!

463
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:10,440
- All right, that's it. That's enough.
- That's it. I said, that's it.

464
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,582
You did good, little G.

465
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,130
So-- Unh. So l'm in?

466
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,216
Yeah, you in.

467
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,385
Now that I ain't got Clyde
and Jamar,

468
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,179
I'm gonna have you
making those runs for me.

469
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,474
Let me tell you something.
This pain you think you feeling?

470
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:49,312
Ain't nothing compared
to what we'll do if you try
to leave or turn on one of us.

471
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,401
Twon, get him up, man.

472
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,124
You family now.

473
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,753
Family.

474
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,969
You know what I'm saying?
Family, boy.

475
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,439
- There he is.
- Hey.

476
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,065
Hey.

477
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,901
How's it going?

478
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,779
I hope you're enjoying your vacation.
You missed a nasty fight on 9th.

479
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,489
Oh, yeah. That guy was crazy.

480
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,327
Vacation? l've been spending
all day working on my shed.

481
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,496
Sorry about Javier not showing up.
I meant to call you.

482
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,249
He was in the hospital.
He's got kidney stones.

483
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,877
What? He's been helping me
for three days.

484
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,589
I'm talking about my friend Javier.
That's who I'm talking about.

485
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,133
Showed up Monday,
been working like a machine.

486
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,802
That's impossible.
The guy's in the hospital.

487
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,847
He's at my house right now.
I left him 1 0 minutes ago.

488
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,268
You're out of your mind.
The guy's got, like,
tubes and IVs. No.

489
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,937
What does Javier look like?

490
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,232
I don't know. He's like 6'2",
thin as a rail, goatee.

491
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,401
No, no, no. I'd say maybe 5'1 0",
stocky, clean-shaven.

492
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,903
Look, guys, look, guys.

493
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,531
I'm not a genius,
but you aren't talking
about the same dude.

494
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,660
I'm thinking the same thing.
I mean, I figured that out.

495
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,497
Adam, I don't know
who's at your house,
but it ain't Javier.

496
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,543
Dude. He's at your house
right now?

497
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,837
By himself?

498
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,506
Talk to you guys later.

499
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,842
Hey, hey, we ordered for you.
Who's gonna pay for this?

500
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,689
Hey.
Back from lunch already?

501
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,025
Javier, what's your name?
Javier.

502
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,238
No, no, no. What's your full name?
Javier Eduardo Martinez.

503
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,616
What's your full name?
Adam Thomas Mitchell.

504
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,327
You know Shane Fuller?
Shane Fuller?

505
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,162
No. What's his full name?

506
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,293
No, no, no. Who told you
I was building a shed?

507
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,961
You did.

508
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,047
Who told you l'd give you 1 50 a day?
You did.

509
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,509
What?
How did you know to call me "Javier"?

510
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,762
Thought your name was Javier.
It is.

511
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,932
Why were you standing
in my alley Monday?

512
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,311
Because I needed a job.
Why did you ask me to help?

513
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,230
Because I thought you were
a guy named Javier.

514
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,523
I am.

515
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,280
You don't have a problem
with your kidneys, do you?

516
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,824
No.

517
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,454
Do you?
No.

518
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,002
I don't understand this.

519
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,089
What l can tell you is
by you giving me this job,

520
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,759
it has been an answer
to my family's prayers.

521
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,764
Well, you're doing good work.

522
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,266
Sure I can't get you anything to eat?
No.

523
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,518
My wife's lunch
was big enough already.

524
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:19,397
All right, l'll be back in a bit.
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

525
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,858
You're hungry again already?

526
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,492
Hey, how you doing?
What's up?

527
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,914
What happened to your face?
What? Oh, this? It's nothing.

528
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,375
I was just playing around
with some friends.

529
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,335
Anyway, check out my ride.

530
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,295
Is that your car?

531
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,965
No, it's a friend's, but l can
drive it pretty much whenever.

532
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,844
I really came to see if you wanted
to go get something to eat with me.

533
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,764
I don't know.
I'd have to ask my dad and see--

534
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,308
Hey, Jade, dinner's almost ready.

535
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,061
Hello, how are you?
I'm good.

536
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,939
You must be Jade's father.
I am.

537
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,651
And you are?
Daddy, this is my friend Derrick.

538
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,278
Nice to meet you.
You just in the neighborhood?

539
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,323
I came to see if Jade wanted
to get something to eat.

540
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,118
I'll bring her back later.
Hm.

541
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,621
Jade, go in the house.
I'll be in in a few minutes.

542
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,333
Thanks for coming over, Derrick.
I guess I'll just see you later.

543
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,087
Let me talk to you for a minute.

544
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,427
I appreciate your interest
in my daughter.

545
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,887
But we're not allowing her
to go out on dates.

546
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,723
This ain't really a date.
We're just trying to hang out.

547
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:40,019
Mm-hm. lt's important that
she be older and for us
to know who she's with.

548
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,773
You got a problem with me?
Look, we just don't know you, okay?

549
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,817
Any man interested
in my daughter

550
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,695
needs to explain the purpose
of the relationship.

551
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,824
The purpose? It ain't like
I'm gonna take advantage
of a 1 5-year-old girl.

552
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,284
Oh, l agree.

553
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,246
If you'd like to get to know us better,
join us for lunch on Sunday.

554
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,291
We'd be happy to have you.
I don't know.

555
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,043
How'd you get that bruise
on your face?

556
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,505
You know what?
That's none of your business.

557
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,800
You should let Jade
make her own decisions.

558
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,057
I do not like that boy.
He is very disrespectful.

559
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,186
How can he be respectful
when Daddy runs him off?

560
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,856
Listen. lf he shows no respect for us,
he won't respect you either.

561
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,192
- That's right.
- Baby, you've gotta trust us.

562
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,779
That boy has a lot of
growing up to do. We'd better
go eat while it's still hot.

563
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,490
Come on, let's go to the table.

564
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,699
I'm not hungry.

565
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,368
Well, l'd still like for you
to sit with us.

566
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,126
So your wife
homeschools your kids?

567
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,170
For now.

568
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,007
It's important that we
give them a good foundation
when they're young.

569
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,675
Seems good.

570
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,638
You have two kids?
I do.

571
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,223
Nail gun?
Please.

572
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,808
Emily's my sweet 9-year-old,

573
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,649
and Dylan is
my stubborn 1 5-year-old.

574
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,319
Well, l think he's just
going through a stage.

575
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,321
You can meet him
when he comes home.

576
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,448
I think Emily's at a birthday party.

577
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,120
So l had this thought.

578
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,793
Know that thread factory on Clark?
Yeah.

579
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,171
I know the guys that run it.

580
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,383
If you'd like, I can talk to them
about getting you a job.

581
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,511
You mean like a full-time job?
Why not?

582
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,681
I'd recommend you.
I would be very grateful.

583
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,605
Adam, I need you
to come with me now.

584
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:51,776
What's wrong?
Emily. She's been in a wreck.

585
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,665
God be with them.

586
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,252
Talk to me, Shane.

587
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,505
Emily was picked up after school
by the Martins.

588
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:17,176
Their SUV was hit by a drunk driver
at a four-way stop on Emily's side.

589
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,848
Nathan went to get Victoria.
It doesn't look good, Adam.

590
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,350
I'm sorry, man.

591
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,646
Oh, God, help my daughter.

592
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,941
Please, Lord.

593
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,100
At a moment like this

594
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,896
silence seems to be
the only expression that fits.

595
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,527
What can we, as mere men,
say to a grieving and shattered heart?

596
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:22,033
We speak today
because we have a living hope.

597
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,161
Death is no respecter of persons.

598
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,705
Death is no respecter of youth.

599
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,541
Death is a painful intruder

600
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,961
and a pernicious reminder
of our human condition.

601
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:40,218
But I stand before you today
to declare that we have a living hope

602
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,596
and that causes us
to rejoice greatly.

603
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,099
You see, our hope today is found

604
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,060
in the fact that Jesus
is no longer entombed.

605
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:53,523
He lives.
And because he lives, Emily lives.

606
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,860
Because he lives,
the grieving broken heart has hope

607
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,697
and reason to rejoice.

608
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,885
Make sense of this for me.

609
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,018
I feel like...

610
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,813
I'm in a fog...

611
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,817
or some type of black hole.

612
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,448
And l really wanna get out.

613
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:36,584
I mean, were we wrong
to let her go to that party?

614
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,130
If l had said no,
she'd still be here.

615
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,257
Victoria.

616
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,010
We can't do that.

617
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,513
Why is she the one
that had to get killed

618
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,015
and why is that drunk still alive?

619
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,060
Why? Why?

620
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,622
There's so many things
I didn't say.

621
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,213
I should've been a better father.

622
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,304
No.

623
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,934
You're still a father.

624
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,162
How'd you get in here?

625
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,167
I know how to open a lock, Dylan.

626
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,296
Calling me or something?

627
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,593
Just wanted to see
how you were doing.

628
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,849
Is anybody doing okay
around here?

629
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,563
Is there anything
you wanna talk about?

630
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,567
Why do you wanna talk?

631
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,781
Everyone who comes into this house
just keeps saying the same thing
over and over.

632
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,952
They're just trying to help, son.

633
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,455
They're not.

634
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,381
Dylan, we're all hurting.

635
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,511
What we can't do
is block each other out.

636
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,263
We need each other.

637
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,685
You don't need me.

638
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,235
Can I play my game now?

639
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,704
Yes.

640
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,637
Adam?

641
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,394
I'll never get to see her graduate.

642
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,025
I'll never get to walk her
down the aisle.

643
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:58,030
Adam, don't.
Don't go there.

644
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,704
How am l supposed to let her go?

645
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,215
I should've danced with her.

646
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,261
Why didn't l dance with her?

647
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,825
Pastor, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

648
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,118
You're welcome, Adam.

649
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,830
I'm so sorry for
what you and Victoria
have been going through.

650
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,418
I can't make sense of anything,
you know?

651
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,588
Ahem. And, um...

652
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,550
And l guess l kind of feel
like l'm in the dark.

653
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,890
And l wanna be there for Victoria,

654
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,185
but my emotions
are all over the place.

655
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,646
So l don't know what to do.

656
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:17,359
Well, Adam, there needs
to be a grieving process.

657
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,031
And the Lord is the one
who carries you through it.

658
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,325
And it takes time.

659
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,952
It takes time for healing.

660
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,956
Healing?

661
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,127
I've heard many people say,
who have lost a loved one

662
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:39,632
that in some ways it's like learning
to live with an amputation.

663
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:45,346
You do heal,
but you're never the same.

664
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,057
But I would also say

665
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,895
that those who go through this
and trust in the Lord,

666
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,898
discover a comfort
and an intimacy with God

667
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:59,235
that most people
never experience.

668
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,865
I...

669
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,076
I wanna trust him.

670
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,205
I just don't understand
what he's doing.

671
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:16,543
Well, he doesn't promise
an explanation.

672
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:20,839
But he does promise to walk
with us through the pain.

673
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,843
And the hard choice for you

674
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:29,598
is whether you're gonna be angry
for the time you didn't have with her,

675
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,434
or grateful for the time
that you did have.

676
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,487
I don't wanna be angry.

677
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,367
I wanna heal.

678
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,162
How would you like for me
to help you?

679
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,339
I wanna know what God expects
of me as a father.

680
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,262
And l wanna know
how to help my wife and my son.

681
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,473
Okay.

682
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,700
You'd think you were going
for a doctorate.

683
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,744
I feel like it.

684
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,705
Where's Dylan?
Oh, he's getting a shower.

685
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,041
Ran another five miles.

686
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,793
Says he already needs
new running shoes.

687
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,671
I'm gonna go to the store, okay?
All right.

688
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:51,138
I don't think l could run five miles.
Well, who says you have to?

689
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,891
I've been thinking
about running with him.

690
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,142
Really?

691
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:00,814
I'm accepting the fact I have to learn
how to do the hard things.

692
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:05,527
I've never enjoyed running,
but it is the best way
to spend time with him.

693
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:10,407
Well, how is your research coming?
Sobering.

694
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,870
I've been doing about
half of what I should've
been doing as a dad.

695
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:20,167
And there is so much in scripture
about being a father.

696
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,753
I never took time to look it up.

697
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,550
It's the sheriff.

698
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,261
Hello, sir.

699
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,722
Yes, sir.

700
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,517
We did.

701
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,188
We turned that in yesterday.
Adam. Adam, bye.

702
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,565
Love you.
Thank you, sir. We will.

703
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,901
Love you. Bye.

704
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,446
Okay.

705
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,867
Hello?

706
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,745
Sir?

707
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,331
Adam!

708
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:06,338
Hey.

709
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,632
Got a lot of homework?

710
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,968
Not really.

711
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,471
Got your learner's permit?

712
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,266
Why?

713
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:23,105
I need you to drive me to the mall,
get you some new running shoes.

714
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,316
If you don't mind,
I might get a pair for myself.

715
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,278
Are you serious?

716
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,323
Oh, ho, ho.

717
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,799
Hey, Javi, glad you could come.

718
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,010
Oh, thanks for the invitation.

719
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,180
I've never been in the back
of a police car before.

720
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,141
How's my other Javier friend?
You liking the new job?

721
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,101
Yes, very much.
Thanks to Adam.

722
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,812
SO to 6-93C.

723
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,606
Six-93-C. Go ahead.

724
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,484
Deputies need assistance
in reference to a 1 0-95

725
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,570
at the intersection
of Plantation and Foxfire.

726
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,448
Six-93-C en route.

727
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,492
It's gonna be gang-related.
Yeah.

728
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,161
Javi, we'll get to lunch
right after we do this.

729
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,664
If l tell you to get down, you stay low.
Okay.

730
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,208
What kind of gang is this?

731
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,960
They're all jail prep programs,
if you ask me.

732
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,338
And they're all dangerous.

733
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,673
You know,
I started a gang once.

734
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:37,137
You were in a gang?
We were the Snake Kings. Heh, heh.

735
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,139
Snake Kings?
Yes.

736
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,183
We had snakes
in our neighborhood

737
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,519
so we would throw rocks
and try to kill them.

738
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,187
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Okay.

739
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:49,650
So how many were in your gang?
Only three. My brothers and I.

740
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,568
So did you kill any snakes?

741
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,111
One.
Ha, ha, ha.

742
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,864
We thought we were heroes.
Ha, ha, ha.

743
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,415
All right. Javi, you just hang out
right here, all right?

744
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,833
Sure.

745
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,929
- What do you got?
- We got three.

746
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,266
Possession
with intent to distribute,
possession, possession.

747
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,268
He's a little belligerent.

748
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:27,521
I need you to go 1 0-95 to the jail
with one of them for me.

749
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,856
I need to separate them.
Can you swing it?

750
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,901
We can do that.
All right. Appreciate it.

751
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,156
Not with Javi
in the back.

752
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,121
Wait here. I got an idea.

753
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,878
- Javi, l need a favor.
- What's that?

754
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,926
You heard of the Snake Kings?
The who?

755
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,761
Snake Kings.
You ever crossed them?

756
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,471
I ain't heard of no Snake Kings.

757
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,889
We got their leader.

758
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:05,809
If he tries to cut you,
you yell, we'll stop the car.

759
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,186
I ain't getting in the back
with no killer.

760
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:12,149
Stay on your side. Don't look at him,
don't talk to him, you'll be fine.

761
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:16,903
Martinez, you hurt this guy,
I'll put you under the jail,
you got it?

762
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,197
Don't touch him.
All right, get in.

763
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,825
I don't wanna be in the car
with no Snake King.

764
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,828
Hey, they got a lot of room up there.
Get in the car.

765
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,122
Stay on your side.
We will protect you.

766
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,166
You're nuts.
Roll with it.

767
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,377
This goes south, all you.
All you.

768
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,379
All right.

769
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,012
Heh.

770
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,769
Dispatch, this is 6-93-C.
We're 1 0-95 en route to the jail.

771
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,897
1 0 to 12 minutes.

772
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:07,329
We are going to lunch.

773
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:11,750
I am getting a chicken sandwich.

774
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:21,426
And a lemonade.

775
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,720
Hey, man.
Hey, what's he saying, man?

776
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:27,307
Hey, man, just don't talk to him.
You stay on your side.

777
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,311
I may even get...

778
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,856
some waffle fries.

779
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,361
And a milkshake!

780
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,154
Hey, man, he's threatening me.

781
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,699
- I think he wants to kill me.
- Just calm down.

782
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,160
If he wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

783
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,169
Hey, he's free! Hey, he's free!

784
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,172
- Hey, stop the car! Stop the car! Stop!
- Snake King!

785
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,466
- Hey, stop the car!
- Stop the car!

786
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,594
He's trying to kill me! Stop the car!
Let me out! Hey, help!

787
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:10,475
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
- Heh, heh. Snake King.

788
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,896
Oh, it was the funniest
thing I've ever seen.

789
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,690
Oh, my.
Oh, man.

790
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,736
I've never seen somebody
so anxious to get to jail.

791
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,612
Oh, he is so crazy.

792
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,575
The guys like him.

793
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,369
We've kind of adopted him
into our group.

794
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:34,875
I mean, I still can't believe
Carmen brought us three meals
after the funeral.

795
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,752
I mean, that was so sweet.

796
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,962
Mm.

797
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,262
I had a good day today.

798
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,979
You all right, buddy?

799
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,238
We're gonna be okay,
aren't we?

800
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,410
We're gonna be all right.

801
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,507
I wish I would've been
a better brother.

802
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,354
It's all right.

803
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:45,821
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. l'm sorry.

804
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,699
Sorry.

805
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,119
Hey, I love you, buddy.

806
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,790
You are my son.

807
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:02,963
And l'm proud of you.
Don't you ever forget that, okay?

808
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,632
Don't you ever forget that.

809
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,844
It's okay. It's okay.

810
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:29,948
All right. lf everybody's stuffed,
I'm gonna tell you why
I had you come.

811
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,534
It isn't because
you just can't get enough of us?

812
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,995
Sorry, no.

813
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,789
I'm gonna ask you a favor.

814
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,710
Javi.

815
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,338
Resolution?
Yeah.

816
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:50,969
For a while now, l've been struggling
with what kind of dad l was to Emily.

817
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:55,140
What kind of father l'm being to Dylan.
You're being too hard on yourself.

818
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,268
You've been a good-enough father.
That's just it.

819
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,396
I don't wanna be
a "good-enough" father.

820
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,065
We have a few short years
to influence our kids.

821
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:08,111
Whatever patterns we set for them
will be used for their kids

822
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,405
and the generation after that.

823
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,741
We have the responsibility
to mold a life.

824
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,577
I don't think
that should be done casually.

825
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,079
Half the fathers in this country
are failing.

826
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,373
- I don't wanna be one of them.
- Okay.

827
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,418
I'm all for spending time
with our kids,

828
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,171
but don't you think
you're taking this too far?

829
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,840
It goes way beyond
spending time with your kids.

830
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,216
That should be a given.

831
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:35,263
I'm talking about
setting the standards that
they need to aim for in life.

832
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,390
What kind of standards?

833
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,438
Well, when did you first
think of yourself as a man?

834
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,565
What?

835
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,567
- Heh.
- No, no, no.

836
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,570
I mean, when did you first think,
"I'm a man now"?

837
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,949
Ha, ha.
Come on, you can't be serious.
We are not talking about this.

838
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:57,744
No, just humor me for a second.
Think about it.

839
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,247
Maybe when l moved out.

840
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,500
Or when l turned 21 .
I don't know.

841
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,085
- When you were legal?
- Yeah.

842
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,671
What about you, Shane?

843
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,967
I don't know.
I mean, when l got my license.

844
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,595
Or my first job.
I mean, what does it matter?

845
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,930
Javi?

846
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,350
When my father told me l was.

847
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:24,479
When I was 1 7, he had to leave
for three months to do a job.

848
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:28,441
He told me that
he thought of me as a man.

849
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,611
He wanted me
to take care of the family.

850
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:37,575
I'm learning that God wants me
to call out the man in my son.

851
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:41,037
I can't do that lightly.
I can't be passive about that.

852
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,916
I got these things
from studying scripture.

853
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:48,670
I wanna sign this as a resolution
of what kind of father l wanna be.

854
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,673
I'm giving you guys permission
to keep me accountable.

855
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,843
Can I sign this too?

856
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,849
Fine. Adam, if you're gonna do this,
maybe we should all just sign it.

857
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,102
No, no, no. I'm not asking
you guys to sign anything.

858
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:07,731
I need this. Dylan needs this.

859
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,192
If you wanna sign it,
take a few days to think about it.

860
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,986
I'm not doing this lightly.

861
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,291
And you're saying
you wanna do this too?

862
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,001
That's what l'm saying.

863
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,838
I thought I was good enough because
I was doing better than my father.

864
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,591
But that resolution
hit me right between the eyes.

865
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,887
Baby...

866
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,600
there are some days
I'm glad I married you.

867
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:49,064
And there are other days l'm really,
really, really glad I married you.

868
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,233
And this is one of those
really good days.

869
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,403
It's a really, really good day, huh?
Mm-hm.

870
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:59,157
By the way,
what does this resolution
look like that you're signing?

871
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:00,992
What do you mean?

872
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,244
This is not the paper
you're gonna sign.

873
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,662
This is computer paper.

874
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:09,292
A resolution is something
that a father frames
and posts on the wall.

875
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,837
We didn't talk about all that.
And how will you be signing it?

876
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:17,342
Not in jeans and a T-shirt.
Something like this needs ceremony.

877
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,469
A ceremony?
Yes, Nathan.

878
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,554
I see a group of well-dressed men

879
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:24,724
and their wives and children
making this all official.

880
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:30,480
Baby, if you're gonna do this,
then do it right.

881
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,071
So this resolution deal
has gotten pretty big, huh?

882
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:41,908
We decided if we're gonna do it,
we're gonna do it right.

883
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,494
Yeah, suits and everything.

884
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,460
Nathan, can I ask you something?
Yeah, what's up?

885
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,465
Do you really feel like it messed up
your childhood not having a dad?

886
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,509
More than you know.

887
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,554
I struggled with who I was,

888
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,349
trying to prove myself.

889
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:09,185
I almost got in a gang.

890
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,313
If fathers did
what they're supposed to,

891
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:16,151
half of the junk that we face
on the streets wouldn't exist.

892
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,736
Why are you worried about it?

893
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,322
You nervous about
being a father one day?

894
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:25,910
I already am one.

895
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,372
You got a kid?

896
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,001
A little girl.

897
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,504
She's 4 now.

898
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,720
I was playing ball in college,
hooked up with a cheerleader.

899
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:49,851
I told her to take care of it,
but she didn't do it.

900
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,815
So l got mad
and left her to deal with it herself.

901
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:02,530
You know she lives 30 minutes away,
and l can't bring myself to go see her?

902
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,073
She married?

903
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,660
No.

904
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:13,541
I just never really loved her,
you know?

905
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:19,047
Hearing you talk about how fathers
walking out messed up the kids,

906
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:21,507
and then seeing this stuff...

907
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:26,429
I don't wanna be
one of those guys.

908
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:31,684
David, part of being a man
is about taking responsibility.

909
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,853
Any fool can have a child.

910
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,440
I'm just tired of feeling guilty.

911
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,194
Let me break it to you this way.
You are guilty.

912
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:46,658
Listen, one day,
you, me and every one of us

913
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,911
are gonna have to stand
before God,

914
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,622
and he's gonna do
what good judges do.

915
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,627
Well, then l hope my good
outweighs my bad, Nathan.

916
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,339
That's not the way it works.
You know that.

917
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,716
Let me put it this way.

918
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,469
Who's the person
you're closest to?

919
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,139
Probably my mom.
Okay.

920
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:14,894
Suppose she was brutally attacked
and murdered in a parking lot.

921
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,855
The guy was caught
and put on trial.

922
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,733
But he says, "Hey, judge,
I committed this crime,

923
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:23,569
but I've done a lot
of good in my life."

924
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:29,242
If the judge let him go free,
would you say he was
a good or a bad judge?

925
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,412
A bad one.
That's right.

926
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,789
The Bible says
that God is a good judge

927
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,084
and will punish the guilty
not for what they did right,

928
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,211
but for what they did wrong.

929
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:43,172
Because he loved us,
he sent his son, Jesus Christ,

930
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:47,260
to take the punishment
that we deserve
and put it on himself.

931
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,555
And that's why he died
on the cross.

932
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,310
But it only applies
if you accept it.

933
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:01,357
That's why I asked
for his forgiveness.

934
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,068
I asked him to save me.

935
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,280
And l'm a new man
because of Christ.

936
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,326
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

937
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,621
Then what's
holding you back?

938
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,377
Nothing.

939
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:28,092
# l ran away from your love #

940
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,887
# But you waited for me #

941
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,766
# Yes, you waited for me #

942
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:40,188
#And then l heard your song #

943
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:46,819
# Singing over me #

944
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:52,408
# Now that I hear you, Lord #

945
01:12:52,576 --> 01:13:00,083
# l wanna know you more #

946
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,126
# Sing your song to me #

947
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:05,505
# Oh, there's no greater thing #

948
01:13:05,672 --> 01:13:10,593
# Than to listen to the sound
Of your voice #

949
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:14,555
# The sound of your voice ##

950
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:02,061
# l'd like to sail the lands afar #

951
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:07,692
# Out on a boat that's built for two #

952
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:12,947
# Beneath the canopy of stars #

953
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:17,869
# That would be just like
A dream come true #

954
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,791
# Just to be with you #

955
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:30,256
# And oh, oh, oh, oh
When we're together #

956
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:33,593
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

957
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,471
When you're ready to dance,
this is what you do.

958
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:41,184
First, you put your right hand
around my waist like this.

959
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:45,229
Then you hold your other hand out
like this.

960
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:49,442
Then we sway back and forth
to the music.

961
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,329
# l'd like a castle on a hill #

962
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:06,792
# Where you and I
Could spend the day #

963
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:12,965
# And I'd love to go
Where time stands still #

964
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:17,637
# And all that doesn't matter
Fades away #

965
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:23,476
# You are here with me #

966
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:30,233
# And oh, oh, oh, oh
When we're together ##

967
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:47,333
Lord, thank you
for the nine years I had Emily.

968
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:51,254
I'm grateful.

969
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,430
I don't know if l can ask this...

970
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,395
but would you tell her
I did my side of the dance?

971
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,960
Javi.

972
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:34,422
I love it. lt's perfect.

973
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:36,591
I don't know.
Should I have done this?

974
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,218
Yes. Put it on for me.

975
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,847
Right now?
Right now. I wanna see you in it.

976
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,770
No, no, no. Here, let me do it.

977
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,946
Yes, this is Daddy's suit
he'll wear to his ceremony
next week.

978
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,781
We'll all be wearing
our very best.

979
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,221
I feel like a rich man.

980
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:28,351
You are a rich man.

981
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:33,272
You have a strong faith,
children that love you.

982
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:37,068
Yeah, and a wife that adores you.

983
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,279
Stop it, Carmen.

984
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:43,282
Don't make me cry
in front of the children.

985
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,835
Starting today,
I'm implementing
a new code of ethics

986
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,463
for the entire sheriff's office.

987
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,257
No matter how you feel
about another employee,

988
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:03,803
I want you to keep
your personal feelings to yourself.

989
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,389
I don't wanna hear
how much you love me

990
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:09,183
or any other staff member.

991
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:14,480
It's inappropriate, it's awkward,
and it's unacceptable.

992
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,025
And Corporal Mitchell...

993
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:21,696
I gotcha.

994
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,285
I love you, Adam.

995
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:35,543
I can't tell you what an honor
this is for me today.

996
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,963
To hear the commitment
that you men are making

997
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:43,926
for your faith and your families
was almost overwhelming.

998
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:47,930
Nathan, I'd like for you
to come and stand before me

999
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,600
and your wife and children
to stand beside me.

1000
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:03,195
My son in the faith, I took joy
in mentoring you as a young man,

1001
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:08,200
and today I take joy
in blessing you as a godly father.

1002
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:13,372
Are you ready
to make this commitment
before God and your family?

1003
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,499
Yes, l am.

1004
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,711
Then I'd like for you
to repeat after me.

1005
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:26,010
I, Nathan Hayes,
do solemnly resolve before God...

1006
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:31,432
To take full responsibility for myself,
my wife and my children.

1007
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:37,062
That I will take full responsibility
for myself, my wife and my children.

1008
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:44,653
I will love them,
protect them and serve them...

1009
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:54,079
And teach them the statutes of God
as the spiritual leader of my home.

1010
01:19:54,247 --> 01:20:01,295
I will be faithful to my wife,
to love and honor her...

1011
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:09,637
And be willing to lay down my life
for her, as Christ did for me.

1012
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,890
I will teach my son
to love God

1013
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:16,977
with all of his heart, all of his mind,
and all of his strength.

1014
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,896
I will teach my son to love God

1015
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:22,191
with all of his heart, all of his mind,
and all of his strength.

1016
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:26,904
And l will train him to honor
authority and live responsibly.

1017
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:30,825
I will train him to honor authority
and to live responsibly.

1018
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:34,829
I will confront evil,
pursue justice, and love mercy.

1019
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:38,624
I will treat others with kindness,
respect and compassion.

1020
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,503
I will work diligently to provide
for the needs of my family.

1021
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:46,507
I will forgive those
who have wronged me

1022
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,385
and reconcile with those
who I have wronged.

1023
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:52,596
I will walk in integrity
as a man answerable to God.

1024
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:57,184
I will seek to honor God,
obey his word and do his will.

1025
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:01,939
As for me and my house,
we will serve the Lord.

1026
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:08,153
Now that each
of you has committed
to live by this resolution,

1027
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,824
I bless you
in the name of the Lord.

1028
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:15,160
But I also have a warning
for each of you.

1029
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:19,164
Now that you know
what you are to do

1030
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:24,044
and have committed to do it
before God and these witnesses,

1031
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:27,339
you are doubly accountable.

1032
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,383
Let me also assure you

1033
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:34,346
that you may have confidence in
this resolution and your resolve now

1034
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:36,348
because as you stand here

1035
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:41,061
there's no challenge,
no controversy and no conflict.

1036
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,773
But I can assure you
that challenges will arise,

1037
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,610
conflicts will arise,

1038
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:50,362
and controversy will arise.

1039
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:54,992
It is at that moment that in order
to live out this resolution,

1040
01:21:55,201 --> 01:22:00,623
you will need courage,
courage, courage.

1041
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:43,082
Dear Amanda, I know it's a shock
for you to hear from me,

1042
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:46,210
but I need to tell you
what's happened in my life.

1043
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:50,839
In the last two years,
I've become a deputy
for the Albany Sheriff's Office.

1044
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,174
This job is tough,

1045
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:55,386
but I work with some
of the best guys in the world.

1046
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,806
Being a cop has forced me
to see the worst in people

1047
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:03,310
and see how one person's selfish
decisions can hurt so many others.

1048
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:06,271
Recently,
I had a life-changing experience

1049
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:09,483
and began a relationship with God
through Jesus Christ.

1050
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,777
I've still got a lot to work on,

1051
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,446
but he's helping me
make sense out of my life

1052
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:17,825
and take more responsibility
for who l am as a man.

1053
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:23,414
For years, l've been afraid to admit
that I have a daughter

1054
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,874
and doing nothing
to take care of her.

1055
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:29,003
I see now that every child
is a gift from God.

1056
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,671
I know how wrong l've been

1057
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:34,675
and have asked God to forgive me
for what l've done to you and Olivia.

1058
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,929
I'm writing this letter to tell you
that I've decided to stop running.

1059
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,557
If you're willing,

1060
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:45,853
I'd like to meet with you and begin
the process of rebuilding your trust.

1061
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:51,316
In time and with your permission,
I hope to meet Olivia personally

1062
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,778
and let her know that she has
a father who cares about her.

1063
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:57,489
I have no other expectations.

1064
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:01,493
I'm only asking for a chance
to be a part of Olivia's life.

1065
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,871
I'll wait for your response.

1066
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,166
Until then, I've begun to pray
for you and Olivia

1067
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:11,378
and have enclosed a symbol of
my commitment to help with her care.

1068
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:15,591
Sincerely, David Thomson.

1069
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,973
Okay, God.

1070
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:28,062
Whatever you wanna do, I'm ready.

1071
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:46,038
"My name is Nathan Hayes,
and l am your son.

1072
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:52,211
I've wasted too much time
being angry with you

1073
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,255
and asking why
you were never there for me.

1074
01:24:56,257 --> 01:25:02,513
I've always felt like l needed
to prove myself to you

1075
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:06,100
and that I was worth being loved.

1076
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:09,686
But I realize
that I have a heavenly father

1077
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:13,565
who loves me even when
my earthly father did not.

1078
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:17,027
But he is more than enough.

1079
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:20,781
Because of him,
I've forgiven you.

1080
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:24,201
He is your judge, not me.

1081
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:27,704
And l live with the hope
that you gave him your life

1082
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:30,374
before you died

1083
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:35,420
so that one day,
I'll finally meet you

1084
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,631
face-to-face."

1085
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:17,880
Okay, hold on.
I wanna rest
for a minute.

1086
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:31,727
I wanna talk to you for a second.
Okay.

1087
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:35,063
I know...

1088
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:40,152
every day I live,
I realize I need the Lord more.

1089
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:45,324
I don't feel like l started well.

1090
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:51,830
I wanna finish well.

1091
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,585
What l want for you

1092
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:59,379
is that you seek the Lord,

1093
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:02,966
that you trust him.

1094
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:06,053
Even if it means
you're standing alone.

1095
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:10,015
You got me?

1096
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,393
Yes, sir.

1097
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,979
Now, before l beat you
to the corner--

1098
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:19,191
Heh, you're not gonna beat me
to the corner.

1099
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,277
Just let me get a breath.

1100
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:27,407
Okay.

1101
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,787
What is that?
What?

1102
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:34,998
I don't-- Hey, you can't do that!

1103
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:09,449
Mr. Martinez, have a seat.
Thank you, sir.

1104
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,869
You've been very productive
your first month here.

1105
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:16,581
You do good work.
I'm very grateful to be here.

1106
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,583
The reason l called you in here

1107
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:23,171
is that I'm looking
for a manager to oversee
Inventory and Shipping.

1108
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:25,716
Carries more responsibility,
but it pays more.

1109
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:28,218
Sound like something
you might be interested in?

1110
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:31,471
Yes, l would.
But before I make my final decision,

1111
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:35,225
I'd like for you to work a shift
in that department next week.

1112
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:38,770
You'll see a list of 1 7 crates
coming in on this sheet.

1113
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:42,482
Now, one of those crates
will be going to a separate
warehouse.

1114
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:45,485
Mr. Martinez,
when you report the inventory,

1115
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:49,197
I'd like for you to report
that we received 1 6 crates.

1116
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:56,580
Seventeen are coming in,
but you want me to write down 1 6?

1117
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:59,166
Yes, that's right.

1118
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,835
I have another purpose
for the extra crate.

1119
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:07,841
You are on my team, right?

1120
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:12,179
Because I really can't use
people who aren't on my team.

1121
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,683
Tell you what.

1122
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,978
Think about it tonight.
Give me your answer
in the morning.

1123
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:21,772
Make it 1 0:00.

1124
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:25,609
But I'll need to know
if you really want this job.

1125
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,527
Good evening, sir.

1126
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:43,335
Hey, sarge.
Hey.

1127
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:47,130
Sanders said the drugs
we found on Highland
have been logged in?

1128
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,590
Yeah, 4:30.

1129
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,177
He told me 24 bags were turned in.
I thought I remembered 30.

1130
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,515
Well, it says here 24 went to the lab.
You sure you guys counted right?

1131
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:00,352
Well, maybe not.

1132
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:04,648
You guys have been bringing in
pretty heavy hitters here lately.

1133
01:30:04,857 --> 01:30:07,734
You had that bust over
on Gore Street last week.

1134
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:11,363
Before that,
you brought in that box
with six bags of rocks in it.

1135
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,783
Six bags?
That's what l got here.

1136
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:19,413
You keep this up, you're gonna put
another drug dealer out of business.

1137
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,084
Thanks, sarge.
You bet.

1138
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,049
- You coming?
- Just give me a second.

1139
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:33,051
- All right.
- I'm gonna go get some.

1140
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:34,928
Oh, come on, man.

1141
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:38,765
- Hey, sarge, you got a second?
- Yeah.

1142
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,100
Um...

1143
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:41,977
Think l may have an issue.

1144
01:30:42,895 --> 01:30:44,479
What's that?

1145
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:49,568
I think someone's
ripping off evidence.

1146
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,195
Who?

1147
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,241
One of your guys?

1148
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:04,416
Are you sure
you wanna go down this road?

1149
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:09,171
No, I'm not.

1150
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:16,261
We need this job.
For the first time in a year,
we're able to pay the bills.

1151
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:18,221
I know, but he made it very clear.

1152
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,807
If l was not a team player,
he did not want me.

1153
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:23,810
Maybe it's not wrong,
it just looks that way.

1154
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:25,562
He's the owner of the factory.

1155
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,440
He asked me to write down
false information, Carmen.

1156
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,358
He asked me to lie.

1157
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,530
When do you have to
give him an answer?

1158
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:37,532
Ten o'clock.

1159
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:43,205
Javi, if he lets you go,
promise me that you will call me.

1160
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:45,749
If you don't,
then I know everything is okay.

1161
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,922
Javi, l don't want us to go back.

1162
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:05,894
I hope you're wrong about this.

1163
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,106
I hope I'm wrong about this.

1164
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,569
But what if you're not?

1165
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,578
I still have to do
the right thing.

1166
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:58,947
Good morning, sir.

1167
01:32:59,156 --> 01:33:02,284
Good morning, Mr. Martinez.
How are you this morning?

1168
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:04,619
Fine, thank you. How are you?

1169
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,789
I don't know yet.
Please, have a seat.

1170
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,545
I trust you've had time to think
about our conversation yesterday.

1171
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,005
Yes, sir, I did.

1172
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:19,050
And what did you decide?
Are you on my team?

1173
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:25,140
Mr. Tyson, I am very grateful
to have a job here,

1174
01:33:25,349 --> 01:33:27,392
but I cannot do
as you have asked.

1175
01:33:29,228 --> 01:33:30,437
And why is that?

1176
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:35,066
Because it is wrong, sir.

1177
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:39,863
And it would be dishonoring
to my God and my family
to lie on that report.

1178
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:47,287
Do you understand what
this may do to your job here?

1179
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,374
Yes, sir, I do.

1180
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:01,259
Javier, may I shake your hand?

1181
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,722
Young man, you just gave me
the right answer.

1182
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:09,225
I've been looking for someone
to manage Inventory and Shipping.

1183
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:13,772
You were the last person on my list.
But I need somebody l can trust.

1184
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:16,816
Will you take the job?
We'll adjust your pay.

1185
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:22,197
I would be honored to, sir.
Good. Then the job is yours.

1186
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:24,574
Walter will go over
the specifics with you.

1187
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,327
I'll make the announcement
to the staff on Monday.

1188
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:28,745
Congratulations, Javier.

1189
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,082
Oh, and, Javier.

1190
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:36,002
Thanks for your integrity.

1191
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,504
It's rare.

1192
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,467
Well done, Javier.

1193
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:45,762
After six times,
I was getting discouraged.

1194
01:35:07,326 --> 01:35:10,078
No, no. Please, God, no.

1195
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:19,045
Carmen, be strong for him.

1196
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:22,924
Hello?
Carmen.

1197
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:27,679
Javi, it's okay, baby.
It'll be okay, we'll make it.

1198
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:30,849
We'll get through this.
No, Carmen, listen to me.

1199
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:33,476
The Lord knew
we were gonna go through this.

1200
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,186
I was not let go.

1201
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:39,107
I know, baby. lt's okay.
Carmen, you're not listening to me.

1202
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:42,318
They did not fire me.
They promoted me.

1203
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:48,867
What?
It was a test, Carmen.

1204
01:35:49,034 --> 01:35:52,078
They made me a manager.
And they're gonna raise my pay.

1205
01:35:53,038 --> 01:35:56,750
A test?
I was promoted, Carmen.

1206
01:35:56,959 --> 01:35:59,085
Everything is gonna be okay.

1207
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,049
What's wrong, Mommy?

1208
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:08,887
- Are you okay, Mommy?
- I'm okay. We're all okay.

1209
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:13,016
I love you, Carmen.
And tell the children
I love them too.

1210
01:36:13,225 --> 01:36:15,268
And that God answered
our prayers.

1211
01:36:16,228 --> 01:36:19,105
I'll tell them, Javi. l love you too.

1212
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,066
I'll talk to you soon.

1213
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:02,607
Hey, sarge, you called me?
Yeah.

1214
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:05,944
They're still doing motions,
and l gotta get back to testify.

1215
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:09,405
Would you mind running these down
to Evidence for me? Appreciate it.

1216
01:37:09,573 --> 01:37:11,115
Okay.

1217
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:30,760
Sarge?

1218
01:37:52,449 --> 01:37:53,950
What are you doing?

1219
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,704
Adam.

1220
01:37:58,914 --> 01:38:00,832
So it's you.

1221
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,209
This is what
you've been doing?

1222
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:06,504
What? Rechecking the count
before I turn it in?

1223
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:11,092
No, no, no, don't lie to me.
You got bags in your pocket
right now.

1224
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:26,149
You're not gonna
turn me in.

1225
01:38:26,358 --> 01:38:29,986
You'd just make a big,
ugly mess and embarrass
the entire department.

1226
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:32,322
Besides, it'd be
your word against mine.

1227
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:35,325
No, it wouldn't.

1228
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:42,916
Oh, l see. You've thought
this whole thing out.

1229
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:46,044
Two cops camp out
to bust their friend.

1230
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:48,254
What have we been doing
the last month?

1231
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:51,424
What did you commit to?
Don't you throw that in my face!

1232
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,761
I work hard to provide,
and 36,000 a year doesn't cut it.

1233
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:57,847
You'd do the same thing.
I wouldn't do the same thing.

1234
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,515
Does your word mean nothing?

1235
01:38:59,683 --> 01:39:03,394
You signed the same thing we did.
You're throwing it down the toilet

1236
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:06,022
for an extra thousand a month?
Adam.

1237
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:10,068
You've been lying to all of us, Shane.
Your friends, your son, to God.

1238
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:11,778
Adam.

1239
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:18,451
I'm a fellow officer and a friend.
You do not wanna do this.

1240
01:39:19,578 --> 01:39:22,872
You're right. I don't.

1241
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,249
- Turn around.
- Put your hands on the wall.

1242
01:39:25,417 --> 01:39:27,543
- What?
- You're under arrest.

1243
01:39:28,545 --> 01:39:30,755
This is a mistake.

1244
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:33,466
This is a mistake.
You're gonna burn us all.

1245
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,009
Is that what you want?

1246
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:39,931
Is that really what you want?
Let's go, let's go.

1247
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:41,683
Is this what you want?!

1248
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:52,318
We all agreed, Adam.
We are doubly accountable.

1249
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:48,124
I'm gonna have the fillet,
medium well, with vegetables.

1250
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,877
Very good, sir.
I'll be back with your appetizer.

1251
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,128
Thank you.

1252
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:55,673
Wow. Daddy, this place is nice.

1253
01:40:56,216 --> 01:40:59,052
Isn't it expensive?
Well, tonight's a special night.

1254
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:00,261
It's worth it to me.

1255
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:03,681
Well, what's so special
about tonight?

1256
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:08,811
I brought you because
I wanna tell you how grateful
I am God gave you to me.

1257
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:11,647
I see my daughter becoming
a beautiful young woman.

1258
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:15,777
And l can understand how any
young man would be drawn to you.

1259
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:20,364
But I would also like for you
to know that as your father,

1260
01:41:20,532 --> 01:41:22,950
I want the very, very best for you.

1261
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:27,038
One day l'll give you away
to another man,

1262
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:31,375
and l want that man
to love God more than anything.

1263
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:35,213
Because if he does,
then he'll love you.

1264
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:38,007
And l know
how young men think.

1265
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:42,428
They wanna win your heart,
but they don't know
how to treasure it.

1266
01:41:42,638 --> 01:41:45,515
So l'd like to make
an agreement with you.

1267
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:47,683
Okay.

1268
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:53,689
Jade, if you'll trust me
with your heart and allow me
to approve any young man

1269
01:41:53,899 --> 01:41:57,401
that desires to have more
than a friendship with you,

1270
01:41:57,569 --> 01:42:01,531
I promise to take care of you
and give you my full blessing

1271
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:04,075
when God shows us
the right one.

1272
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:09,288
Okay.

1273
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:10,790
I will.

1274
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:15,711
Thank you.

1275
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,966
I have something to help us
to remember this night.

1276
01:42:26,181 --> 01:42:27,807
Daddy.

1277
01:42:29,101 --> 01:42:31,686
Jade, will you give me
your left hand, please?

1278
01:42:33,188 --> 01:42:36,983
Daddy, is this real?
Yes, it is.

1279
01:42:37,192 --> 01:42:40,987
This is meant to be worn until
it's replaced by your wedding ring.

1280
01:42:42,197 --> 01:42:44,407
Jade, l love you, sweetie.

1281
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:47,285
And from this night on,

1282
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:50,830
I wanna treat you like
the young woman that you are.

1283
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:57,086
Daddy, thank you so much.

1284
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,715
I love you too. l love you.

1285
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,441
Hey, Shane.

1286
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:06,197
Can't tell you what it's like
to be on this side of the glass.

1287
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:10,826
Shane, I'm sorry.

1288
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:13,162
Don't apologize.

1289
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:18,960
I knew what I was doing.

1290
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:26,842
I guess somewhere along the way,
I let go of the wheel.

1291
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:35,059
And now I couldn't get it back
even if l wanted to.

1292
01:44:37,145 --> 01:44:40,064
Shane, you've gotta get right
with God first.

1293
01:44:40,232 --> 01:44:42,608
And then you've gotta get right
with your son.

1294
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:51,534
I've lost him, Adam.
No, you haven't lost him.

1295
01:44:51,743 --> 01:44:54,787
He's hurting,
but you haven't lost him.

1296
01:45:01,503 --> 01:45:04,297
You have to help me with Tyler.

1297
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:07,591
He, uh...

1298
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:13,639
He needs someone
to look out for him.

1299
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:23,816
I'll look after him.
You have my word.

1300
01:45:26,069 --> 01:45:28,112
I don't want him to be like me.

1301
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:34,327
Adam...

1302
01:45:35,078 --> 01:45:36,245
I'm sorry.

1303
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:42,043
Forgive me.

1304
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:44,670
Please.

1305
01:45:48,133 --> 01:45:49,759
I forgive you.

1306
01:45:56,808 --> 01:46:00,019
Listen, l'll come see you again,
all right?

1307
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:03,105
Okay.

1308
01:46:05,692 --> 01:46:07,401
Hey.

1309
01:46:09,112 --> 01:46:11,238
Don't ever let go of the wheel.

1310
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:15,743
Never.

1311
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:42,770
I picked up the mother lode.
Gotta get to the house, meet Tyrone.

1312
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:45,147
How much?
Man, 40 stacks, dawg.

1313
01:46:45,315 --> 01:46:48,776
Forty stacks?
T.J., that's crazy, man.

1314
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:50,945
We ain't playing
Little League no more.

1315
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:53,948
We're going prime time. Tell him.
That's right, dawg.

1316
01:46:54,116 --> 01:46:56,450
- I got two keys in the trunk now.
- Two kilos?

1317
01:46:56,618 --> 01:46:59,078
That's right. We told you,
we ain't playing.

1318
01:46:59,287 --> 01:47:01,038
All we gotta do is
go cook it up.

1319
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:07,336
- Heh. It's Adam.
- Yeah?

1320
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:10,714
- We were just talking about you.
- Yeah, where are you guys?

1321
01:47:10,924 --> 01:47:13,801
Coming up on Denson.
I'm three miles behind you.

1322
01:47:13,969 --> 01:47:16,178
We gotta talk
about this Father's Day deal.

1323
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:19,348
Can you come over this week?
Already talked about that.

1324
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:22,643
Since you came up
with the resolution,
you're the spokesman.

1325
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:23,978
- It's only fair.
- Heh, heh, heh.

1326
01:47:24,187 --> 01:47:26,439
No, we didn't agree to that.
We gotta vote.

1327
01:47:26,648 --> 01:47:28,023
No, we already voted.

1328
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:31,986
David and I chose you, and look,
you know Javi's gonna go with us.

1329
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:33,446
Ha, ha, ha.

1330
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:37,741
If l do this, you owe me dinner.
I gotta go. We'll talk about this later.

1331
01:47:37,909 --> 01:47:40,995
I got a green Cadillac
with a blown taillight.

1332
01:47:41,204 --> 01:47:43,205
- Light them up for me.
- Yeah, I got you.

1333
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:44,915
I'll talk to you later.

1334
01:47:48,336 --> 01:47:51,422
Hold up, man.
What is this cop doing?
I ain't even speeding.

1335
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:52,756
We can't do this.

1336
01:47:52,924 --> 01:47:56,427
Yo, dawg, they bust us this time,
that's an automatic 1 0 years.

1337
01:47:56,636 --> 01:47:59,388
Ten years?
Yo, what you gonna do, man?

1338
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:02,766
I just gotta get off this road.

1339
01:48:02,934 --> 01:48:05,227
I'll take him out
before I go back to jail.

1340
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:08,898
Take him out? You gonna shoot him?
Look, you wanna go to prison?

1341
01:48:10,358 --> 01:48:13,861
?Huh? Because
if he searches this car,
that's where you're going.

1342
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:19,325
What is he doing?

1343
01:48:20,118 --> 01:48:23,412
He better pull over before l get him
for more than a taillight.

1344
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,998
Go ahead and call it in.
Yeah.

1345
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:36,342
We can't do this, man.
We can't shoot no cop.

1346
01:48:36,551 --> 01:48:39,637
We ain't got no choice,
Derrick. Be cool.

1347
01:48:48,104 --> 01:48:49,438
You want me to take this?

1348
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:51,273
No, I got it.
All right.

1349
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:56,445
There's two of them, T.J.
We can't shoot both.

1350
01:48:56,613 --> 01:49:00,032
Shut up, man.
You'll do what I tell you to do.

1351
01:49:04,287 --> 01:49:07,164
Oh, man, I know this cop.

1352
01:49:08,833 --> 01:49:11,335
He about to get
what he got coming to him.

1353
01:49:15,423 --> 01:49:17,132
T.J., that's Jade's daddy.

1354
01:49:22,597 --> 01:49:26,517
Sir, l need you
to turn off the vehicle,
put your hands on the wheel.

1355
01:49:34,025 --> 01:49:37,152
The reason l pulled you over is that--
No!

1356
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:51,292
Go, go, go!

1357
01:49:55,297 --> 01:49:56,505
Ah! Unh!

1358
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:04,096
- Back up, back up, back up!
- I got the side.

1359
01:50:05,974 --> 01:50:07,725
Stay down, sir. Stay down.

1360
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:11,520
- We can't stay here, we gotta move.
- Get out, get out, get out!

1361
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:16,859
This is 6-93-D. Shots fired,
Denson Road. We need backup.

1362
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:20,154
Repeat, we need backup.
Six-93-C en route.

1363
01:50:22,532 --> 01:50:24,199
D, what you think you're doing?

1364
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:28,495
You trying to save that little punk?
You ain't nothing. l should kill you.

1365
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:30,998
Man, you crazy?
I should kill you right now.

1366
01:50:33,335 --> 01:50:34,752
I don't wanna be here, man.

1367
01:50:34,919 --> 01:50:36,629
- I don't wanna be here.
- Get off.

1368
01:50:37,922 --> 01:50:40,090
Argh! Ahh!

1369
01:50:41,593 --> 01:50:45,220
Stay back, stay back!
Just drive back.

1370
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:48,599
- I'm moving to the front.
- All right, l got you, l got you.

1371
01:50:55,565 --> 01:50:57,483
I'm out, Nathan, l'm out.

1372
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:02,988
Adam's coming, Nathan.

1373
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,042
I got three guys.

1374
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:18,504
One has a shotgun, 9 mm.
I'm almost out of ammo.

1375
01:51:18,713 --> 01:51:22,591
Twon, hey, come here, man.
Shoot this for me. I can't hold it still.

1376
01:51:22,801 --> 01:51:25,552
Twon, come get it!
Give it to me, give it to me.

1377
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,389
- Get out of the way.
- Get out of the way.

1378
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:37,189
I'm out of ammo.

1379
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:38,857
Switch.

1380
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:42,319
Stay down.

1381
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:50,619
Twon, man, look. Twon!
What?

1382
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:53,706
The girl. We need leverage.
We gotta get out of here.

1383
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:56,041
I'm out, I'm out, l'm out.

1384
01:51:57,001 --> 01:51:58,836
I got them, I got them,
I got them.

1385
01:52:00,171 --> 01:52:02,423
They're going after that girl.
Stay with me.

1386
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:05,217
- Stay to the right. Stay with me.
- I got you.

1387
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:07,261
Front of the car, front of the car.
Aah!

1388
01:52:07,429 --> 01:52:08,929
- Go, go.
- Show me your hands.

1389
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:11,724
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands.

1390
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:16,228
- You got him. Nathan, stay with me.
- Get up. Give me your arms.

1391
01:52:18,022 --> 01:52:19,606
Come here.

1392
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:28,157
- Daddy, Daddy! Aah!
- Come here, come here.

1393
01:52:31,035 --> 01:52:32,911
Come here.

1394
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:35,622
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

1395
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:03,650
Get down! Stay down!

1396
01:53:03,818 --> 01:53:05,360
- Stay down!
- Get off me.

1397
01:53:09,073 --> 01:53:10,115
Get off.

1398
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:21,960
- Adam, are you okay?
- Get the girl, help the girl.

1399
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:25,005
- She's all right. She's with her dad.
- She's all right.

1400
01:54:10,218 --> 01:54:13,136
Hey, you okay?

1401
01:54:13,346 --> 01:54:15,430
That dude was strong.

1402
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:19,351
Hey, you looking like I'm feeling.
I'm feeling like I'm looking.

1403
01:54:20,812 --> 01:54:22,020
Okay, well, come on.

1404
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:27,943
Man, thank God for backup.
Yep.

1405
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:32,781
You just be glad
you fought the small guy.

1406
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:35,576
The small one?
Hey, Victoria.

1407
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:40,330
No, I'm okay.

1408
01:54:48,172 --> 01:54:50,966
Derrick, what are you doing?

1409
01:54:51,134 --> 01:54:52,843
Why are you with these guys?

1410
01:54:56,139 --> 01:54:58,724
I ain't got nobody, man.

1411
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:01,351
I just ain't got nobody.

1412
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:22,456
You did good today,
David.

1413
01:55:22,999 --> 01:55:25,208
Yeah, you mean
for a rookie, right?

1414
01:55:27,086 --> 01:55:28,837
You're not a rookie.

1415
01:55:47,065 --> 01:55:48,732
For the last six weeks

1416
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:53,070
I've preached on God's design
for fathers

1417
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:57,366
to be teachers, to be protectors,
to be providers.

1418
01:55:57,575 --> 01:56:00,702
I read to you this resolution
that was written and signed

1419
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:03,622
by the four men
standing behind me.

1420
01:56:03,831 --> 01:56:06,208
But instead of just talking
about these men,

1421
01:56:06,376 --> 01:56:10,045
I wanna ask Adam Mitchell
to come and speak to us.

1422
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:36,822
As a law-enforcement officer,

1423
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:40,867
I've seen firsthand the deep hurt
and devastation

1424
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:44,538
that fatherlessness brings
in a child's life.

1425
01:56:44,747 --> 01:56:47,207
Our prisons are full
of men and women

1426
01:56:47,375 --> 01:56:50,752
who lived recklessly after
being abandoned by their fathers,

1427
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:54,256
wounded by the men who
should have loved them the most.

1428
01:56:54,799 --> 01:57:00,095
Many now follow the same
pattern of irresponsibility
that their fathers did.

1429
01:57:00,763 --> 01:57:04,933
While so many mothers
have sacrificed to help
their children survive,

1430
01:57:05,143 --> 01:57:08,311
they were never intended
to carry the weight alone.

1431
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:10,814
We thank God for them.

1432
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:17,779
But research is proving that a child
also desperately needs a daddy.

1433
01:57:17,989 --> 01:57:20,032
There's no way around this fact.

1434
01:57:22,326 --> 01:57:24,703
As you know, earlier this year,

1435
01:57:24,912 --> 01:57:30,083
my family endured the tragic loss
of our 9-year-old daughter, Emily.

1436
01:57:30,251 --> 01:57:32,502
Her death forced me to realize that

1437
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:37,382
not only had I not taken advantage
of the priceless time I had with her,

1438
01:57:37,592 --> 01:57:41,470
but that I did not truly understand
how crucial my role was

1439
01:57:41,637 --> 01:57:44,931
as a father to her
and our son, Dylan.

1440
01:57:45,725 --> 01:57:49,895
Since her passing, I've asked God
to show me, through his word

1441
01:57:50,104 --> 01:57:53,398
how to be the father
that I need to be.

1442
01:57:54,692 --> 01:57:58,111
I now believe
that God desires for every father

1443
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:02,282
to courageously step up
and do whatever it takes

1444
01:58:02,450 --> 01:58:04,910
to be involved
in the lives of his children.

1445
01:58:06,496 --> 01:58:09,581
But more than just being there
or providing for them,

1446
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:12,292
he's to walk with them
through their lives

1447
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:15,587
and be a visual representation
of the character of God,

1448
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:17,464
their father in heaven.

1449
01:58:17,632 --> 01:58:22,302
A father should love his children
and seek to win their hearts.

1450
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:25,305
He should protect them,
discipline them

1451
01:58:25,473 --> 01:58:28,100
and teach them about God.

1452
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:32,104
He should model how to walk with
integrity and treat others with respect

1453
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:36,024
and should call out his children to
become responsible men and women

1454
01:58:36,192 --> 01:58:39,402
who live their lives
for what matters in eternity.

1455
01:58:40,154 --> 01:58:42,906
Some men will hear this
and mock it

1456
01:58:43,074 --> 01:58:44,950
or ignore it.

1457
01:58:45,159 --> 01:58:49,788
But I tell you that as a father,
you are accountable to God

1458
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:53,625
for the position of influence
he has given you.

1459
01:58:54,502 --> 01:58:56,711
You can't fall asleep at the wheel

1460
01:58:56,921 --> 01:58:59,798
only to wake up one day
and realize that your job

1461
01:59:00,007 --> 01:59:02,801
or your hobbies
have no eternal value

1462
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:05,804
but the souls of your children do.

1463
01:59:06,013 --> 01:59:08,807
Some men will hear this
and agree with it

1464
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:11,685
but have no resolve to live it out.

1465
01:59:12,895 --> 01:59:15,564
lnstead,
they will live for themselves

1466
01:59:15,773 --> 01:59:21,111
and waste the opportunity
to leave a godly legacy
for the next generation.

1467
01:59:21,904 --> 01:59:23,822
But there are some men

1468
01:59:24,448 --> 01:59:28,326
who, regardless of the mistakes
we've made in the past,

1469
01:59:28,536 --> 01:59:32,164
regardless of what our fathers
did not do for us,

1470
01:59:32,331 --> 01:59:37,377
will give the strength of our arms
and the rest of our days to loving God
with all that we are

1471
01:59:37,879 --> 01:59:40,755
and to teach our children
to do the same,

1472
01:59:40,965 --> 01:59:42,632
and, whenever possible,

1473
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:46,178
to love and mentor others
who have no father in their lives

1474
01:59:46,929 --> 01:59:51,057
but who desperately need help
and direction.

1475
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:55,478
We are inviting any man whose heart
is willing and courageous

1476
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:58,732
to join us in this resolution.

1477
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:03,028
In my home,
the decision has already been made.

1478
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:05,864
You don't have to ask
who will guide my family,

1479
02:00:06,073 --> 02:00:08,742
because by God's grace, I will.

1480
02:00:09,535 --> 02:00:13,079
You don't have to ask who will
teach my son to follow Christ,

1481
02:00:13,289 --> 02:00:15,498
because l will.

1482
02:00:16,209 --> 02:00:19,961
Who will accept
the responsibility of providing
and protecting my family?

1483
02:00:20,129 --> 02:00:21,630
I will.

1484
02:00:21,839 --> 02:00:26,218
Who will ask God to break
the chain of destructive patterns
in my family's history?

1485
02:00:26,761 --> 02:00:28,470
I will.

1486
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:31,306
Who will pray for
and bless my children

1487
02:00:31,515 --> 02:00:34,851
to boldly pursue
whatever God calls them to do?

1488
02:00:35,478 --> 02:00:38,438
I am their father. l will.

1489
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:43,944
I accept this responsibility,
and it is my privilege to embrace it.

1490
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:48,198
I want the favor of God
and his blessing on my home.

1491
02:00:48,407 --> 02:00:50,909
Any good man does.

1492
02:00:51,827 --> 02:00:54,663
So where are you, men of courage?

1493
02:00:55,289 --> 02:00:58,583
Where are you,
fathers who fear the Lord?

1494
02:00:59,085 --> 02:01:03,213
It's time to rise up and answer the call
that God has given to you

1495
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:08,218
and to say, "I will. I will. I will."
