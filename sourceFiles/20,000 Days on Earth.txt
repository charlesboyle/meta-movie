- ...cos it was so out of character...
- Mm.

173
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,853
...and him sitting down,
like you're sitting there, and saying,

174
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,645
"Now, son, there's a time
when we all become men,"

175
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,359
and giving me this talk about, um...

176
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,899
(CHUCKLES) ...about, er...
wearing women's clothing,

177
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,741
cos they were... I think they were
worried that I was a transvestite.

178
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,779
<i>Hm.</i>

179
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,495
Um...but I was just sort of in...
really in the thrall of this...

180
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,115
strange, wonderful girl.

181
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,288
What are your earliest memories of him?

182
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,831
- Of my father?
- Mm.

183
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,751
(SIGHS) Oh, I don't know.

184
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,464
You know, there must be earlier ones,

185
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:18,049
but he...he did actually
take me aside one day

186
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,891
and read me the first chapter of Lolita.

187
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,556
Why that?

188
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,896
Because he said that within that chapter,

189
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,856
great writing kind of existed in there

190
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,021
- ...on so many different levels...
- Mm.

191
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,148
...and he kind of went
through the alliteration

192
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,399
and read it out loud and said,
"See what happens here?"

193
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,072
And...you know,
and that was very powerful...

194
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,819
- Mm.
- ...thing for him to do for me,

195
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,282
because the way that I saw him
become around that kind of stuff...

196
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,206
- Mm.
- ...that was, urn...

197
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,747
...you know, different,
that he changed when he read that.

198
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,215
What did he become?

199
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,462
- You know, a...a greater thing.
- And do you ever remember...

200
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,228
Hey, this is great,
having the piano in, er...

201
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,227

202
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,726
HERVE: We can, er...tune
every piano if you need.

203
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,102
Yeah, and...and the one in the barn.

204
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,944
- Yeah.
- NICK: While Warren is doing something

205
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,022
or Tommy's doing something,
I could take this piece...

206
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,616
- HERVE: Yeah.
- ...bring it in here and just play it

207
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,576
and work it,
because a lot of the stuff's not...

208
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,037
- you know, it's very free at the moment.
- NICK LAUNAY: Yeah, yeah.

209
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,656
NICK CAVE: That's gonna be really nice.
That's See That Girl.

210
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,751
I mean, it's difficult to tell
from some of this stuff what we got.

211
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,245
- You've gotta kind of relax and...
- Mm.

212
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,668
...because we got a lot of ideas
about these things,

213
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,463
which are just fucking nothing here,
to be honest.

DARIAN: Did your father
ever come to see you play?

234
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:10,011
He came a couple of times. Both times,
I didn't know that he was there.

235
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,891
He came to the first
New Year's Eve show that I did.

236
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,861
It was a show on a street and I was
kind of rolling around drunk and singing.

237
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,230
The whole band were off their faces.

238
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,448
He asked me how it had gone
and I said, "Oh, it was good,"

239
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,112
and he went, "Yeah, I know, I was there."

240
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,736
- Hm, hm.
- But then he saw me before he died.

241
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,290
It was a paid gig at a club,
like a proper band,

242
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,626
and, um...he was at that, too,

243
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,422
and...and he, er...he saw that
and he made this comment.

244
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,132
- "You were like an angel," he said.
- Hm.

245
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,718
I can't imagine how he could have
seen me in that way, quite frankly.

246
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,178
DARIAN: Seen you as an angel?

247
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,219
(LAUGHS) Yes, an angel.
All things considered.

248
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,891
In that way in which he'd be present,
yet without declaring himself,

249
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,480
did that ever happen at home?

250
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,101
I remember one time my sister
being very upset about something,

251
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,108
and my father putting her to bed
and then leaving the room

252
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,905
and turning the light off, and my sister
was sort of sobbing in the bed, you know,

253
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,860
and then after a while...
We were very young.

254
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,239
I kind of went "Pooh", like that,
and she started to giggle, you know,

255
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,288
and then I went, "Shit",
and she started to giggle more,

256
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,786
and I went, "Fuck"
and so on, and this, er...

257
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,334
- Mm.
- ...until she was kind of laughing

258
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:23,460
and then I saw the door open
and my father kind of move out...

259
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,262
- Mm.
- ...and I'm kind of like, "Oh!" you know.

260
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,429
So, in all those examples,
he's there like a kind of silent witness?

261
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,145
Yeah. Yeah.

262
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,191
Although he wasn't... To say
that he wasn't present is not correct.

263
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,105
- But in those instances.
- Mm, mm.

264
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,357
My memory of my childhood

265
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:48,076
was really a kind of wonderful
childhood for a...for a kid.

266
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,991
Does it bring anything to mind,
a memory or...

267
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,582
Well, the Ovens River
ran through Wangaratta

268
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,168
and that's where I spent my childhood,

269
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,003
- just down by that river.
- Mm.

270
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,669
All the kind of cool stuff
that I got up to as a kid.

271
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,134
- What kind of thing?
- Kissing girls.

272
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,472
Jumping off the, er...the railway bridge
that went over this river.

273
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,014
I mean, we would put our ear to the tracks
and listen for the train

274
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,556
and hear it vibrating on the tracks.

275
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:19,399
Then we would run towards the train, along
the tracks into the middle of a bridge

276
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,142
and the train would come around like this

277
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,486
and we would run
and then we would leap off the, er...

278
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,446
- Mm.
- ...leap off the bridge into the river.

279
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,985
Mm.

280
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,655
All of that kind of daredevil
stuff of childhood,

281
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,370
which...which was very much about
what a lot of my childhood was about...

282
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,081
- Mm.
- ...um, and that I really miss,

283
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,954
that my own children don't get
to experience that sort of stuff.

284
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,423
Mm. What do you fear the most?

285
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,918
(SIGHS) Er...

286
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,847
Hm...

287
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:59,314
My...biggest fear, I guess,
is losing my memory.

288
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,023
It does worry me at times

289
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,190
that I'm not gonna be able
to continue to do what I do...

290
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,986
um...and reach a place
that I'm satisfied with.

291
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,450
In the sense?

292
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,411
Because memory is what we are,
you know, and I think

293
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:19,284
that your very soul
and your very reason...to be alive

294
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,705
is tied up in memory.

295
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,830
I mean, I think for a very long time,

296
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:28,255
I've been building up a kind of world
through narrative songwriting.

297
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,095
It is a kind of world that's created

298
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,637
about those precious, um...

299
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,057
original memories that define our lives

300
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,432
and those memories
that we spend for ever chasing after.

301
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,809
Which memories
do you think you're chasing after?

302
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,403
I think exactly what
we've been talking about.

303
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,069
Those earlier childhood memories.

304
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:55,036
Those moments when
the gears of the heart really change

305
00:19:55,152 --> 00:20:00,704
and that's...that could be being,
er...discovering some work of art.

306
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:06,756
Um...it could be some massive
traumatic experience that happens.

307
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:12,094
Um...it could be some tiny moment,
er...a fragment of a moment,

308
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,341
and in some way that's really what
the process of songwriting is for me.

309
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:22,022
It's the retelling of these stories
and the mythologizing of these stories.

310
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,268
To lose the faculty of memory
is a massive trauma

311
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,190
within that world, obviously.

NICK: If you can enter into the song
and enter into the heart of the song,

344
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,244
into the present moment,
forget everything else,

345
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,240
you can be kind of taken away...

346
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,208
and then you're sort of godlike
for a moment,

347
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,454
and sometimes it doesn't, by the way.

348
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,752
It's not that the moment you walk on, you
turn into an angel or something like that.

349
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,295
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

350
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,386
- An angel?
- OK. Let's... Yeah, yeah, whatever.

351
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:47,094
Is this a...a theme in your songs -
of responsibility and accountability?

352
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:51,472
Um...l have a kind of weird relationship
with the idea of God,

353
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:56,728
because within my songwriting world,
some kind of being like that exists.

354
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,946
- Someone watching?
- Yeah.

355
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,695
Someone taking score, let's say.

356
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,364
In the real world,
I don't believe in such a thing.

357
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:08,706
You know, when I had a...
a real interest in religion

358
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,408
was when I was taking a lot of drugs.

359
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,830
- Mm.
- You know, I was a junkie.

360
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,546
I would wake up and need to score

361
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,545
and the first thing I would do
is go to church...

362
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,713
Mm.

363
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,552
...and I would sit
through the entire service,

364
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,221
listening to the priest rant on up there
and shake his hand on the way out,

365
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,224
and then head up, er...
Portobello Road to Golborne Road.

366
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,806
The dealers were just coming out
you know, at that time,

367
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,354
and I could score
and then go back to my...

368
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,944
- Mm.
- ...flat, take the drugs and sort of go,

369
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,145
- "There," you know?
- Mm.

370
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,613
I'd do a little...little bit of good

371
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,949
and a little...
and, "What's the problem" type of thing,

372
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,948
and I really felt on some level

373
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,790
that I had a kind
of workable balance in my life.

374
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,955
- Mm. Mm.
- I mean, it was mad.

375
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:59,333
You know, I mean, when...when I met Susie,
Susie was like, you know,

376
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:03,211
"You're, er...you know, doing
something really dangerous here

377
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,181
"and...and...and life-threatening

378
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,642
"and, um...you know,
I want you to vow to me

379
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,477
"that you'll never go to church again"...

380
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,188
- (THEY CHUCKLE)
- ...kind of thing.

381
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,650
And when you're performing,
do you ever have that sense

382
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,394
of being an outsider or not?

383
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,441
No, I don't.

384
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,442
I find performing to be something
much more, um...kind of communal

385
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,740
and a much more sort of
gathering together of people and...

386
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,911
I mean you get...carried away, right?

387
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,126
- You get taken away, anyway.
- Mm.

388
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,835
Something happens on stage.

389
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,829
- Once you're on the stage?
- Yeah. Not even before

390
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,798
I get near the stage.
In fact, before I'm on the stage,

391
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,963
before, in the band room, it's horrendous,

392
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,634
because you can't really understand
how you can do the show.

393
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,385
But something happens on stage, um...

394
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:56,514
that takes you away from that
and it's those kind of concerts,

395
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,063
it's the concerts that we're trying to do
that are so important,

396
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,817
and they're so important
for, um...the audience.

397
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,359
To go beyond something?

398
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,985
Well, not every gig you're gonna go to
is gonna make you feel that way,

399
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,737
but when...when they do...

400
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,701
I mean, I put on a concert
at the London Meltdown with Nina Simone,

401
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,546
and before she went on,
she called me to her room,

402
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:25,172
and she was sitting there in this chair,
and she was like the nastiest woman.

403
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:29,342
She had this big, white, blousy thing on
and this kind of Cleopatra make-up,

404
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,264
and she said...

405
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,342
(MIMICS NINA) "I want you
to introduce me!" like that,

406
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,720
and I'm like "OK, how do you want me
to introduce you?"

407
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:40,816
(MIMICS NINA) "I am Dr Nina Simone!"
like this, and I'm like, "OK, OK.”

408
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,027
and, er...l went out and I introduced her,

409
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,776
and she walked up to the...
to the front of the stage.

410
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:50,697
She...she was not well and it took her
a long time to even get onto the stage

411
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,741
and she walked up
to the front of the stage

412
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,822
and held her sort of fists by the sides

413
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:59,544
and stared at the audience with this
expression of loathing on her face,

414
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,210
and everyone's just sitting in their seats
like, "What is...what's gonna happen?"

415
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,582
and she sat down at the piano

416
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,256
and she took the gum out of her mouth
and stuck it onto the piano

417
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,506
and just kind of launched into this show,

418
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,224
and through the process of this show,

419
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,472
um...became this other thing,

420
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,470
and you could see it within the audience,

421
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,472
- how they responded to this...
- Mm.

422
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:24,977
...until the end she was up the front and
touching people and dancing on the stage,

423
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,610
and it was an absolute
trans-formative performance

424
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,449
and it absolutely changed
everybody in a...

425
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,740
you know, that could
pay witness to that...

426
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:34,783
- Mm.
- ...show.

427
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,536
And to me, that's what we should...

428
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:43,208
that's what we should be trying to...
to do when...when you go on stage.

429
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,547
You know, I don't know
how it is for other people,

430
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,876
but I think on some level
we all want to be somebody else,

431
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:55,008
and we all look for that trans-formative
thing that can happen in...in our lives

432
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,602
and I think most people find it
in some way or another

433
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:03,395
and that's a place that they can forget
who they are and become somebody else.

434
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,359
- By forgetting who they are?
- Yeah.

435
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,069
By forgetting who they are.

436
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,188
Mm.

437
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:13,193
And I think maybe that's what I'm talking
about with my father reading Lolita.

438
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,194
- I noticed that about him...
- Mm.

439
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,572
...you know, that he was doing something.

440
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:21,200
He was only reading this, but he was
engaged in this on a different level

441
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:25,922
and, er...and was thrilled
to read this to...his child.

442
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,540
Mm.

443
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,046

just came out of the blue.

rocked the whole family and...

- (LAUGHS)

503
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,773

and you're just this...

- Just crucifies you, yeah.

505
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,068

playing Henry VIII, you know,

506
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,984
and, er...l...l actually
become Henry VIII.

507
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,860

of England and, er...you know, that I...

508

- I could have women's heads...
- And offstage?

509
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,661

510
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,748
and thinking, you know,
I could actually...l could become Henry.

511
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,075
I could do this, you know.

512
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,702
My agent and his mum came down,

513
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,795
and she watched the day's shoot,
and I was, you know,

514
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,166
pretty pleased with myself,
what I was doing, and she said, er...

515
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,884
"Are you gonna play him like that?"

516

00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,514

me for a couple of days, you know.

518
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,348

519

as a performer, you...

520
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,846

- You need to believe, don't you?

before she started playing,

she took the chewing gum out of her mouth?

- Mm.
- Like, sort of sat down,

560
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,894
took the chewing gum out
and just stuck it on to the piano,

561
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,143
- and then just slammed...
- I have that chewing gum at home.

- I took it, yeah.

- Oh, fuck, I'm really jealous.

And, er...it... I remember,
cos Matt mixed her.

569
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,999
Matt apparently walked past her room,
and she was sitting in there

570
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,999
like, looking really pissed off
and not wanting to be there.

571
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,797
And...and he goes like, um...

572
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:32,218
(TUTS) "ls everything OK, um...
Mrs Simone?" or whatever, you know.

573
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,807
- Dr Simone.
- Dr Simone, I guess.

574
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,925
He probably wouldn't have...
Matt wouldn't have said that.

575
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,849
And, "ls there anything I can get you?"

576
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,596
and, er...she just said,

577
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:43,771
"I'd like some champagne,
some cocaine and some sausages!"

578
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:49,023

"All right, I'll see what I can do."

579
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,946
So, Matt went off
and he got some coke, some champagne

580
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,365
and some sausages for her
and took 'em back

581
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,363
and he said she just had
this big grin on her face

582
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,705
and she goes, "Thank you!" and just...

583
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,955
(SNORTS) ...hoovered up the coke and drank
some champagne and ate her sausages.

584
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:01,952
Yeah.

585
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,079

586
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,957
that felt like they were about
to fall in on top of one another.

587
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,210
- Nobody knew what to expect and...
- Well, she...she was...

588
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,428
she was genuinely frightening
when she came on...

589
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,217
- Terrifying.
- ...up the front of the stage.

590
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,514
She literally walked onto the lip
of the stage and stared everyone down...

591
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,181
- Yeah.
- ...like it was...

592
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,762
Well, I remember...l remember seeing...

593
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,016
I had the same thing happen
when I saw "The Killer" play in Paris

594
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,268
and my mate was there
and he's like...comes up to me,

595
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,940
he goes, "Well, good news.

596
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,023
"The...the T- shirt guy
selling the T-shirts."

597
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,865
And I'm like, "Ooh, what do you mean?"

598
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,818
and he goes, "Oh, I saw him last week
in the South of France

599
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,824
"and the T-shirt seller
did most of the set

600
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,405
"and The Killer just sat on the side
and came out...

601
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,328
- Oh, really?
- "and did Great Balls Of Fire

602
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,325
"and then just, like, fucked off."

603
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,327
And so the band came on
and started playing

604
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,125
and they just sounded
like dog shit, you know.

605
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,920
They were just like playing
through the standard stuff

606
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,293
and then...then it was like,
"Jerry Lee's in the house,"

607
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,217
like, "Jerry Lee's in the house", and...
and suddenly you'd look on the side

608
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,964
and there's The Killer just standing there

609
00:36:56,089 --> 00:37:00,094
looking like a kind of orang-utan,
just sort of like this, lurching,

610
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,346
and it was like that Nina Simone show,

611
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,017
and the guy walked up and hit the piano

612
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,018
and had this sound like a jackhammer,
and it was unbelievable,

613
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,025
and it was just two microphones
plugged into a Fender Twin wound out,

614
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:15,196
like everything wound out, just this sound
that's instantly Jerry Lee,

615
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,286
and he walked onto the stage, and
he got to the front of the lip like that,

616
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:22,203
and just went, "Yeah!" like that,
and everyone was like, "Whoa!" like this.

617
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,246
And then he sat down
and went, "Brrr!" like that,

618
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,165
and then suddenly he started playing

619
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,209
- and the band sounded unbelievable...
- Yeah.

620
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,754
...cos they all got in underneath
this amazing sound of his,

621
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,924
and then he did like a bunch of ballads
in the middle, Hank Williams and stuff,

622
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,342
and then he did Great Balls Of Fire,

623
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,015
and then he tried to get up on the piano
and he couldn't,

624
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,055
and it was one of the wildest things
I'd ever seen.

625
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,554
He was just trying to get up,
and then they ran up behind him

626
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,646
and they were trying to get him up there,
and he's...

627
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,607
going like this.

628
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:52,025
It was phenomenal, and then he walked off.
The power blew in the place.

The guitar player,
who was about 70 or something,

630
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,908
picked up his amp,
put it under his arm and walked off,

631
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,949
like this old amp he must have had
since day one, you know,

632
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,198
and it was like,
that's what it was like about, you know.

00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,946
First, creating the narrative of our lives

828
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,821
and then keeping the story
from dissolving into darkness.

829
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,121
- Hello?
- JANINE: We're over here.

830
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,949
Hi. What are we doing?

831
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,078
Do you mind if we go through some
of the photos your mother just sent us?

832
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,248
- Hey, are you in this picture?
- Where are you?

833
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,875
- We...we can't actually identify you.
- Well...

834
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,048
- Can you...
- Yeah, I can see me.

835
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,762
See that one with the ears,
singing their little heart out?

836
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,348
- JANINE: What, this kid?
- NICK: Yeah.

837
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,472
The one that's got "star"
written all over him.

838
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,016
(THEY LAUGH)

839
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,559
JANINE: What else has Dawn sent over?

840
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:44,023
I'm that guy with the beard
and the dog collar.

841
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,569
JANINE: Is that you there?

842
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,447
NICK: Yeah. Gloomy, gloomy, gloomy.

843
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,111
(JANINE LAUGHS)

844
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,278
Yeah, I think that's from the high school

845
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,246
- where I lived in the country town...
- Right, so Wangaratta.

846
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,457
- Wangaratta High School, yeah...
- Northern Caulfield, yeah.

847
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:03,080
...and we had this barber
that my mother used to fucking hate

848
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,581
and, er...we all used to have this...
get the same haircut.

849
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,508
He used to cut everyone
in Wangaratta's hair the same.

850
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:13,097
He used to cut an angled fringe like that,
because he thought you'd flick it back.

851
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,887
But everyone just walked around
with these things, and my mother...

852
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:20,229
we used to come back and my mother
used to rage against this barber.

853
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:25,151
That's me as a...l don't know,
a teenager or something.

854
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,269
I was not really into sport
and stuff like that,

855
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,898
and there was a bunch of us that did art,

856
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,700
which basically became
The Boys Next Door.

857
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,819
Oh!

858
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,413
That's, um...Mick Harvey.

859
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,453
That's back when he had good hair,

860
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,952
and that's, um...

861
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,456
that's me in the middle there with them.

862
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,548
That's Tracy Pew.

863
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,879
Tracy was one of those kind of guys
that come out fully formed,

864
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,005
very much like Rowland Howard as well.

865
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,179
You know, they just
sort of appeared, complete.

866
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,678
But he was an amazing bass player,
that guy,

867
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:04,103
and really the heart and soul
of The Birthday Party.

868
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,236
There he is there.
That's Mick, Rowland.

869
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,698
That's a beautiful photograph, that one.

870
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,408
There's a great photograph of Tracy
being urinated on. Do you have that?

871
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,373
Yeah, we do have that somewhere, don't we?

872
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:28,381
OK, now, that is a concert
in Cologne in 1981

873
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:32,752
and I don't know if you can see,
but this guy here is a German person,

874
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:37,427
and he... That is Mick Harvey,
you can see that classic profile,

875
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,425
and he's...actually,
we're playing King Ink

876
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,429
- because he's playing, er...the drums.
- Snare drum.

877
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,102
He would play the snare drum in that song

878
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,683
and this man here is urinating

879
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:53,611
and you can see the stream of urine
kind of arcing gracefully down

880
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,950
into the, er...right-hand side
of that picture.

881
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,070
- Can you...can you show the next picture?
- Sure.

882
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,076
And there...there he is urinating.

883
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,949
There is the stream of urine,

884
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:08,045
and Tracy, noticing that
the German person is urinating

885
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:11,211
and moving towards the German person.

886
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,958
Can you...

887
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:18,385
Now Tracy is, er...deciding
to push this person away.

888
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,183
Mick is still playing away over here.

889
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,643
Next.

890
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,981
There you have Mick
still playing away there.

891
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,976
Rowland over there
oblivious to what's going on.

892
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,320
Tracy's stopped playing the bass
altogether and is now punching the guy

893
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:36,316
and the guy's flying backwards
off the stage.

894
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,407
Yeah, it says a lot about the kind of gigs

895
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,451
that we were doing
with The Birthday Party at that stage,

896
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:47,372
because we were billed
by some promoter as

897
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,666
the most violent live band in the world.

898
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:55,885
So, what that meant was
that every skinhead and biker

899
00:54:56,001 --> 00:55:00,973
and general kind of lowlife
and, er...psychopath

900
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,841
came along to these concerts.

901
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,469
It seemed to us,
towards the end of The Birthday Party,

902
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:08,222
that it had very little to do
with the music any more,

903
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,349
and just people coming along to see

904
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,772
what would happen at that particular gig,
and, er...

905
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:18,616
we were kind of getting some sort of joy
out of disappointing everybody

906
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,032
by just basically playing
with our backs to the audience

907
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:28,125
and hunker down together and do these
shows towards...towards the very end.

908
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,797
My last will and testament.

909
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,683
OK, it seems like I wanted all my money,

910
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,519
which was nothing,
I would say, at that time...

911
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,512
(JANINE CHUCKLES)

912
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:52,437
...to go to the Nick Cave
Memorial Museum...

913
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,356
(LAUGHTER)

914
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,398
...a small but adequate room or rooms

915
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,197
that will serve
as the Nick Cave Memorial Museum.

916
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:06,413
Yeah, I was always a kind of...
ostentatious bastard.

917
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,542
- JANINE: Do you remember writing it?
- No.

918
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:18,588
It was...'87 was a, er...
it was a difficult year to remember, '87.

919
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:22,213
Eighty-anything was difficult
to remember, to be honest.

920
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,428
You know, I shifted around continuously.

921
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:29,349
I never really had my own place
till quite late in the picture

922
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,643
and I would kind of wear out my welcome
wherever I was staying.

923
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,267
But I would always have a table or a desk

924
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,895
and kind of sweep it off
and stick it in a box.

925
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,900
I guess that's why
there is actually an archive.

926
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:52,911
That is my bedroom in Berlin

927
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,754
and this room
is just a kind of crawl space, actually,

928
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,420
cos you have to climb up a little ladder
to get into this thing.

929
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,838
You can't actually stand up in here.

930
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,839
So, it was just this wonderful
kind of womb-like space,

931
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,590
which had a mattress where I could sleep,

932
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:09,264
and this is where I was writing
And The Ass Saw The Angel.

933
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:13,309
I spent quite a lot of time
at the Berlin flea market,

934
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,603
which happened every Saturday morning,

935
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,477
and I got an incredible kind of collection

936
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:25,907
of, um...pornography
and religious art and icons in general,

937
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:29,079
and I came across this chocolate box...

938
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,750
...and opened it up, and inside the
chocolate box, wrapped in tissue paper,

939
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:39,089
were these three locks,
very long, of hair,

940
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:43,302
and they were, um...
from different heads, I think,

941
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:47,093
and that's actually it in the...hanging
there in the photograph there, right?

942
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:51,310
And hair like this has always been
something that I come back to all the time

943
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,474
in songwriting, actually.

944
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,144
Do you know what this stuff here is?

945
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,352
Are these torn-out pages
or is this your handwriting?

946
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:06,530
I think they're ripped out of a book
and kind of written into. I don't know.

947
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,864
Um...l don't know.
It's just shit, isn't it?

948
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:16,202
But important shit...for me, at the time.

949
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,915
I'll tell you an amazing thing
that happened with that room.

950
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,168
I used to leave the door open
and...and I was on the second floor,

951
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:28,013
and there was this guy called Chris,
he lived on the top floor,

952
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,757
and one day I was writing away at the desk

953
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,758
and...and sort of looked up
and he's standing,

954
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:36,764
and I could see he was kind of fascinated
by what was on the walls

955
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,232
and he said, "Do you wanna
come up to my room

956
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,853
"and have a look what I've got upstairs?"
Right? And I said, "Yeah, all right."

957
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:47,199
And so we went up to his, um...
to this little flat he had up the top

958
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,363
and he opened it up,
we went into the living room,

959
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,954
and everywhere there was,
er...nativity stuff from Christmas.

960
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:57,042
He would make a star and he would
cut it out of fluorescent cardboard,

961
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:00,083
and then he would cut
another little tiny one out of that

962
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,546
and then another tiny one out of that.

963
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,838
It must have taken an hour or something

964
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,425
to make one of these tiny little...
these little stars,

965
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,844
and there were fucking thousands of them
all over the wall,

966
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,180
and I'm like, "Fuck, man,
this is unbelievable.

967
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:14,928
"This is like the most beautiful thing,
er...l can imagine.“

968
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,647
And he had all these
sort of glass-topped tables

969
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:21,563
and he kind of said, "Check this out,"
like that, and I'm like, "Mm."

970
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,777
And he turns off the main lights

971
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,488
and then shines these other ones
that come up from the floor

972
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:30,405
and they cast light
all up through the tables,

973
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,527
er...which have
these pictures of Jesus

974
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,778
- and baby Jesus and all that.
- Yeah.

975
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:36,456
So, suddenly these pictures
of Jesus disappear

976
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,122
and then it's all just these kind of
page three girls all kind of going...

977
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,540
- Wow, yeah.
- Kind of soft porn,

978
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,499
kind of Playboy stuff, which had
obviously attracted him when he...

979
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,208
- KIRK: Yeah.
- ...looked in my room,

980
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,677
and suddenly this whole room
had changed into this thing,

981
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:53,800
and it was the most incredible
kind of moving sort of thing

982
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,722
- that this lonely guy had...
- Yeah.

983
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,891
...had been working on for...
for years and years, you know...

984
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,434
- Yeah.
- ...It must have taken him to do this,

985
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,523
and this sort of stuff that I have here

986
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,109
- pales in significance...
- Yeah.

987
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:07,779
...to the kind of monomania
of this incredible room.

988
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:12,618
It really stayed with me, that kind
of power to transform yourself...

989
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,156

KIRK: One of the things we wanted to find
out more about was the weather diaries.

1024
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:21,223
Well, basically, this is
a daily inventory of the weather,

1025
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,263
and what really happened was that
I was an Australian living in England...

1026
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,640
- KIRK: Yeah.
- ...and was becoming increasingly upset

1027
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:31,392
by the relentless miserable weather

1028
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:36,773
that...that, you know...
that...that England has.

1029
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:40,946
As a way of kind of taking control
of that in some way...

1030
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,992
...or turning it to my advantage,
I decided to write about it,

1031
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,912
and because bad weather is
much more interesting to write about

1032
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,410
- than good weather...
- KIRK: Yeah.

1033
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,959
...I was quite happy when I would wake up
and it was a miserable, stormy...

1034
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,581
- KIRK: Yeah.
- ...cold, windy day.

1035
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,713
NICK: The entries sort of grew
into other things as well,

1036
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:02,340
and Susie was heavily pregnant
at the time, with the twins.

1037
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,971
So, she features in it a lot.

1038
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:08,561
There's a sequence where you see
two men in a van very briefly,

1039
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,306
and you say you forgot to write about them
until five days later.

1040
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,776
But you think about them all the time
and you question yourself in here

1041
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,772
as to whether it's because
you're thinking about twins.

1042
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,278
NICK: Ah, well, you know, on one level,
I'm a very practical kind of person

1043
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,370
about the way I go about certain things.

1044
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:30,914
But, er...there's another side that's very
superstitious, and I can tend towards

1045
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,002
seeing sort of things in things,

1046
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,124
especially if the basic day,
which...which this is,

1047
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:40,627
is starting to be kind of churned
in the mill of the imagination,

1048
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:43,005
and that's what's happening
with, er...the weather.

1049
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,597
The weather is becoming not real,

1050
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,558
it's becoming fictitious
because I'm writing about it.

1051
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,599
- The weather is becoming a lie...
- KIRK: OK.

1052
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,223
...and what's going on is...

1053
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,397
My day-to-day life is becoming a lie,

1054
01:04:56,518 --> 01:05:00,739
because it's...it's becoming
an imaginative exercise,

1055
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:06,612
and I think on some level I was
very frightened about having the twins.

1056
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:11,663
You know, I think that I was,
er...scared out of my wits.

1057
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:15,871
And then it stops in June 2000
and restarts in August 2001.

01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,623
- NICK: Right.
- Do you know why there's...

01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,000
- NICK: No.
- ...a gap?

1060
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,628
I don't know.
Maybe because we had the babies.

has gone real blue now."

01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:35,770
NICK: The sky in Brighton
is unlike anything I've ever seen.

1064
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,484
Living by the sea,
looking out my windows,

1065
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,696
I feel like I'm part
of the weather itself.

1066
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,566
Sometimes the sky is so blue

1067
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:48,867
and the reflection of the sea so dazzling
you can't even look at it,

1068
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:54,369
and other times, great black thunderheads
roll across the ocean

1069
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:57,996
and you feel like
you're inside the storm itself.

1070
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,088
What I fear most is nature.

1071
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,803
Now that it's sent its weather
to exact revenge,

1072
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,469
we're all in for it now.

1073
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,434
Soon the weather
is gonna put on a real show.

1074
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:17,399
Funnily enough, the more I write about
the weather, the worse it seems to get

1075
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,688
and the more interesting it becomes

1076
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:23,689
and the more it moulds itself
to the narrative I have set for it.

1077
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,736
You know, I can control
the weather with my moods.

1078
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,704
I just can't control my moods is all.

1079
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,621

JANINE: What happened with Kylie, Nick?

1082
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,839
I'd just written this song,
Where The Wild Roses Grow,

1083
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,257
and wanted her to sing on it

1084
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,928
and we were just trying
to find out how to get to Kylie

1085
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:54,394
and she had management
that was very protective of her

1086
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,558
and protective of her image...

1087
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,271
- JANINE: Yeah.
- ...and all of that sort of thing.

1088
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:00,392
But she happened to be going out
with Michael Hutchence.

1089
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,066
So...we managed to get hold of Michael

1090
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:06,440
and she was sitting next to him
when...when we rang.

1091
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,818
We said, "Can you ask Kylie
if she'll come in and sing a song for us?

1092
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:10,868
"We have this song."

1093
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,908
And we ended up on
Top Of The Pops...

1094
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,951
Mm.

1095
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:17,201
...and that whole event, around Kylie,

1096
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,750
kind of lives
in this sort of weird kind of bubble

1097
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,044
where life for that brief time
was kind of different,

1098
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:27,840
because we were suddenly
thrown into this weird situation

1099
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,884
of having a hit record,

1100
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:33,929
and then, obviously, people bought
the album and listened to it,

1101
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,054
and realised that, you know,
that would be the last time they would...

1102
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:40,899
they would, er...have anything to do
with Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds again.

1103
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,312
But for that moment, it was...

1104
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:46,654
it was kind of a...for me,
a very special moment in time, you know.

That's Susie.

1111
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,069
The word "muse"
I often feel reluctant to use,

1112
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:38,790
because it feels like the muse is
something ethereal and out there.

1113
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,328
It's not for me.

1114
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,919
The songs are very much about people

1115
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:46,210
and...and it's these people
that kind of prop up the songs.

1116
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:47,878
If I sing a song like Deanna,

1117
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:53,005
it's very much three minutes or whatever
with the memory of that person.

1118
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,349
Not that I have any interest
in the way that that person is now,

1119
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,470
but I have a huge interest
in the memory of that person.

1120
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:05,146

kind of memory of that person.

relationship with the camera...

KIRK: Yeah.

1126
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,381
...can be so fiercely, er...
reluctant to be photographed,

1127
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:40,102
and...it's really that framing
of the face,

1128
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:44,143
of the hair, the black hair,
and the framing of the white face

1129

telling me that he was short-sighted

1199
01:13:56,766 --> 01:14:01,397

to see the audience,

1200

he never did again.

1201

- Oh, is that right?
- We spoke about that

1202
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:10,907
because the first time I saw INXS play,
I thought that he'd looked at me,

1203
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,374
which an audience member
is supposed to do.

1204
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,994
Everyone in the audience
should feel like you've looked at them,

1205
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:20,373
and it became apparent that
he probably never saw me, just a blur.

1206
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:25,379
But he had a kind of way of
projecting outwards. I'm envious of that.

# Yeah, look at me now

1321
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:13,340
<i>#</i> I'm transforming

1322
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,467
<i>#</i> I'm vibrating

1323
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,765
<i>#</i> Look at me now

1324
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,234

1327
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,370
<i>#</i> Yeah

1328
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,006
<i>#</i> Yeah

1329
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,739
<i>#</i> I'm transforming

1330
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,824
<i>#</i> I'm vibrating

1331
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,402
<i>#</i> Look at me now

1332
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:01,664
<i>#</i> I am flying

1333
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,367

01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,665

1341

(CHEERING)

1342
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:08,770
NICK: In the end, I'm not interested
in that which I fully understand.

1343
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,650
The words I have written over the years
are just a veneer.

1344
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:18,909
There are truths that lie
beneath the surface of the words...

1345
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:24,036
truths that rise up without warning,
like the humps of a sea monster

1346
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:26,079
and then disappear.

1347
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,578
What performance and song is to me

1348
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,131
is finding a way to tempt the monster
to the surface,

1349
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,000
to create a space,

1350
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:39,221
where the creature can break through
what is real and what is known to us.

1351
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:46,478
This shimmering space,
where imagination and reality intersect...

1352
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:52,272
...this is where all love
and tears and joy exist.

1353
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:55,399
This is the place.

1354
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,648
This is where we live.

1355
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,856
