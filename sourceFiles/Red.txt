00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Don't talk about cell phones.
Don't talk about satellites.

364
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,160
Seriously?

365
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,480
Why are you trying to kill me?

366
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm not trying to kill you!

367
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,560
Oh, yeah. You are.

368
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,080
Why would I be trying to kill you?

369
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,680
Because the last time we met,
I tried to kill you.

370
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,000
That was a long time ago.

371
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,480
Some people hold on to things like that.

372
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,280
I'm not trying to kill you.

373
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,800
Okay?

374
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,000
So that makes us friends.

375
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,320
Right?

376
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Right.

377
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,520
Good.

378
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,080
You wanna take that knife
out of my balls now?

379
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,440
Who is she?

380
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,080
Sarah. She's not trying to kill you either.

381
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,520
Yeah. Hi.

382
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,120
I don't stay in the open.

383
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,160
Come on, I'll show you the house.

384
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,520
What's that?

385
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,680
Decoy.

386
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,880
He lives in a car?

387
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,720
Come on in.

388
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,200
Why do you live here
when you have the other place?

389
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,160
Let's put it this way.

390
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,560
When the helicopter passed over
the house last year

391
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,880
and I could feel their eyes on me.

392
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,680
Wet like peaches.

393
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,560
I have a list here.

394
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,680
It was written by a reporter who's now dead.

395
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,400
Along with everyone whose names
are on that list.

396
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,120
Well, almost everyone.

397
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,000
Frank, how many times have I told you?

398
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,240
You cannot trust the system!

399
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,600
I told you when you're in the system,
they switch the flip and you're done.

400
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,400
Man, satellites, cell phones,

401
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,840
chips, net, the web, the dentist...

402
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,080
Marvin!

403
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,400
That list is the one we need help with.

404
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,920
Yeah, I gotta check the files.

405
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,440
FRANK: Of course you do. Thanks, man.

406
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,080
Wow.

407
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,120
This guy's insane.

408
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,360
Well, he thought he was the subject of
a secret government mind control project.

409
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,640
This'll take a minute.

410
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,080
Sure.

411
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,200
As it turns out,

412
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,640
he really was being given daily doses
of LSD for 11 years.

413
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,960
-In that case, he looks great. Yeah.
-Fantastic.

414
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,000
Got it. Guatemala. Fall 1981.

415
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,520
Five of the guys on this list were there,
not including us.

416
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,280
San Benito. Just outside.

417
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,760
Injun territory.

418
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,920
Yeah. Was a little village.
Everybody was killed. Civilians.

419
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,720
They told us, "Go in there. Clean it up.

420
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,600
"Make it look like it never happened."

421
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,360
You think everyone on this list was there?

422
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
Damn it.

423
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,680
Damn it!

424
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,400
Do you know what's wrong
with this country?

425
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,640
They're all trying to kill us?

426
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,160
Exactly!

427
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,160
Is there anybody still alive on that list?

428
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,280
Gabriel Singer.

429
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,640
Frank!

430
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,480
I never thought I'd say this again.

431
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,480
I am getting the pig!

432
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,000
Who's she talking to?

433
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,680
Just take it easy.

434
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,880
Frank, we gotta get rid of this broad.

435
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,680
I know a great place, just up the road.
Lots of alligators.

436
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,720
We're not getting rid of the broad.

437
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,680
I like her. Okay?

438
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,280
What's the angle?

439
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,600
No angle. I like her.

440
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,040
Okay. So, they pull her voice
from the pay phone,

441
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,720
probably right now,

442
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,960
install the recognition software
and back-trace it to Singer.

443
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,120
So then we show up,
they bring out the satellite,

444
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
and we're fried with Y-rays.

445
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,880
How you doing?

446
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,920
Good, fine.

447
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,000
November niner 745.

448
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,640
Wow.
Singer is going to be in Mobile tomorrow.

449
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,400
We can catch him at the airfreight terminal.

450
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
How about that?

451
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,720
MAN ON PA: The Sunset Limited
with service to New Orleans,

452
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,280
Houston, Tucson and Los Angeles
now boarding platform five.

453
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,680
It's the final boarding call
for the eastbound express...

(SCREAMS)

455
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,800
No, please! No!

456
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,480
You smell like Washington.

457
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Who do you work for?

458
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,440
Coldwell Banker, I'm a real estate agent!
Please, don't hurt me.

459
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
No, no. Who do you work for?

460
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,320
-What?
-Who do you work for?

461
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,360
Marvin! Whoa!

462
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,520
Frank, she's one of them.
She's been following us.

463
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,760
There's a camera in her bag.
I'm gonna kill her now.

464
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
No, please don't kill...
Don't let him kill me! Please!

465
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,800
Marvin, just wait, would you, please?

466
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,520
Marvin. Look. Marvin.

467
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,280
No camera in the bag.

468
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,160
Go, ma'am, now. Now.

469
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,560
Get a car.

470
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,320
Try not to kill anyone.

471
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,080
She was following us, Frank.

472
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,440
Sorry.

473
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,360
"She has a camera in her purse,
we have to kill her?"

474
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,440
Seriously?

475
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,240
See you in a minute.

476
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,360
Gabriel?

477
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,120
Right? Gabriel Singer?

478
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,840
What's this about?

479
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,680
Guatemala. 1981. San Benito.

480
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,840
I can't talk to you.

481
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,120
Pair beats ace.

482
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,880
I got one for you.

483
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,480
What did this twice-decorated,
west Texas Jew-boy Marine pilot

484
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,760
say to the Chinese
New York Times reporter?

485
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,880
I give up.

486
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,920
Nothing. I didn't tell her a damn thing.

487
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,480
The reporter's dead now.

488
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,120
And everyone she spoke to is either dead
or a target.

489
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,480
That includes you.

490
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,400
Oh, Christ.

491
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,040
They had me fly this guy out there
in the dead of night.

492
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,000
Hairy little airstrip in the middle of nowhere.

493
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,640
He was CIA,
some dorky little spook in a suit and tie.

494
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,880
Remember that guy?

495
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,680
-Black glasses.
-Yeah. He was giving the orders.

496
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
GABRIEL: He picked up a package
and I flew him back out.

497
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
What was the package?

498
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,240
It wasn't a what.

499
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,520
It was a who.

500
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,720
Frank! Frank!

501
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,440
It's that helicopter.

502
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,720
We're in an airport. So...

503
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,440
It's the same helicopter.

504
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,920

See? Frank, November niner 748...

507
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,520
FRANK: Is that a 4?

508
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,960
This is a 4. Charlie.

509
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,080
Is that a 7? What is that?

510
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,720
GABRIEL: I'll tell you what it is.

512
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,840

have made that phone call!

-Yeah, Roger that.

That's right, old man!

517
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,800
-Old man?
-No respect.

518
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,040
Can I kill her now?

519
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,680
She called me an old man.

520
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,640
Pig! Open the pig!

521
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
Okay.

524
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,920
Boop to that!

MARVIN: Yeah.

528
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,720
Come on, come on. Hey. All right?

529
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,200
What are you doing?

530
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,840
Old man, my ass.

531
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
God damn it!

532
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,800
-Smoke and thermals. Obstructed view.
-Signal's fading.

533
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,800
Nice shot.

534
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,680
-Thanks.
-We should get out of here.

-Thanks, Doc.

727
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,240
What did he get?

728
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,200
I have no idea.

729
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,280
You just had your ass handed
to you by a goddamn retiree.

730
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,760
What did he do?

731
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,440
What did Moses do to earn a lethal finding?

732
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,760
I have not been read into it.

733
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,960
I like you, Cooper.
You're ambitious and you get results,

734
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,080
but someone just kicked in
the front door of our house,

735
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,280
so you better get your shit straight.

736
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,960
Nothing in your mission is changed.

737
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,400
-You're still bleeding.
-Mmm-hmm.

738
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,960
Must have nicked something in there.

739
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,880
This is so bad.

740
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,000
It's not that bad.
People get shot all the time.

741
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,360
No, they don't, they get paper cuts.

742
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,680
I mostly get shot.

743
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,720
We're gonna have to find somebody
to plug this leak.

744
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,480
Could go to Eagle's Nest.

745
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,880
Huh?

746
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,520
Then we all get shot.

747
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,680
I'll just go in by myself.

748
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,680
Want a vest?

749
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,160
(SIGHING)

750
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,280
Wouldn't do any good.

751
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,200
Frank Moses.

752
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,840
Hi, Victoria.

753
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,520
Are you here to kill me?

754
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,800
No.

755
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,240
You've been shot.

756
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,160
Tell Marvin to stand down
before he gets hurt.

757
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,600
Who's the girl?

758
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,080
FRANK: She's with me.

759
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,080
-JOE: Vicky.
-Joe!

760
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,120
Oh, Vicky. Sexy as ever.

761
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,080
You old snake charmer.

762
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,080
Sarah, this is Victoria.
Best wet work asset in the business.

763
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,680
And a true artist with an RPN.

764
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,320
What's that?

765
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,440
I kill people, dear.

766
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,920
You were lucky.

767
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,400
How'd you do it?

768
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,760
-What?
-How'd you make the transition?

769
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,400
Here you seem so calm. At ease.

770
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,920
I love it.

771
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,520
I love it here. I love the baking.
I love the flower arranging.

772
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,640
I like the routine.

773
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,160
Well...

774
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,200
-I do get a bit restless sometimes.
-Mmm-hmm.

775
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,200
I take the odd contract on the side.

776
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,240
I just can't stop.

777
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,200
Yeah. Tell me about it.

778
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,760
You can't just flip a switch
and become someone else.

779
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,360
Put some pressure on it.

780
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,000
So...

781
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,960
Tell me about your lady friend.

782
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,400
Makes me think that I could actually

783
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,040
have a life.

784
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,400
A real life.

785
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,760
Oh, Francis, you're such a romantic.

786
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,120
What?

787
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,440
A romantic.
It's why I've always been so fond of you.

788
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,520
Victoria...

789
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,280
You're all hard on the outside,
but you are...

790
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,240
You are gooey on the inside.

791
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,720
Gooey.

792
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,800
The entire back half of the Guatemala file
has been blacked out.

793
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,640
But there's a list. 11 names.
Plus one that's been redacted.

794
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,440
All dead. Except for Frank and Marvin.

795
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,440
All the names on the reporter's list
are in the file, too,

796
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,440
but she has an additional name.

797
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,040
Alexander Dunning.

798
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,320
Somebody's protecting him.

799
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,840
Dunning is the CEO of Browning-Orvis.

800
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,080
Gangsters.

801
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,640
FRANK: Defense contractor.

802
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,120
Very connected.

803
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,720
If the CIA is protecting him,

804
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,960
he's under surveillance.

805
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,360
We could go see him.

806
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,920
You're not going without me.

807
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,400
JOE: Well...

808
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,240
We're getting the band back together.
That's nice.

809
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,880
(CELL PHONE BUZZING SOFTLY)

810
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,000
Yeah?

811
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,600
We just got a tip. RED has a new target.

812
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,280
A tip?

813
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,560
FBI's on the scene.

814
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,080
I'm on my way.

815
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,800
VICTORIA: The FBI has a lookout position
on the east perimeter.

816
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,600
MARVIN ON RADIO: Copy that.

817
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,720
(CLEARING THROAT)

818
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,840
Alexander Dunning.

819
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,680
Pleasure to see you, Secretary Baptiste.

820
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,520
(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
The pleasure is with me.

821
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,680
They're in.

822
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,360
Frank said you wanted me with you.

823
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,480
Yes, I thought it might be nice
to have a bit of girl time together.

824
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,520
Get to know each other.

825
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,800
And I just wanted to tell you that
in all the years I've known Francis,

826
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,360
I've never seen him like this.

827
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,160
So if you break his heart,

828
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,800
I will kill you.

829
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,160
And bury your body in the woods.

830
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,200
Wow.

831
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,400
Okay.

832
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,200
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

833
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,440
ALEXANDER ON RECORDING:
Here at Browning-Orvis,

834
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,760
we have a longstanding commitment
to humanitarian causes

835
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,400
because exemplary corporate citizenship
is our highest calling.

836
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,280
As a company with global reach
and global interests,

837
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,400
we have global responsibilities.

838
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,160
Now sometimes I'm asked,

839
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,560
if this commitment to ethical behavior
affects the bottom line.

840
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,560
And my answer is always the same.

841
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,840
Yes.

842
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,480
It makes it stronger.

843
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,720
This is my safe room.
Sound-proofed. Reinforced.

844
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,800
Swept for bugs daily.

845
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,640
You could fire a gun in here.

846
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,600
No one would ever know.

847
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,680
Mr. Dunning.

848
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,920
I cannot imagine a more perfect place
to conduct our business.

849
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,880
You do know that there's

850
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,800
a surcharge

851
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,400
for any arms deliveries

852
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:49,960
to countries that are embargoed
by the United Nations.

853
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,280
For every problem, monsieur,

854
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,680
there is a solution.

855
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,280
(BUZZER SOUNDING)

856
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,680
Excuse me.

857
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,120
Mmm-hmm.

858
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,480
What are...

859
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,880
ALEXANDER ON RECORDING:
How many CEOs can say that?

860
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,480
So how did you guys meet?

861
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,920
We started talking on the phone.

862
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,200
I guess I liked that it wasn't real.

863
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,080
Of course now I'm a fugitive,

864
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,840
the CIA wants to kill me
and I'm hiding in a hole.

865
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,000
I was in love with an agent once.

866
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,480
What happened?

867
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,920
Well, I was with MI6.

868
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,960
And the relationship wasn't

869
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,120
sanctioned.

870
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,360
So when it came to light,
my loyalty was questioned.

871
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,000
And I was ordered to kill him.

872
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,800
It was a test.

873
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,320
What did you do?

874
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,200
I put three bullets in his chest.

875
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,280
Okay.

876
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,920
Who the hell are you guys?

877
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,480
You don't remember us?

878
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,840
We remember you.

879
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,680
You're the guy whose shit we cleaned up
down in Guatemala in 1981.

880
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,560
And the question is,
who did you fly out of there?

881
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,440
You don't have any idea
what you're getting into.

882
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,480
First of all,

883
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,160
you can't touch me.

884
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,600
Sure, we can.

885
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,920
FRANK: Oh, yeah.

886
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,360
Where'd you get this?

887
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,880
Home Depot.

888
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,680
-How much?
-Ten bucks.

889
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,480
You want nuts?

890
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,000
Nipples?

891
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,240
Potty trainer?

892
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,400
All right, stop it.

893
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,640
Nuts.

894
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,600
Stop it. For the love of Christ, stop it!

895
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,080
Stop already!

896
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,240
Now you got something to say?

897
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,880
We extracted a young lieutenant

898
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:16,000
who is the son of the late Senator,

899
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,600
James Stanton.

900
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,920
Robert Stanton?

901
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,400
Vice President of the United States.

902
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,400
You're saying the Vice President
killed all the people in that village?

903
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,280
Yeah. Went completely off the reservation.

904
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,400
And that New York Times reporter?

905
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,240
Did she pressure you?

906
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,800
Yeah. She called me. Twice.

907
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,000

1265
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,640
I'm at the Evanston power plant.

1266
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:27,280
You have 15 minutes to bring me Sarah.

1267
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,600
Or I kill the vice President.

1268
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,840
He just made contact. He wants the girl.

1269
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,680
Evanston Power Station. 15 minutes.

1270
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,840
You better alert Secret Service.

1271
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,160
CYNTHIA: Copy that.

1272
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,280
Secret Service is en route.

1273
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,200
FRANK: All right, come on.

1274
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,800
Where's Sarah?

1275
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,520
WILLIAM: She's on her way.

1276
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,640
(COCKING GUN)

1277
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:15,400
It's over, Frank.

1278
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,360
Any minute
the whole world is gonna drop on you.

1279
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,800
We'll see.

1280
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,760
(CAR APPROACHING)

1281
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,080
Hey, tough guy.

1282
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,160
Surprised to see me?

1283
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:52,880
What the hell's this?

1284
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,040
Alex...

1285
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:58,240
Just give him what he wants.
I can't do this anymore.

1286
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,400
You ordered these killings, not me.

1287
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,040
I don't want to have
anything to do with this anymore.

1288
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:11,080
(GASPING)

1289
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,240
You shot me.

1290
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,680
Shut up.

1291
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,600
I loved watching you being a good guy.

1292
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:27,600
Kicking ass for your country.

1293
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,840
It showed a spectacular lack of vision.

1294
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:34,280
The girl goes free.

1295
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,640
That'll cost you a gun.

1296
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,600
A life for a life.

1297
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,960
I tore up all those checks.

1298
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,600
I know.

1299
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,480
I just wanted to talk to you.

1300
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,640
Cooper,

1301
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,960
cuff him.

1302
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,400
Wilkes told me you had promise.

1303
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,800
Okay, here's how it goes.

1304
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,480
Moses just shot the V.P.

1305
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,920
You kill him and the girl,

1306
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,680
and you're head of the CIA.

1307
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,600
CYNTHIA: Cooper.

1308
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,880
This is gonna happen either way.

1309
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,840
Fuck you, Cynthia.

1310
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,520
(CHOKING)

1311
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,080
Thanks.

1312
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,400
This gonna be a problem?

1313
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,520
No.

1314
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:57,680
I got it...

1315
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:00,520
Grandpa.

1316
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,440
(GUNSHOT)

1317
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:12,920
Feel better now?

1318
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,280
Yeah.

1319
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,720
Wanna get pancakes?

1320
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,480
Can you believe it? It all worked out.

1321
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:26,160
Something bad is gonna happen very soon.

1322
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,000
Maybe not. Wait a second.

1323
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,400
Nobody's chasing us.

1324
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,840
No one's trying to kill us.

1325
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,320
I think we just got our lives back.

1326
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,600
Almost.

1327
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,240
You still owe me a small favor.

1328
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,480
Oh, Ivan!

1329
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,120
His timing is terrible.

1330
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,720
You gave a favor to him?

1331
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:54,760
Just a tiny little nuclear problem
in Moldova.

1332
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:57,800
Can we go?

1333
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,120
Yes. We can go.

1334
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:36,200
I told you
something bad was gonna happen.

1335
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:37,720
Keep your dress on.

1336
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,400
Moldova sucks.

1337
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,120
Moldova sucks!

1338
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:47,040
Next time,
your girlfriend can wear the dress.
