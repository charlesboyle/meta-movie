1
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,846
And cut!

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,730
- Wow. That was so amazing!
- Walter, you did a wonderful job.

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,211
Thank you, Kermit. Did we get that?

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,520
- We got it.
- We got it, yup.

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,807
<i>Movie's over, people.
Go home. That is a wrap.</i>

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,648
Okay, nice work, everyone.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,530
Make sure to fill out your I-9s,
and we'll see you on the next one.

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,404
So... What do we do now?

9
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,642
Well, we're together again.

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,560
We got the theater
and all our fans are back.

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,647
Yeah!

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,244
Actually, those were extras.

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,049
I saw a few tapping their toes.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,770
Yeah, those were paid dancers.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,966
Or...

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,771
Maybe since we're all here,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,721
now could be the perfect time
for you and me to tie the knot, Kermie!

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,809
Well, I mean, maybe I could.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,844
Hey, what's the camera still doing here?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,846
Oh, no. Disaster!
That can only mean one thing.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,083
Doggone it, you're right!
It looks like they've ordered a sequel.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,251
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,041
<i>We're back by popular demand</i>

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,568
<i>Come on, everybody,
strike up the band!</i>

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,643
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,121
<i>That's what we do in Hollywood</i>

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,089
<i>And everybody knows</i>

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,367
<i>That the sequel's never quite as good</i>

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,650
<i>A sequel
Another feature attraction</i>

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,325
<i>Places, please Light the lights</i>

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,050
<i>Roll camera, "Action!"</i>

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,044
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,282
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,050
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,603
<i>Do it all again</i>

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,091
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,890
<i>We got another go to show them</i>

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,202
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,207
<i>We're doing a sequel
There's no need to disguise</i>

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,081
<i>The studio considers us
a viable franchise</i>

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,040
<i>We're doing a sequel
The studio wants more</i>

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,964
<i>While they wait for Tom Hanks</i>

43
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,565
<i>To make Toy Story 4!</i>

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,845
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,968
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,520
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,369
<i>Do it all again!</i>

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,050
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,043
<i>We've got another go to show them</i>

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,328
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,127
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,243
<i>Let's give it a go</i>

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,521
<i>With Hollywood stars</i>

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,167
<i>And more one-liner cameos</i>

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,651
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,288
<i>I don't mean to be a stickler</i>

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,244
<i>But this is the seventh sequel</i>

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,685
<i>To our original motion picture</i>

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,047
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

60
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,849
<i>Let's give it a shot</i>

61
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,087
<i>AH we need now is a half-decent plot</i>

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,610
Got it. An epic love story

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,644
between a very handsome,
long-nosed purple thing

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,165
and a beautiful chicken.

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,402
<i>Gonzo with the Wind.</i>

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,647
Does anybody have any other ideas?

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,565
It's about getting the Muppets
back together again

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,645
to stop an evil oil baron
from demolishing the old studio!

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,404
Fozzie, did you even
watch our last film?

70
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,931
It's about a frog
who marries a beautiful, perfect pig.

71
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,447
And they have to kiss each other a lot!

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,171
I don't think Americans
watch subtitled films.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,250
Kermit, how about the Muppets
go on a world tour?

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,931
That's perfect!

75
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,491
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,409
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,325
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,560
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

79
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,648
<i>We've got another go to show them</i>

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,484
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

81
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,767
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,288
<i>It's more of the same
Let's give it a name</i>

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,488
<i>How about The Muppets Again?</i>

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,645
<i>It's the Muppets again
with The Muppets Again</i>

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,202
<i>It's the</i>

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,089
<i>Muppets</i>

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,211
<i>Again!</i>

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,601
- Okay?
- I'm okay!

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,961
Okay!

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,963
Booma-booma!

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,725
Hey! Pepperoni!

92
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,445
Come on!

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
Let's dance.

94
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,451
It's time to light the lights.

95
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,811
<i>Muppet news flash.</i>

96
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,884
<i>Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog,</i>

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,247
<i>has escaped from
a maximum security gulag</i>

98
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,124
<i>in Siberia, Russia.</i>

99
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,567
<i>This move
has leapfrogged Constantine</i>

100
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,405
<i>to the number one
most wanted criminal in the world,</i>

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,643
<i>one place ahead
of the mysterious Lemur.</i>

102
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,726
Wow.

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,121
Thanks for seeing me
at my regular booth, Muppets.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,928
Big fan. Huge.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,446
Dominic. International tour manager.

106
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,204
"Dominic Badguy"?

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,011
It's pronounced "Bad-gee." It's French.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,049
It means "good man."

109
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,281
Oh, yes.

110
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,720
Listen up.

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,561
You're hot. You're having a moment.

112
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,325
But what is inevitable
about a moment? It ends.

113
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,124
I don't want this moment to end!

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,720
That's why we got to get out there now

115
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,081
and capitalize on this moment
with a capital yeah?

116
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,527
I want you to conquer the world.
Do an international tour.

117
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,807
Show a global audience
what you can do.

118
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,611
Yeah, that sounds great
but I'm just not sure...

119
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,411
Wait a second, guys, listen.
I'd love to do that, too.

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,245
But we've barely gotten back together.
We don't want to mess that up.

121
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,245
Okay, I am inundated with
offers of management at the moment.

122
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:30,043
One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil.
Just some of the acts I can list.

123
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,566
Wow, that's a good list!

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,604
And now,
I wanna tour manage you guys.

125
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,967
I know you're the boss, Kermit.
I wouldn't interfere with that.

126
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,168
We would share our managerial roles

127
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,767
because you've got a special
bond with these little guys.

128
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,126
Sure.

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,121
President Clinton?

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,440
What?

131
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,763
I'm on my way, Number Two.

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,330
Great, they're taking the bait.

133
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,528
- Well, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,409
Humble and honest.

135
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,643
I just... I think we have
to get settled first, you know?

136
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,167
Hone the show, get some new material,
and then maybe go on a world tour.

137
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
See you in Berlin.

138
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,528
Yes. Auf Wiedersehen,

139
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,887
Number Two.

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,566
So...

141
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,529
What's it gonna be, Muppets?

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,011
Ready to be world famous?

143
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,128
No pressure, but I am a very busy man.

144
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,448
That's Rihanna.
I really should take this.

145
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,890
World tour! World tour!

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,689
Well, I mean...

147
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,641
I guess we could always hone our acts
on the road, and that would be okay.

148
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,046
Wouldn't it, Kermit?

149
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,602
World tour! World tour!
Come on, froggy!

150
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,601
Okay, let's do it.

151
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,769
Dominic, you're hired.

152
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,889
Thanks, Kermit. I mean, boss.

153
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,008
You won't regret this.

154
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,487
Is everybody here? Yeah?

155
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,211
Okay, guys, guys.
Get them up and move them out.

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,169
All aboard, Dominic.

157
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,242
I didn't know there was still third class.

158
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,561
Third class? How about no class?

159
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,563
Watch the heels!

160
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,563
Piggy, Why do you need
so much luggage?

161
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,244
For our honeymoon, of course!

162
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,321
For our what?

163
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,924
Let's go, guys!

164
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,960
That must be reverse.

165
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,930
Oh, well. This way looks good, too.

166
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,366
<i>Okay, Dominic, I thought we could start
our world tour in London.</i>

167
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,330
<i>Or how about
the world capital of comedy?</i>

168
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,925
<i>Berlin, Germany.</i>

169
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,521
<i>Germany!</i>

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,682
Was that supposed to happen?

171
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,285
<i>You guys are gonna love this place.</i>

172
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,246
Okay, here we are, guys.

173
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,810
The Hole in the Wall Club!

174
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,961
“Die

175
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,963
Looks like they put the reviews up early.

176
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,202
Yeah, or is that the suggestion box?

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,408
"Hole in the Wall Club"?

178
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,130
More like "Hole in the Ground Club."

179
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,201
Okay, everybody.

180
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,806
So, we'll start at the bottom
and work our way up.

181
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,804
I've booked us
into cabaret bars and coffee houses

182
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,326
all across the industrial cities
of Northern Germany.

183
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,645
Dusseldorf, Hamburg,
Mudburg, Vomitdorf.

184
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,245
<i>Poopenburgen'?</i>

185
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,164
Fozzie, we have a solid week
booked in Poopenburgen.

186
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,321
This looks great.

187
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,086
And I think we should
commend Kermit on his efforts.

188
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,171
Thank you, Dominic. Thanks.

189
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,607
Or, if I might be so bold,

190
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,923
maybe we could consider
another venue.

191
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,481
Another venue?

192
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,084
To be precise, this other venue.

193
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,810
Look at that theater!

194
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,689
What? No, no.

195
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,411
We don't have the money
to rent the Berlin National Theatre!

196
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,682
We'll make our money back
when we sell it out.

197
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,687
Kermie, I've always dreamed
of playing the Berlin National Theatre.

198
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,366
<i>"Ich bin ein Berliner."</i>

199
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,091
More like, <i>"Ein</i> frankfurter"!

200
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,690
Watch it, buster.

201
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,001
Guys, I'm not sure
we can do this, you know?

202
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,645
Okay, let's put this to the vote.

203
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,848
All those in favor
of believing in ourselves,

204
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,126
raise your hands.

205
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,490
That's not what I'm saying.

206
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,131
And all those in favor of just giving up.

207
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,803
I can't believe I'm voting for giving up.

208
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,123
Good. Well, I'm glad
we made this decision.

209
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,841
Wonderful!

210
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,887
So cool!

211
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,089
Isn't that exciting. I can't believe it.

212
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,168
All right, gather round, troops.
Everybody?

213
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,571
Okay, 9W5-

214
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,803
Since we're playing such a big theater,
let's stick with what we know.

215
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,405
We'll open with a cabaret number...

216
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,847
Kermit, when do I do
the indoor running of the bulls?

217
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,845
Mr. Kermit, sir?

218
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,766
I would very much like to demonstrate
my magnetic bomb-attractor vest.

219
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,043
Bunsen, why would you even
invent one of those?

220
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,771
Why did I invent
the unexpectedly exploding cupcake?

221
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,164
Hey, what about Muppet Ladder?

222
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,402
Muppet Ladder?
That's never, ever worked, Gonzo.

223
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,528
Last time we all tried that
was 2O years ago

224
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,608
and you ended up
in a cast for six months.

225
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,920
Yeah, good times.

226
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,244
Kermit, what if I do
four or five Celine Dion songs?

227
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,845
You know Celine Dion,
she works in Vegas.

228
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,206
No, Piggy, there's no time for that.

229
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,567
What about the band's
marathon jam session?

230
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,802
Drum solo! Drum solo!

231
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,245
No drum solo!

232
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,681
Guys, guys, guys!

233
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,009
We can't just do whatever we want.

234
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,690
This is our opening night.

235
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,127
Let's play to our strengths, because...

236
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,521
Well...

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,046
Look, I didn't want to worry you guys

238
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,687
but if we don't sell this theater out,
it would mean the end of the tour.

239
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,046
What?

240
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,281
And maybe the end of us.

241
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,761
Great news, Muppets. We're sold out.

242
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,887
What?

243
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,760
Fine.

244
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,127
I mean, great, great.
Well done, Dominic.

245
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,726
Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act.

246
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,643
It's called
"The Indoor Running of the Bulls."

247
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,485
Gonzo, I've told you,
that act is far too dangerous.

248
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,006
Actually, Kermit, I was asking
Dominic what he thinks.

249
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,766
Good grief.

250
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,763
Dominic, Dominic! Five songs.

251
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,887
"Sold out." Like we've
sold out a show in 30 years.

252
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,004
Is this a good time to discuss
our upcoming European wedding?

253
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,411
No, actually, I'm kind of busy right now.

254
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,481
Perfect!

255
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,961
I have 23 swatches
for the seat covers for the reception,

256
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,320
eight font choices for the menu,

257
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,761
which, by the way,
we are not serving flies.

258
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,410
Piggy, what are you talking about?

259
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,087
I'm just trying to involve you in
some of the decision-making, dear.

260
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,810
What about being involved
in the decision

261
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,689
to get married in the first place, huh?

262
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,649
Kermit, you never let me do what I want!

263
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,687
Oh, yeah?

264
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,808
Well, what about what I want?
What about that?

265
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,484
I haven't even proposed yet.

266
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,927
- You can do that on our honeymoon.
- What?

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,446
That's insane! Do you hear
what you're saying?

268
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,488
Insane? How dare you call
yourfiancéeinsane?

269
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,370
You are not my fiance!
We are not engaged!

270
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,601
And, as a matter of fact,

271
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,968
the way this particular conversation
is going right now... Well...

272
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,246
I'm fine with that!

273
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,206
Piggy, Wait! I'm sorry!

274
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,006
Get out!

275
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,648
Don't take it personally.
They still love you.

276
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,125
They just prefer me now.

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,402
Thank you, Dominic.
That's very comforting.

278
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,245
Do you know what I think helps
sometimes in situations like this?

279
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,401
What?

280
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,051
A walk alone in the fog
in former East Berlin.

281
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,884
Maybe along a deserted canal.

282
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,210
Well, I guess a quiet stroll
is not a bad idea.

283
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,445
Let the others know I've gone, will you?

284
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,204
Sure. I promise.

285
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,248
Thanks.

286
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,010
Corrine, come here!

287
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,371
Boo.

288
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,885
What just happened?

289
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,721
What?

290
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,924
Wait a second.

291
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,001
Hold on, hold on!
There must be some mistake!

292
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,242
Don't you know me?
I'm Kermit the Frog!

293
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,721
Silence, Constantine. The game is up.

294
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,926
Who?

295
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,491
No, no! Wait a minute!
I'm Kermit the Frog!

296
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,086
Guys, this is a mistake! I'm telling you!

297
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,961
Hey, hey! Hello! Somebody!

298
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,520
Open up!

299
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,648
I'm an Amphibian-American!

300
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,240
It's not easy being mean.

301
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,085
Has anyone seen Kermit?

302
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,521
It's 15 minutes to curtain.

303
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,646
Hi, guys. Look, it's Kermit,
just back from his afternoon stroll.

304
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,204
Hi-lo! I am Kermit.

305
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,406
What...

306
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,050
He's got a cold. That's why his voice

307
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,122
sounds a little bit different
at the moment.

308
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,246
See? Just calm down. Just relax.

309
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,926
You are right. Dominic is terrific!

310
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,007
From now on, let's do whatever he says.

311
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,804
All right. Yeah.

312
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,042
Wow, that walk
must have really helped.

313
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,202
Miss Pig, I have wronged you.

314
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,647
I humbly beg your forgiveness.

315
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,927
You're not getting off that easy, bucko.

316
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,650
Come on, Foo Foo.

317
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,523
Bad frog! Bad frog!

318
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,082
What is this? Let go, dog!

319
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,162
Animal, stop it!

320
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,801
Kermit has agreed that Dominic
is right all the time, man.

321
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,927
Good.

322
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,243
So, now that Kermit agrees
with me on everything...

323
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,169
- I am Kermit.
- Definitely.

324
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,931
Let's go and hang out backstage, yeah?

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,365
Okay, all right.

326
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,129
Come, little friend.

327
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,761
Let us get on with the show
and enjoy our family-style adventure

328
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,970
during which we shall bond
and learn heartwarming lesson.

329
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,520
Perhaps about sharing,
or waiting your turn,

330
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,648
or the number three.

331
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,370
Right, Kermit.

332
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,761
Sure.

333
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,131
Flawlessly executed. Bravo.

334
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,125
What did you expect from
world's most dangerous frog

335
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,124
and number one criminal,
Number Two?

336
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,964
Yeah, I know.
You're number one, I'm number two.

337
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,644
I think you mentioned that before.

338
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,564
Now that we control
the Muppet tour, Number Two,

339
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,041
phase one of our plan is complete.

340
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,165
We are now positioned
to carry out greatest...

341
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,006
- "Burglary."
- Yes.

342
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,642
Of all time, and pin it
on those gullible Muppets,

343
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,408
who will spend the rest
of their miserable lives behind bars.

344
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,846
Tonight,

345
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,289
we steal the painting

346
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,328
and then we'll have all we need

347
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,566
to steal the unstealable,
the Crown Jewels of England.

348
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,844
Ensuring that my name
goes down in history

349
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,161
as greatest thief of all time!

350
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,691
You mean our names, right?

351
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,364
Of course.

352
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,047
My name first, then spacebar,
spacebar, spacebar, your name.

353
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,161
Sure.

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,050
<i>I'm number one
You're number two</i>

355
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,921
<i>We're criminals at large
But I'm at larger than you</i>

356
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,890
<i>I'm number one</i>

357
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,281
<i>You're number two</i>

358
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,647
<i>I believe in equality</i>

359
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,888
<i>As long as you get less than me</i>

360
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,200
<i>- I'm one
- You're one</i>

361
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,361
<i>You're number two</i>

362
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,487
I'm number two.

363
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,682
<i>You may think that you're smarter</i>

364
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,285
<i>But I'm smarterer than you</i>

365
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,081
<i>I'm number one
You're number two</i>

366
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,211
<i>You're lucky to be number two</i>

367
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,526
<i>Not number three</i>

368
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,404
<i>I can see by the look in your eye</i>

369
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,485
<i>You want to get a bigger
piece of the pie</i>

370
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,085
<i>One day you'll get your chance</i>

371
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,924
<i>But in the meantime</i>

372
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,771
<i>You've got to dance, monkey, dance!</i>

373
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,122
Really? I hate dancing.

374
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,241
Do it!

375
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,641
<i>Dance, monkey, dance!</i>

376
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,243
<i>I'm number two He's number one</i>

377
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,002
<i>I can't believe
I'm working for an amphibian</i>

378
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,163
<i>I'm number two He's number one</i>

379
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,366
I'm number one!

380
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,363
<i>You know life's gone to the dogs</i>

381
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,681
<i>When your boss is a frog</i>

382
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,170
<i>I can see it's just a matter of time</i>

383
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,730
<i>Before he's gone</i>

384
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,848
<i>And I'm at the front of the line</i>

385
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,244
<i>It won't be long till I get my chance</i>

386
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,163
<i>But in the meantime</i>

387
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,607
<i>I've got to dance, monkey, dance</i>

388
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,885
<i>Dance, monkey, dance</i>

389
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,049
Now, watch me.

390
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,289
<i>- I'm number one
- He's number one</i>

391
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,482
<i>- You're number two
- I'm number two</i>

392
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,688
<i>That's it, kid There you go</i>

393
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,762
<i>Now step aside
This ain't your show</i>

394
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,171
<i>- I'm one
- "I'm one"</i>

395
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
<i>I'm number one</i>

396
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,686
<i>Yes, we know</i>

397
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,808
<i>- I'm...
- He's...</i>

398
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,408
<i>Number one!</i>

399
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,525
That's how it's done.

400
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,691
15 seconds to curtain... Kermit?

401
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,000
Sure.

402
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,961
Okay.

403
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,440
Have you studied
your Kermit tapes yet?

404
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,764
Of course not.
This is child's play for frog of my talent.

405
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,647
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...</i>

406
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,769
"Study Kermit tapes." Nonsense.

407
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,161
It's...

408
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,921
Oh, no.

409
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,560
Kermit! Introduce the show.

410
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,360
It's the Muppet Show!

411
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,365
With our very special guest star,
Christoph Waltz!

412
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,124
What is happening? Why am I flying?

413
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,805
- What the...
- We gotta do something!

414
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,482
Please welcome our first act,

415
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,769
Herr Christoph Waltz dances the waltz!

416
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,881
Darling, you set my world on fire.

417
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,011
Did somebody say "explosion"?

418
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,241
No! He says I set his world on fire.

419
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,925
There it is again!

420
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,363
Wait for me! Please! Wait for me.

421
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,211
One more!

422
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,651
Keep Waltzing, Mr. Waltz!

423
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,881
Hey!

424
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,602
It was vertigo.

425
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,644
Not stage fright, if that's
what you're thinking, Number Two.

426
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,721
Sure.

427
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,767
Right, now to cover our tracks.

428
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,766
Let's get out of here!

429
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,001
CIA.

430
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,286
Interpol!

431
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,840
What is the CIA doing here?
This is myjurisdiction.

432
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,331
Not to mention, my badge is bigger.

433
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,004
One of the stolen paintings was on loan

434
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,889
from the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

435
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,850
So, this is CIA jurisdiction.

436
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,570
Also, this is my travel badge.

437
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,688
Here's my real badge.

438
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,524
You must have been
looking at the wrong...

439
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,761
- Badge!
- What?

440
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,568
You've won this round, Pierre.

441
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,563
- My name is "Jean."
- Okay, Shawn.

442
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,880
It looks like we're gonna
be working together.

443
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,361
But that doesn't mean I have to like you.

444
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,726
I didn't like you first.

445
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,290
I didn't like you before I met you.

446
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,322
So, what have we got?

447
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,368
Two priceless paintings stolen

448
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,684
and one average painting
of an obscure English colonel.

449
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,162
This has all the markings
of the work of the Lemur.

450
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,241
What's a lemur?

451
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,369
Only the second most wanted
criminal in the world.

452
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,920
And my personal nemesis.

453
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,731
Unfortunately for me,
his identity is a mystery.

454
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,406
No, literally, what is a lemur?

455
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,648
It is also a rat-monkey
from Madagascar.

456
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,685
Just as I suspected.

457
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,082
This coin is his calling card.

458
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,250
The Lemur, he is playing with us.

459
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,084
I have a delivery here for Mr. Eagle.

460
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,201
Right here.

461
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,170
And here's your rope.

462
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,690
You were saying?

463
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,531
Look at that.

464
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,127
"Muppets sell out in Berlin." Five stars!

465
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,041
Kermit the Frog is liking this news.

466
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,451
Choo-choo, yeah!

467
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,570
Tunnel.

468
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,280
It's not there.

469
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,521
You were wrong!

470
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,568
Not so fast.

471
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,563
Oldest trick in the book.

472
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,725
Write it in lemon juice,

473
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,922
then simply apply heat

474
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,243
to reveal Colonel Blood's map.

475
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,168
Of course, today,
the Crown Jewels lie behind

476
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,210
the most sophisticated
security system on the planet.

477
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,846
And this map, along with
Blood's key and locket,

478
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,526
is the only way to get close to them.

479
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,921
Good work, Number Two.

480
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,480
What does it say
about location of Blood's key?

481
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,561
Right.

482
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,847
Something, something.

483
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,490
"Finest wooden teeth."

484
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,846
That is not helpful.

485
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,211
Wait.

486
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,250
There's the name of a city here.

487
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,570
Madrid.

488
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,282
You've got the wrong frog!

489
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,651
Hey, hey, hey!

490
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,731
It's Constantine.

491
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,325
- What?
- He's back.

492
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,251
What are you doing?

493
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,288
I'm not Constantine. My name is Kermit.

494
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
Constantine, always with the jokes!

495
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,409
Good old Constantine.
Always trying to pull a fast one.

496
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,921
Old friend.

497
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,606
Since you are back,

498
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,251
I guess you are in charge
of prison again.

499
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,443
Here, take prison crown.

500
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,683
We have to readjust it again.
Sergei, you get on that.

501
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,205
Take, take.

502
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,767
Thank you.

503
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,011
Wait a minute.

504
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,290
I've known Constantine for years.

505
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,521
And he has never...

506
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,647
Even“

507
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,967
Said, "Thank you."

508
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,203
Because I am not Constantine.

509
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,371
- How dare you?
- He's not Constantine!

510
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,563
Let's throw him
in the recycling compacter!

511
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,971
Yeah!

512
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,601
Throw him in the compacter!

513
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,806
But I'm already green!

514
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,006
Squash that frog!

515
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,165
Put the frog down.

516
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,287
Or I will deploy.

517
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,331
Where am I?

518
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,640
The Gulag.

519
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,125
A gulag?

520
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,248
Gulag. The Big House.

521
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,690
The Big House!

522
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,807
Hit it, boys.

523
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,720
<i>This is Russia's premier
state-funded hotel</i>

524
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,004
<i>We're very proud
of our eclectic clientele</i>

525
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,525
<i>Excellence in service since 1932</i>

526
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,205

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,841
<i>It's the Big House

528
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,843
<i>Welcome into the Big House</i>

<i>Now, please enjoy your stay</i>

562
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,326
Listen, I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong frog!

563
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,485
If you are not Constantine,
why do you have that mole?

564
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,483
It's not real. Someone glued it to my lip.

565
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,281
As far as authorities are concerned,
you are Constantine.

566
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,249
Glue or no glue.

567
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,649
Make yourself comfortable.

568
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,842
You're going to be here a while.

569
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,651
I wouldn't be so sure.
My friends will be here soon!

570
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,085
Now, lights out!

571
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,762
Turn them back on!
I can't see anything.

572
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,125
You have to wait until
I'm, like, out of the hallway.

573
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,725
It's figure of speech.

574
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,160
Okay.

575
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,806
It seems that Blood's key
is hidden in a marble bust

576
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,321
of his accomplice,
Godfrey the Unknown,

577
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,564
which is kept in the Statue Room
at the Prado Museum.

578
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,687
Perfect.

579
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,247
We break in, steal the bust,
destroy it and grab key.

580
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,971
Yeah, it's not that simple.
You see, no one knows

581
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,644
what Godfrey the Unknown looked like.

582
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,685
Of course not. He was second
in command, so no one cared.

583
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,361
And there's 250 statues in that room.

584
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,644
That may be problem.
Let me think, Number Two.

585
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,286
<i>Excusez-moi, Kerrme.
Do you have a moment'?</i>

586
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,600
Kermit.

587
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,571
I just wanted to say
that I accept your apology

588
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,244
and I'm ready to put
our little disagreement

589
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,687
or whatever it was, behind us.

590
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,321
And, perhaps, I was a little
too eager about our wedding...

591
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,482
Pig, I have question.

592
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,803
Am I wearing sign
that says "Bother Me"?

593
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,367
What was that? What was that?

594
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,407
I was in the middle of evilly plotting.

595
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,370
I do not like to be
interrupted while evilly plotting.

596
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,801
If we're to get away with this,
you've got to keep up appearances.

597
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,927
I am keeping up appearances.

598
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,809
If you want the Crown Jewels,
stick to the plan.

599
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,850
Do whatever the pig wants. Keep her
happy. Whatever she asks of you.

600
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,370
Stupid frog!

601
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,646
Stupid train!

602
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,290
I don't want to talk to you, Kermit.

603
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,608
I said, I want you out!

604
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,842
I don't think you know what you want.

605
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,166
Yeah, ldo. I just told you, I...

606
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,322
You're my lady

607
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,165
and I'm your man, baby.

608
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,767
And that's why, if you stick with me,

609
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,764
I can give you what you want.

610
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,604
<i>Baby, stop right there</i>

611
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,923
<i>Let me clear the air</i>

612
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,051
<i>Baby, look into these eyes
Let me apologize</i>

613
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,404
<i>I know what you're thinking of</i>

614
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,926

615
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,085
<i>Babe, the love ain't gone
It's here where it belongs</i>

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,365

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,411

Kermie.

649
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,082
You are what I've always wanted.

650
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,930
Excuse us.

651
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,083
But we are all wondering,
what's the set list for tomorrow, chief?

652
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,128
I don't care. Do whatever you want.

653
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,247
What?

654
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,606
Is he serious?

655
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,361
Kermit, could I do
indoor running of the bulls?

656
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,642
Sure, Zongo. Who cares?

657
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,529
Wow! Thank you, Kermit!

658
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,410
Kermie, if he can do his thing,
why can't I sing my five songs?

659
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,130
Well...

660
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,208
You can. Who cares?

661
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,203
We don't have time for all this stuff.

662
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,760
We're up to a three-hour show, Kermit.

663
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,686
You are forgetting one thing,
small man with glasses.

664
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,125
I can give you what you want.

665
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,531
All right!

666
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,329
Okay. Indoor running the bulls.

667
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,687
Won't the show be terrible? Guys?

668
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,281
I'm so confused.

669
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,321
Where are you guys?

670
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,722
Looks like I'm gonna have to
break out of here myself.

<i>It's</i> The Muppet Show,

Gonzo? Gonzo, I don't want to do this.

689
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,204
What? This is gonna be great.

690
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,486
Are you sure about this?

691
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,131
Nope. Come on. Let's go.

- On stage.

Why did the...

694
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,731
The bulls are out of control!
Who could have foreseen this?

695
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,610
Me. I did.

696
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,842
Here they come again!

697
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,329
Okay. Sorry about that, folks,

698

00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,365
I don't believe it.

700

Bravo! Bravo!

702
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,361
What? You mean you actually
like this show now?

703
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,245
No! They've made the show
even worse!

704

- Bravo! Bravo!
- Amazing!

705
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,081
Where is it?

706
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,003
It's got to be here somewhere.

707
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,003
Keep smashing, Number Two.

708
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,605
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm smashing.

709
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,648
Where is that key?

710
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,727
The last one. It better be in here.

711
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,602
He looks a little bit like you,
Number Two.

712
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,170
Colonel Blood's key.

713
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,765
Nice of him to label it.

714
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,527
- So, where is the locket?
- There's more.

715
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,325
Of course.
That's where Blood's locket is.

716
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,920
In the vaults of the Irish National Bank.

717
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,245
Then I know where Muppet tour
must stop next. Dublin.

718
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,289
Drum solo!

719
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,724
A standing ovation?

720
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,404
I am Kermit.

721
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,211
I hope you enjoyed my show.

722
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,650
I love you, Madrid!

723
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,167
Wow, what an audience!
Great show, Kermit!

724
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,006
They loved me, Kermie! They loved me!

725
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,487
Guys?

726
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,289
I'm not sure that was such a great show.

727
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,850
Like, what are you talking about?

728
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,127
That jam was, like, totally epic.

729
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,406
Exactly.

730
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,164
And I'm glad to say
the Spanish reviewers

731
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,601
disagree with you as well, Walter.

732
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,005
They loved us.

733
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,243
<i>Five out of five jamén serranos.</i>

734
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,288
Those reviews really came out fast.

735
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,283
And <i>Citizen Kane only got
four jamén serranos.</i>

736
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,401
And more good news.

737
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,643
Pack up, everyone.
I've booked our next gig. In Dublin.

738
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,850
Oh, great! Now we all
have time to rehearse.

739
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,843
Rehearse? Let's celebrate.

740
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,967
Yeah!

741
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,520
Yes! You deserve it, comrades!

742
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,604
Go do whatever you want.

743
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,045
Looks like we are busted.

744
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,041
Exactly what are we doing today?

745
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,646
I am doing my job.

746
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,964
All we need to do is look at the map
with the blinky lights, and wait.

747
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,849
This is how it is done here in Europe.

748
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,641
In America, we use 3-D
satellite LED displays.

749
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,371
Not cardboard with Christmas
lights stuck through it.

750
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,763
A blinky light! She is blinking! Let's go.

751
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,441
What is this? A toy?

752
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,922
This is my car, Le Maximum.

753
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,528
It is illegal now in most of
the EU for its massive size.

754
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,406
It's so needlessly spacious, I feel guilty.

755
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,966
I hate Europe.

756
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,044
<i>Madrid, here we come!</i>

757
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,887
- Get out of the way.
- Stay on the road!

758
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,371
Interpol!

759
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,040
Watch out, everyone!

760
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,642
37 hours. Not bad.

761
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,125
The Lemur. I knew it.

762
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,611
This doesn't make any sense.

763
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,411
Why break in,
smash some priceless busts

764
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,369
and then not steal anything?

765
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,329
There must be something bigger
going on.

766
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,447
But what?

767
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,806
I've got it!

768
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,531
Sorry. 2:00 PM. My day is over.

769
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,488
Wait. Those weirdos, the Muppets,

770
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,562
were performing next
to the crime scene in Berlin.

771
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,607
And here they are,

772
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,411
performing right next
to the crime scene in Madrid!

773
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,403
You know what that means.

774
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,721
- Yes, they love museums!
- No!

775
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,926
They're suspects!

776
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,889
Okay. Overtime.

777
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,566
We must find these Muppets
before they flee the country.

778
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,130
To the train station!

779
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,880
Hey, Larry,
want a bite of my bocadillos?

780
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,966
What the...

781
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,730
<i>Are you</i> all <i>Les Muppets?</i>

782
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,764
Wow, those are big badges!

783
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,685
Thank you.

784
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,282
Come, come. You must come with us
to answer some questions.

785
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,762
<i>Kermit, let's begin
Describe the day you played Berlin</i>

786
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,002
<i>We rehearsed,
and then we walked about</i>

787
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,606
<i>We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut</i>

788
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,409
<i>That night at 10:03</i>

789
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,687
<i>Were you inside the portrait gallery?</i>

790
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,001
<i>My alibi is watertight</i>

791
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,208
<i>The audience saw me sing all night</i>

792
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,568
<i>Monsieur, we know you did the crime</i>

793
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,688
<i>I was on stage that whole time</i>

794
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,007
<i>Ask who sang Rainbow Connection</i>

795
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,890
<i>Thank you, Kermit, no more questions</i>

796
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,803
I think it's time for
good cop/romantic cop.

797
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,962
<i>Miss Piggy, you could
end up locked inside</i>

798
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,931
<i>And now's your chance
to save your hide</i>

799
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,843
<i>Gentlemen, I did not know</i>

800
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,287
<i>It's a crime to steal the show</i>

801
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,362
<i>Tell us how the an' was taken</i>

802
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,841
<i>If you want to save your bacon</i>

803
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,684
<i>I haven't seen your missing art</i>

804
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,001
<i>AH I've stolen is audience hearts</i>

805
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,451
<i>We'll catch the swine</i>

806
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,170
<i>That did this job</i>

807
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,651
<i>Give up the pig puns, creep!</i>

808
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,722
<i>Go jump in a lake, that's my suggestion</i>

809
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,644
<i>Thank you, Piggy, no more questions</i>

810
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,485
I think she likes me. Huh?

811
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,166
I don't think your puns
are helping the investigation.

812
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,004
<i>- You know, I think they did it
- No, they didn't</i>

813
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,730
<i>Yes, they did and we can pin it</i>

814
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,801
<i>If they did how did they do it?</i>

815
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,881
<i>If they didn't how did they didn't?</i>

816
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,167
<i>If they didn't then it's easy
'cause they simply didn't do it</i>

817
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,768
<i>If they did it, then I knew it
but we've nothing that can prove it</i>

818
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,841
Excuse me.

819
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,603
<i>Let's go from the start</i>

820
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,762
<i>What do you know
about the stolen art?</i>

821
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,161
<i>I didn't know there was a plan</i>

822
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,447
<i>Your accusation's far out, man</i>

823
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,082
<i>The chances of us committing
a crime are less than .009</i>

824
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,449
<i>I can do an Elvis impression</i>

825
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,204
<i>Thank you, Muppets
No more questions</i>

826
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,447
<i>- They didn't
- No, they didn't</i>

827
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,567
<i>There's no way they did the crime</i>

828
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,961
<i>- They couldn't, they're too stupid
- Not criminal masterminds</i>

829
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,929
<i>We do not know who did it
But we know who didn't do it</i>

830
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,206
<i>So we know who didn't do it</i>

831
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,841
<i>Yes, we know who didn't do it</i>

832
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,721
They're incapable of being culpable!

833
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,521
Hi!

834
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,807
Come on. Let's go over the files again.

835
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,363
Stop digging escape tunnel, frog.

836
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,125
How did you know?

837
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,328
It's the first escape everyone tries.

838
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,327
That's the second escape people try.

839
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,160
Oh, boy.

840
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,841
Third way!

841
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,970
Give up, frog.

842
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,280
I have Netflix account

843
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,886
with search keywords "prison escape."

844
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,928
I have seen
every prison movie ever made.

845
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,809
Even the ones in space.

846
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,329
Yeah, well... Hey, wait a second.

847
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,289
That's them! That's my friends!

848
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,407
What happened to them?

849
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,969
"Dominic Badguy.

850
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,008
"An interview with the brains behind

851
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,686
"the Muppets' triumphant
comeback world tour."

852
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,761
What?

853
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,647
It seems your friends
do not need you anymore.

854
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,768
They have forgotten about you.

855
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,365
No, no, no.

856
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,528
They wouldn't.

857
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,521
They couldn't.

858
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,886
We're a family.

859
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,001
II?

860
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,084
No one believes in family
in the Gulag, frog.

861
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,960
People are only
ever out for themselves.

862
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,444
Listen, Kermit.

863
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,769
We have annual lighthearted
Gulag Revue coming up.

864
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,285
It is that, or they riot.

865
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,283
I thought you might help me.

866
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,490
The thing is, Nadya,

867
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,245
I'm sort of done doing that,
but thanks for the offer.

868
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,766
This is not offer. This is prison.

869
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,410
You are going to help me.

870
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,245
Rehearsals tomorrow, 4:00 AM.

871
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,244
Or I put you on The Wall.

872
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,801
"The Wall"?

873
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,406
Why would I be afraid of a wall?

874
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,170
Just direct the show.
You'll never escape.

875
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,321
What time did you say
that rehearsal was?

876
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,448
Okay. What about this comedian bear?

877
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,445
He is too stupid to be stupid.
He must be some sort of genius.

878
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,485
Maybe your "Lemur" hunch is correct.

879
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,924
<i>Except tor the tact that Les Mu ppets</i>

880
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,004
play tomorrow night
at the Dublin Theatre.

881
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,880
Which just happens to be next door
to the Irish National Bank!

882
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,088
Maybe your Muppet hunch is...

883
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,130
Correct.

884
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,089
It's almost as if we're...

885
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,605
Not so different

886
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,727
after

887
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,245
all.

888
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,324
<i>Come, some, mon ami!</i>

889
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,124
<i>We must follow Les Muppets to Dublin!</i>

890
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,406
To Dublin!

891
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,886
Kremlin!

892
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,527
Putin!

893
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,090
No, what are you doing?

894
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,848
- Okay, number five, baby. Blow.
- Come on.

895
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,123
- There you go. You know the routine.
- Come on, Diddy Daddy!

896
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,368
Hey, guys? Fellas?

897
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,010
Whoa, man!

898
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,691
Hey, did you see that?

899
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,526
Do you guys think that Kermit's
been acting a little weird lately?

900
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,604
No.

901
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,289
You're probably right. It's just me.

902
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,121
Bad frog.

903
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,520
Enough!

904
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,963
You're all terrible.

905
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,725
Fix this. Or it's The Wall.

906
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,921
Of course.

907
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,244
Guys...

908
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,290
It's always good to start
with an up-tempo song and dance

909
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,044
and then go into a comedy routine.

910
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,009
But we like Boyz ll Men!

911
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,846
It is Big Papa's favorite song.
Lot of emotions in that song for him.

912
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,083
I'm not learning no other song.
I'm a triple threat!

913
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,010
A singer, a dancer and a murderer!

914
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,162
There you go. How do you like that?

915
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,446
Drum solo! Drum solo!

916
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,931
When do I do the indoor
running of the bulls?

917
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,771
What about the band's
marathon jam session?

918
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,922
Four or five musical numbers.

919
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,570
Quiet!

920
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,564
Now, look! We are holding
auditions tomorrow.

921
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,404
And if any of you
have a problem with that,

922
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,326
any of you,
then my door is always open!

923
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,890
Thank you, Kermit.

924
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,361
This is what we've all
been waiting to hear.

925
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,761
Teach us, Kermit.

926
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,650
We will do whatever frog say.

927
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,723
Put it there.

928
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,566
Good night, frog. Nice work today.

929
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,926
Thanks, Nadya.

930
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,965
Even if your friends
don't need you, we certainly do.

931
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,481
Good night.

932
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,167
- Good night, Big Papa.
- 'Night, Nadya.

933
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,402
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Nadya.

934
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,881
- Good night, Prison King.
- Good night, Nadya.

935
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,201
- Good night, Skullcrusher.
- Good night.

936
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,887
- Good night, Danny Trejo.
- Good night, Nadya.

937
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,605
<i>No one believes in family
in the Gulag, frog.</i>

938
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,082
<i>People are only
ever out for themselves.</i>

939
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,921
Well, well, well.

940
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,884
What's he up to?

941
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,721
Gentlemen.

942
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,525
I need this review
to go into Friday's paper.

943
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,523
Super positive. Five stars.

944
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,047
I won't be paid off for a review.
I'm a journalist.

945
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,802
I'm joking, of course. Cash or credit?

946
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,521
- What was that?
- Rats.

947
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,604
Who cares?

948
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,160
Hand these tickets out
to anyone who will take one.

949
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,931
In fact, you may have to
actually pay people to come.

950
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,571
It's the Muppets. It's not gonna be easy.

951
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,846
And I want a standing ovation.

952
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,321
Oh, dear.

953
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,802
Where does he keep
all those suitcases?

954
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,726
Let's see here.

955
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,160
What's Kermit doing on
the cover of this newspaper?

956
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,531
Dominic's the bad guy!
Dominic's the bad guy!

957
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,921
Fozzie!

958
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,924
Dominic's the reason
we've been selling out our shows!

959
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,530
He's been giving away tickets

960
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,126
and bribing journalists
to write great reviews!

961
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,646
Why didn't we ever think of doing that?

962
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,810
I mean, that's terrible!

963
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,370
The question is, why?

964
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,965
And could it have anything to do with

965
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,123
why Kermit's been
acting so weird lately?

966
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,281
Hey, wanna see something funny?

967
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,727
Yes, Constantine,
the world's most dangerous frog.

968
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,882
Fozzie, what does he have to
do with what I just told you?

969
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,611
Nothing, but check this out.

970
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,890
Look, it's Kermit.

971
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,166
What did you do with Kermit?

972
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,051
Wait a minute.

973
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,887
Fozzie...

974
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,248
What if Kermit has been replaced

975
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,244
by this Constantine guy?

976
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,562
Nah, that's impossible. We'd all notice!

977
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,641
Wouldn't we?

978
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,401
Kermit?

979
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,209
Are you there?

980
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,926
Hello?

981
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,240
Kermit?

982
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,243
Everything's fine. Let's get out of here.

983
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,765
Wait!

984
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,208
We should look around.

985
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,441
Kermit's got a big bomb collection.

986
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,169
Looks like he's planning
some sort of comedy heist bit.

987
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,208
I hope not. Those never work.

988
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,285
What's that?

989
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,847
Oh, no.

990
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,445
What, what, what? What?

991
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,605
Oh, no.

992
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,127
- We got to get out of here!
- Yeah!

993
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,847
Not so fast.

994
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,001
Where's Kermit?

995
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,326
What do you want?

996
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,724
You have wocka-ed
your last wocka, bear.

997
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,722
- Bad frog!
- Animal!

998
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,080
- Oh, good boy!
- Great job!

999
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,400
Thank you.

1000
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,006
Quick! The freight train!

1001
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,286
Go, go, go!

1002
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,489
We got to go back! Warn the others!

1003
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,688
I tried. They didn't believe me.

1004
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,606
It's our word against his
and, well, he's fooled them all.

1005
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,444
Should we go to the police?

1006
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,284
We don't have any evidence!

1007
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,249
I feel terrible.

1008
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,688
I'm the one who talked Kermit
into doing this tour in the first place.

1009
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,048
I wish Kermit was here!
He would know what to do.

1010
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,288
You're right.

1011
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,125
There's only one guy
in this world who can save us.

1012
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,090
Only one frog who can restore order,

1013
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,924
bring justice,

1014
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,048
and set things right!

1015
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,527
You are talking about Kermit, right?

1016
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,284
Yes, Fozzie. Kermit.

1017
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,044
Good!

1018
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,361
Great!

1019
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,089
That's it, guys, that's it!

1020
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,040
That's good, guys! Come on!
And hit it hard!

1021
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,684
Okay. All right. Yes.

1022
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,886
Nadya?

1023
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,285
I think perhaps we should,
perhaps, keep it prisoners only.

1024
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,044
Of course. I just love Broadway.

1025
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,647
But you are right, Kermit, as ever.

1026
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,122
Okay. Thank you.

1027
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,921
Okay, fellas, listen up.

1028
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,090
Here's who made the cut.

1029
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,250
Sergei! King! That's you.

1030
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,925
You are always right,
my beautiful amphibian prince.

1031
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,765
I will never let you go.

1032
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,651
This is better.

1033
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,611
What's wrong? You only ever knit
when you're stressed.

1034
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,681
The bear,

1035
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,687
the little guy and their dog,
they are onto us.

1036
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,683
They got away-

1037
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,682
How are we gonna spin this?

1038
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,205
Comrades, I'm afraid I have bad news.

1039
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,002
Walter and Fonzie
have quit the Muppets.

1040
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,607
Wait.

1041
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,529
You can quit the Muppets?

1042
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,246
Wait a second.
Walter quit the Muppets?

1043
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,800
We just did a whole movie
where he joined the Muppets.

1044
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,645
Yeah, we sure spent a lot of time on it.

1045
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,721
I'll say.

1046
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,930
Maybe even at the expense of other
long-standing, beloved Muppets.

1047
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,405
Come on, Robin.

1048
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,530
Coming.

1049
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,807
Well, as the old saying goes...

1050
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,690
The show must continue,

1051
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,163
- in a timely fashion.
- Wait.

1052
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,246
Fozzie and Walter are part of our family.

1053
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,641
We can't let them go without a fight.

1054
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,960
Right, Kermit?

1055
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,929
I know this is hard, Gonzo.

1056
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,162
Walter and Fonzie
were my best friends.

1057
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,241
Kermit...

1058
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,485
Are you sure you're okay?

1059
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,005
Yes, I'm fine, pig.

1060
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,048
I could never lose you.

1061
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,971
You complete me.

1062
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,326
Kermie.

1063
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,845
Guys, come on!

1064
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,127
This is gonna be fantastic.
We should be celebrating!

1065
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,761
Yes. Remember,
I can give you what you want.

1066
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,760
- Yeah?
- Yeah, right.

1067
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,286
<i>- I'll</i> keep that in mind.
- Say, has anyone seen Animal?

1068
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,528
Does anybody else feel like
we're traveling in circles?

1069
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,731
There it is!

1070
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,041
Finally!

1071
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,561
Do you have evidence
to frame the bear?

1072
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,970
Excellent.

1073
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,446
Where are the guards?

1074
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,081
Stay here.
I'm going to check on the vault.

1075
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,847
Stop it!

1076
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,805
Colonel Blood's locket.

1077
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,690
Of course. Now grab it.

1078
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,921
Shawn.

1079
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,365
Someone's coming. Abort!

1080
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,288
I think I just saw something.
It's headed back towards the theater!

1081
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,562
- That was close.
- Too close.

1082
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,927
We need to move to
final phase three. "Wedding."

1083
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,330
Hey, Kermit, you can't go out there.
It's Piggy's Celine Dion number.

1084
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,640
Did you see anything?

1085
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,361
Not a thing. It is my lunch hour.
It lasts six hours.

1086
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,771
Excuse me.

1087
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,489
Ladies and gentlemen!

1088
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,688
I have an announcement!

1089
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,807
What?

1090
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,841
Kermit,

1091
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,687
I'm in the middle of a song here!

1092
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,091
Miss Piggy.

1093
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,528
I have very important question for you.

1094
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,841
Yeah? What are you doing?

1095
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,923
Do you wish to become Mrs. Piggy?

1096
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,926
Or rather, Mrs. The Frog?

1097
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,444
Kermie, I thought you'd never ask.
I really thought you'd never ask!

1098
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,931
So?

1099
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,530
What do you say?

1100
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,090
It's beautiful.

1101
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,289
Yes! Yes! Of course! Yes!

1102
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,560
I can't believe this! After all this time,

1103
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,242
it was finally just so easy!

1104
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,725
That's right, folks,
it's the Muppet wedding

1105
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,451
the world has been waiting for.

1106
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,483
We're putting our tour on hold...

1107
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,721
What?

1108
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,928
To be married in two days' time

1109
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,049
at the world's most romantic location,

1110
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,930
the Tower of London.

1111
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,560
<i>Here's a Muppet newsﬂash.</i>

1112
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,563
<i>The years of waiting are over.</i>

1113
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,086
<i>The biggest "Will they, won't they?"
of all times</i>

1114
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,891
<i>has been answered
with a firm, "They will."</i>

1115
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,322
<i>Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy
are to be married!</i>

1116
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,324
<i>That's right, folks.
They're finally tying the knot.</i>

1117
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,370
Well, at least they didn't get
the pot of gold.

1118
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,283
No, they did not.

1119
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,005
I have never been to
a more ridiculous crime scene.

1120
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,083
The comedian bear, he was here.

1121
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,447
The Lemur. He, too, was here.

1122
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,762
Could the comedian bear and
the Lemur be one and the same?

1123
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,083
The comedian bear is the Lemur.
That is brilliant.

1124
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,965
But why would he steal
a bunch of old bones?

1125
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,402
The bones apparently belonged
to one Colonel Thomas Blood.

1126
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,286
He was the only man to ever nearly
steal the Crown Jewels of England.

1127
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,569
Wait! Where did the frog say
he was getting married?

1128
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,160
The Tower of London.

1129
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,811
The comedian bear
is planning on stealing...

1130
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,041
- The Tower of London!
- The Crown Jewels!

1131
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,724
The Crown Jewels.

1132
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,646
Sir, where would you like the flowers?

1133
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,131
Who cares?

1134
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,321
Hey, chief.

1135
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,640
Hi-lo.

1136
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,484
We've all been thinking, and...

1137
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,406
Well, after you and Miss Piggy
get married,

1138
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,811
what's gonna happen to the tour?

1139
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,325
And to us?

1140
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,122
Well, now you guys
have all the freedom you want.

1141
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,567
You don't need me.

1142
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,369
I'm done with Muppets.

1143
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,723
But, hey, it's been a good run, right?

1144
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,209
Good luck.

1145
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,881
Kermit!

1146
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,369
Did he just say what I thought he said?

1147
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,603
What are we gonna do without Kermit?

1148
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,847
The only thing we can do.

1149
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,888
Pack up, go to the wedding,

1150
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,961
and head back home.

1151
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,686
Foo Foo, it's always been a fight.

1152
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,444
But this is so easy,
it just doesn't feel right.

1153
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,007
<i>This is my dream come true</i>

1154
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,402
<i>The day has come for us to say "I do"</i>

1155
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,410
<i>There's nowhere else I'd rather be</i>

1156
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,723
<i>Nothing in the world means
more to me than you</i>

1157
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,326
<i>I've waited so patiently</i>

1158
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,847
<i>I knew you were the only frog for me</i>

1159
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,400
<i>Always knew this day would come</i>

1160
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,087
<i>It's written in the stars
It's destiny</i>

1161
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,290
<i>So how can something so right</i>

1162
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:42,366
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

1163
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,924
<i>After all we've been through</i>

1164
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,642
<i>Why do I feel I don't know you?</i>

1165
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,524
<i>We'll settle down and start a family</i>

1166
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,082
<i>Have a mini you and a mini me</i>

1167
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,961
<i>A little pink frog and a little green piggy</i>

1168
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,251
<i>They'll learn to say hello
and say goodbye</i>

1169
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,687
<i>We'll grow gray and old</i>

1170
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,248
<i>And live the quiet life</i>

1171
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,961
<i>Just you and I</i>

1172
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,285
<i>Hand in hand we'll stay together</i>

1173
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,407
Hey. Look at that sky.

1174
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,084
<i>Forever and ever</i>

1175
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,091
<i>So how can something so right</i>

1176
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:36,770
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

1177
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,051
<i>After all we've been through</i>

1178
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,567
<i>Why do I feel I don't know you?</i>

1179
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,450
<i>How can something so right
feel so wrong inside?</i>

1180
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,364
<i>How can something so good
leave me feeling so bad?</i>

1181
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,044
<i>How can my dreams coming true</i>

1182
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,645
<i>Leave me lonely and blue?</i>

1183
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,451
<i>How come the happiest day
of my life is so sad?</i>

1184
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,490
<i>How can I feel the high
when I feel so low?</i>

1185
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,450
<i>After all we've been through
After coming so far</i>

1186
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,249
<i>Is this my destiny?</i>

1187
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,408
<i>Where is the love that's written</i>

1188
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,724
<i>In the stars?</i>

1189
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,841
<i>How can something so right</i>

1190
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:28,125
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

1191
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,444
<i>After all we've been through</i>

1192
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,810
<i>Why do I feel I don't</i>

1193
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,082
<i>Know you?</i>

1194
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,324
Oh, Kermie.

1195
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,968
- Hey, the show's starting.
- Yeah!

1196
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,365
Lady and gentlemen,

1197
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,490
good evening and welcome to
the Gulag Annual Revue Show!

1198
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,886
Escapo, you're up after the ballet.

1199
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,725
Okay.

1200
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,081
Kermit! Kermit!

1201
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,241
Kermit.

1202
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,964
Fozzie. Walter. Animal.

1203
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,690
We're here to rescue you.

1204
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,290
Yes! And we've got to go right now!

1205
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,486
Yeah!

1206
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,801
Hey!

1207
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,008
I can't believe you're here.
It's so good to see you guys!

1208
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,081
Kermit, listen.

1209
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,049
An evil frog named Constantine

1210
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,521
has taken over the Muppets
and replaced you!

1211
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,329
What? Constantine replaced me?

1212
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,401
Yeah.

1213
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,528
And he was working together
with Dominic.

1214
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,370
They're planning something terrible,
but we don't know what.

1215
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,720
But...

1216
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,083
How could you not have noticed
that he'd replaced me, Fozzie?

1217
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,561
He looked like you
and he talked like you.

1218
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,563
Okay, he didn't talk that much like you,
come to think of it.

1219
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,205
But he said he had a cold.

1220
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,408
Animal know.

1221
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,005
"Animal know"?

1222
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,811
You mean, all this time,
I've been locked in a Russian gulag,

1223
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,962
no one, not one single person

1224
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,644
from the Muppets except Animal

1225
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,405
noticed I'd been replaced by
an evil criminal mastermind?

1226
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,041
It sounds worse than it was.

1227
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,203
No. It's as bad as it sounds.

1228
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,082
I thought you guys
had forgotten about me.

1229
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,371
That you didn't need me anymore.

1230
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,807
We'd never forget about you.

1231
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,400
We need you more than ever, Kermit.

1232
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,687
Good frog.

1233
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,925
Late extra! Late extra! Read all about it!

1234
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,207
Kermit and Miss Piggy
to be married in London!

1235
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,401
What?

1236
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,081
Piggy?

1237
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,610
Piggy's gonna marry the world's
most dangerous frog tomorrow?

1238
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,889
Piggy and the gang are in danger!

1239
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,007
To London!

1240
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,605
No. Kermit!

1241
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,321
Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'm in a gulag.

1242
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,521
Sorry about that, Ivan!

1243
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,840
It's okay!

1244
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,810
No problem, Kermit. It's easy mistake.

1245
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,484
Right. Thanks for not shooting me!

1246
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,211
Sure. No problem...
Hey, nothing personal.

1247
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,567
We have to escape, guys. Tonight!

1248
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,971
But how?

1249
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,606
Kermit.

1250
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,530
Do you know where these prop
pickaxes and shovels

1251
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,840
are supposed to go
for this big mining number?

1252
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,285
Wait!

1253
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,484
I've got it!

1254
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,571
And now, folks, the Great Escapo!

1255
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,880
Oh, no, you don't.

1256
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,969
Nice try, Escapo.

1257
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,730
I sure hope this works, Walter.

1258
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,404
I have tried a lot of ways
to get out of here.

1259
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,211
This is gonna work, Kermit.
I'll see you on the outside.

1260
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,327
Okay!

1261
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,640
Gosh, I hope this works.

1262
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,169
Thank you, thank you, everybody.
And now,

1263
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,881
we're going underground.
Working in the coal mine!

1264
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,405
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo!

1265
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,365
Oh, no.

1266
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:34,540
Kermie!

1267
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,566
I can't believe that worked!

1268
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,324
We did it! Great work, guys!

1269
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,290
Now put the pedal to the metal.
We have a wedding to crash!

1270
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,486
Yeah!

1271
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,607
That's a nice venue.

1272
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,889
The main entrance is too well-guarded.

1273
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,611
I'm gonna need to get in
some other way.

1274
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,409
Here you go.

1275
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,527
You're the new guy?

1276
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,886
Yes, I am.

1277
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,200
Next time, wear a uniform.

1278
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,281
Right.

1279
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,524
Wow, Kermit, you were like
James Bond back there.

1280
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,489
Thanks, Fozzie. Okay, listen, guys.

1281
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,320
Walter, you and Animal
go look in the chapel.

1282
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,401
Right.

1283
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,642
- Fozzie, come with me.
- Yes, sir.

1284
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,882
- Good luck, guys.
- You, too, Kermit.

1285
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,364
Piggy?

1286
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,090
Where is she?

1287
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,049
Kermit, these are your clothes.

1288
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,331
This tuxedo is too tight.

1289
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,687
Someone's coming! Hide! Hide!

1290
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,005
Which room am I supposed to be in?

1291
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,530
Here it is.

1292
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,442
I hate weddings.

1293
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,926
What the...

1294
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,087
There you are.

1295
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,925
Well, don't just stand there gawping,
Number Two.

1296
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,525
Come in.

1297
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,481
Let us take this convenient opportunity
to review our plans.

1298
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,601
Once you've stolen the Crown Jewels
and framed the Muppets,

1299
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,127
ring the tower bell five times
and we will rendezvous on the roof.

1300
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,929
But what will you do
when you're married?

1301
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,604
Because the pig will know everything.

1302
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,331
Once she's served her purpose,
kaboom.

1303
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,728
It will be bacon for breakfast.

1304
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,646
Champagne fridge delivery.

1305
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,724
Put it over there on the bear-skin rug.

1306
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,205
Thank you!

1307
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,964
It's show time.

1308
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,010
Fozzie, are you okay?

1309
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,924
Yeah, I think so. How do I look?

1310
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,490
You look fine. You look fine.

1311
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,284
Come on, we have to go rescue
Miss Piggy!

1312
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,566
Right! Let's go!

1313
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,246
The Lemur! I have you finally!

1314
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,766
And Constantine,
the world's most dangerous frog!

1315
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,841
No, no, no.

1316
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,561
As you might say, case sol-ved!

1317
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,087
Perfect! Time for my annual
eight-week paid vacation.

1318
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,207
No, wait!

1319
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,727
What am I supposed to do with them
until the mobile holding unit arrives?

1320
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,801
On holiday!

1321
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,405
No, you've got the wrong frog.

1322
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,209
And stay there!

1323
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,042
And so you know, Number Two,
I have hired us help.

1324
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,922
The world's smallest team
of jewel thieves.

1325
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,606
Babies, meet your new boss.

1326
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:23,244
Genius, I know! Who would suspect
babies of stealing Crown Jewels?

1327
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,085
Look at their sweet faces.

1328
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,684
Let's see. Where am I seated?

1329
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,286
I'll need an usher.
Usher? ls there an usher?

1330
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,647
Yes. I'm the Usher.

1331
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,210
Pig or frog?

1332
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,441
What do you think?

1333
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,965
I don't know, man. Pig?

1334
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,765
No. Frog. I'm related through marriage.

1335
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,080
What kind of an usher are you?

1336
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,920
You're up, little dudes.

1337
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,365
GO, go:

1338
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,407
Down.

1339
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,841
Tip.

1340
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,601
Come on! What the...

1341
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,846
Dominic. Hey, Dominic.

1342
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,361
Shut up.

1343
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,247
The wedding, it's starting.

1344
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,369
She looks beautiful.

1345
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,040
Fozzie, we got to do something.

1346
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,162
This is so frustrating!

1347
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,765
Wow, would you look at that?

1348
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,410
Now that's a poorly made car.

1349
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,607
Let's get out of here!

1350
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:30,082
I'm just happy for them.
Really happy for them.

1351
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,686
- Would you please stop talking?
- Okay.

1352
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,646
Dearly beloved...

1353
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,122
What! Code Red! Code Red!

1354
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,486
Oh, come on.

1355
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,449
- Not a laser web.
- Pretty.

1356
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,285
Right. Go and get
the suspend-y ropey thing.

1357
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,727
- And my really cool skintight outfit.
- Yep.

1358
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,882
Shawn, come back from vacation!

1359
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,769
Constantine and the Lemur
have escaped.

1360
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,524
The Crown Jewels are in danger!

1361
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,047
We are gathered here today
to witness the union

1362
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,329
of this pig and this frog

1363
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,803
in Holy Matrimony
before the presence of God.

1364
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,888
Do you, Kermit the Frog,

1365
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,129
take Miss Piggy to be
your lawfully wedded wife,

1366
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,729
in sickness and in health,
so help you God?

1367
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,763
Yes. Yes, I do.

1368
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,764
And do you, Miss Piggy,

1369
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:26,731
take Kermit the Frog
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

1370
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,963
in sickness and in health,
so help you God?

1371
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,561
L.-

1372
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,881
L.-

1373
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,365
Just say "I do."

1374
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,283
This is
what you've always wanted, right?

1375
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,607
I do?

1376
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,250
I'm sorry, is that a question?

1377
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,288
No, it was not a question.

1378
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,120
We have to do something, guys.

1379
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,090
Kermit, we've got to
get you close to Miss Piggy!

1380
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,844
What does this do?

1381
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,884
- What the...
- Piggy, it's me, Kermit.

1382
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,849
Come on, we have to get out of here!
The wedding is off.

1383
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,160
Oh, wow!

1384
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,925
Like, I kind of knew
he'd get cold flippers.

1385
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,886
Excuse us.

1386
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,606
No, Kermit! What are you doing?

1387
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,728
- Piggy, I will explain later.
- I cannot believe...

1388
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,404
Come here, frog!

1389
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,606
Where you going?

1390
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,087
I'm sorry, my dear, forgive me.

1391
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,202
What is going on at my wedding?

1392
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,725
- Gotcha!
- What?

1393
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,207
Animal, pull!

1394
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,521
What is happening here?

1395
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,762
Catch froggie! Catch froggie!

1396
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,201
Well, this is the best
Muppet wedding ever!

1397
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,647
Piggy, listen! That's not me! I'm me!

1398
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,088
He's Constantine,
the world's most dangerous...

1399
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,729
Two Kermits?

1400
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,969
Well, that explains a lot.

1401
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,089
How can there be two Kermits?

1402
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,369
Of all the ways to ruin a wedding,
this has got to be the most creative.

1403
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,566
Two Kermits!

1404
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,211
No, just one Kermit. Me.

1405
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,647
No, no, no. Do not listen to him!

1406
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,643
I am the real Kermit.

1407
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,688
That's ridiculous! I am Kermit the Frog!

1408
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,081
No, I am Kermit the Frog!
Hi-lo, Kermit the Frog, here.

1409
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,446
"Hi-lo?" It's "Hi-ho!"

1410
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,806
Would every Kermit be quiet!

1411
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,440
Well, there's only one sure way
to settle this.

1412
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,521
First Kermit.

1413
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,247
Will you marry me?

1414
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,687
Yes, of course, let's go!

1415
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,081
The helicopter is waiting, my love!

1416
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,686
And you, the other Kermit...

1417
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,090
Will you marry me?

1418
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,401
Well, I mean, I...

1419
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,926
I would. I mean, I could. It's...

1420
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,650
That's my Kermit!

1421
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:50,961
That's our frog!

1422
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,486
Kissy-kissy!

1423
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,011
That is right, Muppets!

1424
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,364
I am Constantine,

1425
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,650
the world's most dangerous frog
and number one criminal!

1426
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:19,682
And a thousand times more frog
than this Kermit person!

1427
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,922
And now,

1428
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,562
I have only one thing to say to you fools!

1429
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,930
Good night, folks!

1430
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,210
What is that?

1431
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,691
It's a bomb!

1432
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,651
This is where my patented magnetic
bomb-attractor vest can aid us,

1433
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,007
that Beaker is conveniently wearing.

1434
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,922
What? What's going on?

1435
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,210
Wait! Miss Piggy's ring is the bomb!

1436
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,090
Some of you guys grab Piggy,
and some of you guys grab me.

1437
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,241
Pull!

1438
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,722
That's only 800 years old.

1439
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,010
Nicely done, Beaker!

1440
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,841
Kermit! Help!

1441
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,081
- F'i99v!
- Help!

1442
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,491
She's on the roof!

1443
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,809
Shut up and keep moving, pig!
You are my insurance policy!

1444
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,289
Number Two, you look ridiculous.

1445
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,050
Why are you wearing that?

1446
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,724
Because I am the Lemur.

1447
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,326
And the world's
new number one criminal.

1448
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,487
That's right.

1449
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,164
This is where I double-cross you.

1450
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,049
First rule of double-cross.

1451
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:00,403
You don't announce the double-cross
before you double-cross.

1452
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,131
It's not even a rule
because it is so obvious.

1453
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:11,007
The Lemur is literally the worst bad guy
name I have ever heard!

1454
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,121
Let's go!

1455
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,920
Oh, no!

1456
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,048
He's getting away!
What are we gonna do?

1457
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,849
I'm gonna stop that helicopter.

1458
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,243
We're coming!
Hang on, Miss Piggy!

1459
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,845
Jump!

1460
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,081
Shut up, pig!

1461
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,400
Kermit!

1462
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,606
We have to do something!

1463
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,681
' Qot it!

1464
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,601
There's only one way
we can reach him up there!

1465
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,801
Muppet Ladder!

1466
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,211
- What the...
- Kermit!

1467
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,646
Come on up, Chef!

1468
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,209
Watch the hair, bear.

1469
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,606
Give up, Constantine. I've got you now!

1470
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,047
Bad move, frog.

1471
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,801
Kermit!

1472
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,360
Okay, Kermit, we're coming to get you.

1473
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:57,441
Now!

1474
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,806
No, something's wrong.

1475
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,405
We're not moving.

1476
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,043
You're ruining my getaway!

1477
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,644
Hang on, Piggy! I'm coming!

1478
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,290
Go get 'em, Kermit!

1479
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,041
Kermie!

1480
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,725
Welcome aboard, Kermit.

1481
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,644
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1482
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,087
I am the world's most dangerous frog.

1483
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,005
Oh, brother!

1484
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,242
You may be
the world's most dangerous frog,

1485
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,685
but you're still a frog!

1486
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,849
No one tricks me into marrying them

1487
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,606
and then hurts my Kermie!

1488
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,083
What a woman!

1489
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,810
Yeah. My woman.

1490
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,724
And I believe this belongs to you.

1491
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,282
Well, I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.

1492
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,965
Oh, Kermie.

1493
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:12,202
I'm so glad you did.

1494
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,566
Okay. Can we get down now?

1495
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,126
We did it, guys!

1496
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,850
What an action sequence!

1497
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,285
You sure look pretty, Miss Piggy.

1498
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,726
Thank you.

1499
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:35,202
Congratulations, weirdos,
you've saved the Crown Jewels!

1500
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,561
And you've caught my nemesis,
the Lemur.

1501
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,961
Look at his little costume.
That's adorable!

1502
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,048
- I'm not adorable.
- He is adorable.

1503
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,400
You're adorable!

1504
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:44,891
Did you make that kitty-cat outfit?

1505
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,203
The bad guy is Dominic Badguy!

1506
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:53,169
Well, <i>mon</i> ami, I guess
this is where we say goodbye.

1507
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,086
You go your way, and I go mine.

1508
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:59,365
Here comes the rain. Oh, boy.

1509
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,363
And I said I wasn't going to do this.

1510
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,761
Pull yourself together, man.
Stop crying.

1511
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,730
We're only saying our final farewell.

1512
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,570
Goodbye forever!

1513
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,085
I'm going to miss you so much!

1514
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:14,845
I'm going to miss you, my French friend.

1515
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,531
Whenever you're ready.

1516
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,360
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

1517
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:22,203
- Take them away!
- Take them away!

1518
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,282
- Thank you.
- Au revoir, Muppets.

1519
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,601
'Bye-bye.
- See you!

1520
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,766
<i>You're number two</i>

1521
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:29,921
- Sam.
- Shut up.

1522
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,280
Sam! Wait for me!

1523
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,802
You know, I missed all of you so much.

1524
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,769
There he is, right there!

1525
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,571
Arrest him! Arrest that frog!

1526
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,648
Nadya? Wait. For what?

1527
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,327
For leading the largest
mass break-out in Gulag history.

1528
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,643
You will get 30 years. Maybe 50.

1529
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,200
- But“
- No "buts," Kermit.

1530
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,205
You didn't finish Gulag Annual Revue,
and you didn't even say goodbye.

1531
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:02,651
- What?
- What?

1532
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,927
You are coming with me. Now, move!

1533
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,968
Fellas, listen. Easy.

1534
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,407
No, no, no! Kermit!

1535
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,330
Wait!

1536
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,003
We're sorry, Kermit.

1537
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,080
We're sorry that
we didn't notice you were missing.

1538
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,324
We're sorry we didn't tell you
often enough

1539
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,926
how much you mean to all of us.

1540
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,890
We're sorry we ever
took you for granted.

1541
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,121
But that's never going to happen again.

1542
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,205
Because if Kermit
has to go back to the gulag,

1543
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,249
you'll have to take me, too.

1544
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,161
No.

1545
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:48,002
You're my best friend, Kermit.
Wherever you go, I go.

1546
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,442
You'll have to take me, too.

1547
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,441
And me.

1548
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,762
Kermit, we convinced ourselves
that evil frog was you

1549
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,766
because he gave us
what we thought we wanted.

1550
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,723
When what we really wanted...

1551
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,690
What we really needed...

1552
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,723
Was you, Kermit.

1553
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,725
The actual, real you.

1554
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,802
It would appear you were right, Kermit.

1555
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,929
I guess this is your family.

1556
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,610
And families belong together.

1557
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,766
You are free to go.

1558
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,606
Forever.

1559
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,480
Kermit, did you hear that? We're free!

1560
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,847
Nadya, thank you! Great!

1561
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,570
That's wonderful!

1562
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,286
Wait!

1563
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,243
Hey, guys, listen.
We still have to finish our world tour.

1564
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,846
And I know where we need to play next.

1565
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,604
For one night only,

1566
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,523
Siberia, Russia!

1567
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:07,004
Yes, yes!
I'll pack my swimsuit right away!

1568
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,443
Wonderful!

1569
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:13,683
It's terrible.
You will hate it. You will hate it.

1570
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,884
Okay, guys, this is it. The Gulag Finale!

1571
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,081
Here we go!

1572
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,288
A-one, two, three, four!

1573
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,281
<i>Together again, again</i>

1574
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:38,570
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

1575
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,201
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

1576
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:47,080
<i>It's not starting over
It's just going on</i>

1577
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,561
<i>Together again, again</i>

1578
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,641
<i>Now we're here</i>

1579
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:54,611
<i>And there's no need
remembering when</i>

1580
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:58,526
<i>Because no feeling
feels like that feeling</i>

1581
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,324
<i>Together again</i>

1582
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,721
<i>Again, again, again!</i>

1583
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,929
<i>Together again, again</i>

1584
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,085
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

1585
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,764
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

1586
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,444
<i>It's not starting over</i>

1587
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,324
<i>It's just going on</i>

1588
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,323
<i>Together again, again</i>

1589
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,601
<i>Now we're here</i>

1590
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:26,251
<i>And there's no need
remembering when</i>

1591
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:30,287
<i>'Cause no feeling feels like that feeling</i>

1592
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,484
<i>Together again</i>

1593
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,607
<i>Again</i>

1594
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,810
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

1595
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:57,851
<i>It's not starting over
It's just going on</i>

1596
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,570
<i>Together again, again</i>

1597
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:04,009
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

1598
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:07,721
<i>'Cause no feeling feels like that feeling</i>

1599
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:11,647
<i>Together a-.</i> ..

1600
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:15,281
<i>Together again!</i>

1601
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,243
Okay, Nadya, this is it. Your solo.

1602
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,727
<i>Kermit!</i>

1603
01:41:01,041 --> 01:41:02,247
Oh, boy.

1604
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,286
- Hey, pull the rope!
- Oh, right.

1605
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,083
This cast is really heavy.

1606
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:12,961
<i>Row“, come here.
Come here, come here.</i>

1607
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,041
Yeah, what do you got there?

1608
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,167
Take this.

1609
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,167
You should have negotiated
a smaller font size.

1610
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,690
I believe I may have
something that could help.

1611
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:40,128
This is my automated
end-crawl operating machine.

1612
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:44,603
All I have to do is push this button
and it will crawl all by itself.

1613
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,850
Let's try this.

1614
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:57,011
Another qualified success.

1615
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,286
Check this out.

1616
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,489
You can go home now, Ma.
The movie is over.
