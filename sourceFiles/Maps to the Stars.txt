2
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,650
I'm Agatha Weiss.
I asked for a limousine.

3
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,860
A stretch?

4
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,660
Um.

5
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,830
Yeah, there weren't any available.

6
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,520
Can you find this place?

7
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,240
Yeah.

8
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,350
Ah...

9
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,760
Look, cash call.
I'm gonna have to collect up front.

10
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,000
It's 45 an hour.
2 hour minimum.

11
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,310
Here's 200, okay?

12
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,510
Can we get a star home map?

13
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,020
Kind of a waste.

14
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,420
Unless you want to see
where Ryan Seacrest used to live?

15
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,080
Where did you come in from?

16
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,270
Jupiter.

17
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,150
Florida.

18
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,160
What's happening in LA?

19
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,030
Visiting family.

20
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,000
Do you drive a lot of celebrities?

21
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,000
I had Al Gore once.

22
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,970
That was probably the heaviest....
for me.

23
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,300
I drove Tatum O'Neil when
she had a reality show.

24
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,520
Umm...

25
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,990
Chuck Lorre...

26
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,990
... who created 2 1/2 Men.

27
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,840
Get a lot of producers...
directors.

28
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,630
Eh... Juliette Lewis.

29
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,630
She's a scientologist.

30
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,920
I was thinking about converting.

31
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,820
Just as a carrier move.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,530
You're an actor?

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,440
Actor, writer.

34
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
I know Carrie Fisher.

35
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,820
Oh, really?

36
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,510
How's that?

37
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,290
I met her on Twitter.

38
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,610
Yeah, we became like really good friends.

39
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,610
I'm helping her with
a new novel she's writing.

40
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,650
But it might be something she
winds up doing as an HBO show.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,620
What's this place?

42
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,960
I thought it might be on a star map.

43
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,720
There used to be a
really big house here.

44
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,090
Childhood home of Benjie Weiss.

45
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,250
So, how do you know that?

46
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,110
I used to babysit for him.

47
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,170
I was the original bad babysitter.

48
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,570
It's weird.

49
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,490
My agent is trying to get me
an audition for babysitter 2.

50
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,630
I mean it's a long shot, but uh...

51
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,200
Jacob Lightner...

52
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,500
... got it to me...
he's a personal manager.

53
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,100
He's a real heavy-weight.

54
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,020
We went to Beverly together.

55
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,030
I hold my fingers crossed.

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,790
Hi, there.

57
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,630
I'd didn't think you'd come.

58
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,910
Why is that?

59
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,980
You're so busy.

60
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,310
Not for you.

61
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,050
Hm.

62
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,970
I, um...

63
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,630
I... I liked 'Bad Babysitter'.
You were so funny.

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,020
Yeah... uh....

65
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,990
We did 780 million world wide.

66
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,110
People don't realize that.

67
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,980
Don't you have an iPad?

68
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,080
No...

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,630
Um... can we get her an iPad?

70
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,640
Mini?

71
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,250
Load it up?

72
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,520
Watch shit in 3D?

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
We got great sack in crew jackets.

74
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,410
'I was a Bad Babysitter'
written in gold on the back.

75
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,270
Get your swag on.

76
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,920
So...

77
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,240
How did you get AIDS, Cammy?

78
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,250
Umm...

79
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,590
I don't have AIDS, its...

80
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,480
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

81
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,770
You know what
I'm going to do?

82
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,190
I'm gonna make a movie of your life.

83
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,900
Right?

84
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,670
Ryan Gosling will play me.

85
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,090
And I'll play you.

86
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,800
You're my date at the Oscars.

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,140
Non-Hodgekin's?

88
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,080
Sorry about that.

89
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,660
- What the fuck is Non-Hodgekin's?
- I think it's a blood thing.

90
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,860
I mean, 'Non'.
It either is or isn't.

91
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,710
Were you serious in there?

92
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,550
Because...

93
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,240
... we can definitely get this to Ryan.

94
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,284
- It's just the kind of stuff he likes to do.
- We could get it to Ryan?

95
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:22,680
Yeah.

96
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,370
You can barely get
toilet paper to your ass.

97
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,470
Make for an uplifting drama,
wouldn't it?

98
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,090
I mean, I even got a title.

99
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,520
'It's A Horrible Life'.

100
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,040
If you're not serious Benjie,
it's better not to promise.

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,390
Hah!

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,180
Arnold Kugler Ross has spoken!

103
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,120
Great Rabi, death and dieing.

104
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,250
Man of wisdom.

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,810
Zen-fucking-archer!

106
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,220
I got a new nickname for you.

107
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,360
Uzeem Atolerance.

108
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,640
Drop it Benjie.

109
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,730
Drop it?

110
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,620
I have a better idea.

111
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,870
Why don't you show
me your cunt?!

112
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,110
Huh?!

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,740
I know you have one.

114
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,680
Jew faggot!

115
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,580
What are they offering?

116
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
5 million.

117
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,510
10 points from Cashbury.

118
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,460
What's Genie asking?

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,750
8.

120
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,870
20 from dollar one.

121
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
What do you think?

122
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,650
I think we have their balls...

123
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,240
Cool.

124
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,760
So um...
when's the audition?

125
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,990
It's not an audition Benjie.
I told you that.

126
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,360
Right. Sorry.

127
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,570
When's the urine test?

128
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,640
The <i>meeting</i> is on Friday at 10.

129
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,180
The studio just want to see that
you're bright eyed and bushy tailed.

130
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,610
But the deals contingent belong to me?

131
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,470
They just want to protect the franchise.

132
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,760
I <i>am</i> the franchise.

133
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,020
Goo-goo-ga-joo.

134
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,480
Stafford, are you gonna to eat?

135
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,620
I was listening to a very interesting tape
of the Dalai Lama on the way home.

136
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,470
Say what you like about politics....

137
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,340
... the <i>man</i> is a pro.

138
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,070
Free Tibet!

139
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,040
Tibet is not free.
Tibet is very expensive.

140
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,370
I have the receipt
from amazon to prove it.

141
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,480
Anyhow...

142
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,400
Buddhists say a prayer...

143
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,690
Is Genie gonna be there?

144
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,060
She thinks it's better not.

145
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,860
I want her there.

146
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,840
Pray... that those that eat...

147
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,790
... the things that are eaten
and the actual eating...

148
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,210
... be universally devote herself.
Don't you love it?

149
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,350
I'm going to my room.

150
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,220
Goo-goo-ga-joo.

151
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,740
<i>Don't mama...</i>

152
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,360
Don't mama...

153
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,830
<i>Don't hurt me like that. </i>

154
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,300
Don't hurt me like that.

155
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,830
<i>Don't come into my room. </i>

156
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,740
Don't...

157
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,420
Don't come into my room.

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
<i>When I'm sleeping.</i>

159
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,280
Don't come into my room
when I'm sleeping.

160
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,590
<i>- I won't let you anymore. </i>
- I won't let you anymore.

161
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,370
You mother fucker.

162
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,640
You mother...FUCKER!

163
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,050
You... you hurt me.

164
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,480
How?

165
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,970
How did I hurt you?

166
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,290
I was your little girl...

167
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,290
I was your...
I was your little girl.

168
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,540
And... and you hurt me.

169
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,820
Why did you do it, mama?

170
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,360
Because your parents hurt you?

171
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,460
That's not good enough!

172
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,350
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

173
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,840
Come on, Havana, stop forgetting!

174
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,240
I don't...
I don't care what they did to you.

175
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,610
I wish they'd... killed you.

176
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,920
I... I'd kill you myself, mama.

177
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,370
How... how could you
do that to a child?

178
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,830
How could you do...
what you did to me?

179
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,950
I want to be free Clarice.

180
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,370
I want to be free.

181
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,670
Clarice, mama...

182
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,040
Mama, mama.

183
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,480
Set me free!

184
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,890
I will be free.

185
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,810
We will take back the years you stole.

186
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,420
Please...

187
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,320
Please... please...

188
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,400
I'm gonna press on a
personal history point.

189
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,620
Everything is stored in thighs.

190
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:05,180
Okay.

191
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,350
Take back the years, Havana.

192
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,020
Take back the years she
stole from that little girl.

193
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Release.

194
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,990
Rebeca, we need to stop.

195
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,470
You're a patient here.

196
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,316
I want to help you,
not make you things...

197
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:37,020
You don't think I set
those fires, do you?

198
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,480
I think that you didn't mean to.

199
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,640
You need help.
That's all.

200
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,390
Don't you wanna help me?

201
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,310
Not like this.

202
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,540
I think that we need to
think about what we're doing.

203
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,090
On all the flesh that says yes.

204
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,730
On the forehead of all my friends.

205
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,010
On every hand held out.

206
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,740
I write your name.

207
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,800
Ms. Havana?
It's Ms. Genie.

208
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,080
- How you doing, baby?
- Eh, I'm okay.

209
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,000
I really had a session with Stafford.

210
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,120
That is so brave, what you do.

211
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,980
Doesn't feel brave.

212
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,430
I need a new chore whore.

213
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,220
What do ...
what happened to Adaggio?

214
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,400
Ahh... I had to fire her.

215
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,700
You're kidding!
What happened?

216
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
She was stealing.

217
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,720
Adaggio?!

218
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,590
Oh God, I don't believe it.

219
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,910
Yeah, yeah. She took some money
and a ring I got last year in Paris

220
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,130
and some Vicodin.

221
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,360
Oh my God!

222
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,510
- What did you caught her?
- Um.-hmm.

223
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,280
So what did you call the police?

224
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,370
Yeah, I told her I would
if she didn't go to rehab.

225
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
I see that she's there now, huh?

226
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,780
Yeah, with the all the other
dope fiend personal assistants.

227
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,510
They have there own wing.

228
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,680
Okay, well, I call Carry again.

229
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,170
Um, love her, love Carrie
but don't bother her with this shit!

230
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,670
She'll think it's hilarious.

231
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,470
I'm meeting her later at the J.J. thing.

232
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,470
She'll give me some names.

233
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,360
So, umm...

234
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,190
What's going on with 'Stolen Waters'?

235
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,160
Well, I called Vita but you know,
they're all at Sundance.

236
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,260
Yeah, everyone but me!

237
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,970
I gave the best reading
of my life, Genie!

238
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,020
I went in there and
I blow everyone away!

239
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,820
I know, I know.

240
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
I mean, you know,
the only thing I can think of was that

241
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,930
they maybe they have some concerns
about the perception of stunt casting.

242
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,320
Everything is stunt casting.

243
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,600
Havana...

244
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,980
... this is a movie and not a great one...

245
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,360
... that your mother made.
30 years ago!

246
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,180
No, no.
But it could be... it could be...

247
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,720
Great! It's a , it's a re-imagining.

248
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,030
It's a fucking art film!

249
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,480
I mean, who do you think
came up with the idea of

250
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,220
my mother looking back on
the making of 'Stolen Waters'

251
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,290
if she had lived?
I did. I did!

252
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,940
I mentioned it to Damien
4 years ago in Mystique.

253
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,750
I know, I know.

254
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,720
They should give me the part.

255
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,670
And, and a producers credit too.
I mean this role was...

256
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,660
... made for best supporting. It's...

257
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,360
It's... it's a fucking second chance.

258
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,410
And it's, it's Damien Javitz.

259
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,410
He totally resurrects actors.

260
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,380
And I went in there and I killed it.

261
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,480
Sterl still doing it?

262
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,500
Yeah...

263
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,050
Yeah, he owes me.

264
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,760
I introduced him to Harvey and

265
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,090
you know Harvey is producing and I mean,
I already talked to Harvey and

266
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,890
He's gonna to talk to Damien
but you know...

267
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,960
Harvey is Harvey, but...

268
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,840
Sterl can talk to Damien?

269
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,400
You know we are doing
everything we can but

270
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
you know, at the end of the day,
it's an art film.

271
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,660
I mean it will be great if you got the job.

272
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,450
But in case you're not aware

273
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,920
your mother is a dead cult figure.

274
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,920
A Damien Javitz.

275
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,240
8 P.D. Andersson.

276
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,470
I mean they're so many movies out there!

277
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,260
Yeah, where?!

278
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,850
- Big deal movies!
- Where?

279
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,460
Where? Where Genie?!

280
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Do you know what Jacob said
to me the other day?

281
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,280
he said that because
I know so many celebrities

282
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,700
I should consider becoming a manager!

283
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,020
Do you know,
do you know how it felt

284
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,370
for me to hear that?!

285
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,810
Look, everything I am doing

286
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,620
everything in my life

287
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,110
and in my therapy is to get this part...

288
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,500
- Ow!
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

289
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,890
- Ow, cramps.
- Are you okay?

290
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,400
No, not okay!

291
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,610
Mother daughter incest
is so 80's overkill.

292
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,980
And sexton I am not.

293
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,930
Oh my God. Oh my God!

294
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,250
The shock will wear off.

295
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,420
What's the matter, Havana?

296
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,140
Did you think it would be
like the 'Sixth Sense'

297
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,510
with the dead clambering to be heard?

298
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,520
Do you know what the dead clamber for?

299
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,700
You know what hell is?

300
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,550
A world without narcotics.

301
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,660
What's happening?
What's happening?

302
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,040
Worst pornographically shaven at this

303
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
childhood rape fantasy.
Get a life!

304
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,600
Maybe you should get a dad.

305
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,120
Isn't it pathetic enough
that you want to play me?

306
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,360
You HATE me.

307
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,740
That yet you are desperate to be me?

308
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,920
You want that role
that you're not gonna get.

309
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,620
You don't even have the chops.

310
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,320
I did.
And I was young and gorgeous.

311
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,170
You?!

312
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,060
With your shitty tits and
that used up old hole!

313
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,930
It STINKS worse than me!

314
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,960
No! No...

315
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,380
Who is it?

316
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,720
It's Non-Hodgkin's.

317
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,160
What are you doing here?

318
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,390
On my school notebooks.

319
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,730
On my desk, in the trees.

320
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,080
On the sand, in the snow.

321
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,420
I write your name.

322
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,370
I'll... I'll make the movie.

323
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,600
If that's why you're here.
I don't know what Marlon told you...

324
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,400
On all the flesh that says yes.

325
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,400
On the forehead of my friends.
On every hand held out.

326
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,500
I write your name.

327
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,180
In my school notebook.

328
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,180
On my desk and on the trees.

329
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,740
On the sand and
in the snow, I write your name.

330
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,190
On all the flesh that says yes.

331
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,190
On the forehead of my friends.

332
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,500
On every hand held out,
I write your name.

333
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,220
Liberty.

334
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,090
So, we're back to school with 'Bad Babysitters'.

335
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,860
Is this detention?

336
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
No way, you're top of the class.

337
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,730
We understand you had
a rocky summer vacation.

338
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,840
Unproductive one.

339
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,160
Wasn't easy.

340
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,190
For any of us.

341
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,430
But he's learned a lot.

342
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,720
Absolutely.

343
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,740
Yeah, listen, I went through
that whole drug thing myself.

344
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
I mean... not at your age.

345
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,430
Like you but... shit happens.

346
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,050
Right, it just ahh...

347
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,200
... happens a lot earlier
than it used to.

348
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,490
Benjie's done a lot of growing up.

349
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,170
Yes, he has.

350
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,700
Uh, on the last season of

351
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,840
'Prince Lords' I was making
300 000 a week.

352
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,240
I was 9 years old.

353
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,170
How psychotic is that?

354
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,170
Crazy money.

355
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,480
For anyone

356
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,030
But worth every penny.

357
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,030
You've got a tremendous
fanbase out there.

358
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,030
I just didn't have the skills.

359
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,490
That kind of income
would fuck up Mother Teresa.

360
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,290
She's already fucked up.

361
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,740
She's dead.
That's how fucked up she is.

362
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,620
We have a mandate.

363
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,620
Christina knows this and I,
I know you do too.

364
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,620
We have to protect the franchise.

365
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,270
Goo-goo-ga-joo.

366
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,970
Only kept things quiet last year.

367
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,300
Arnold, your people were terrific.

368
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,100
Nothing from the tabloids.

369
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,010
Yeah still...

370
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,024
You know, an adult recovery can be a career boost but
with a child it's something else.

371
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,356
I think we understand that, Chip.

372
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,010
Though, ah, it didn't hurt Drew.

373
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,730
Hm?

374
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,730
Guys...

375
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,730
We're on your side.

376
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,860
Please understand that.

377
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,340
I don't think we'd all be in this room
if didn't feel a certain level of trust.

378
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,920
Do we have a budget yet?

379
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,350
Ah, 58,
but that's strictly in house.

380
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,540
Yeah, we lost Elle but, eh,
she's not someone we were counting on.

381
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,720
We're closing with Emma Watson
for the young mom so uh...

382
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,720
That should be fun.

383
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,680
We need to know the
circumstances of Benjie's rehab.

384
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,360
Uh Benjie...

385
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Detox in a private home.

386
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
The ranch of my husbands partner.

387
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,270
Kick-ass mom you got there.

388
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,620
Um.

389
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,530
She knows how to hit
without leaving marks on the body.

390
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,860
Fuck.

391
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,050
I will never be humiliated like...

392
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,950
... like that again.

393
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,890
Never.

394
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,900
It's over, baby.

395
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,110
We have them.

396
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,430
Did Damien told I was too old?

397
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,290
Mm-mm.

398
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,060
The casting people.

399
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,060
Sarah Horowitz?

400
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,280
Havana, come on.

401
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,820
The part's just written younger.

402
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,990
Sarah Horowitz cast me
in my very first movie.

403
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,640
Mm.

404
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,860
Probably saw that
thing I did on TNT for money.

405
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,120
Yeah, well, don't do anything for money.

406
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,290
Yeah, well we all haven't
been as smart as you.

407
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,030
You gonna support me on this, Sterl?

408
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,700
Are you gonna support me with Damien?

409
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,490
Look, you know I will.

410
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,640
I think he's taking
a hard look Azita Wachtel.

411
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,050
Azita Wachtel?

412
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,930
Well, she's nominated
for an Oscar and she's Canadian.

413
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,860
Canada is co-funding.

414
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,960
Do you know that Azita Wachtel story is?
Do you know what she's known for?

415
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,880
She used to let producers stick
their cocks in her ass and pee.

416
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,780
Good to know.

417
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,990
Look, you have a relationship with Damien.

418
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,210
Yeah, I've 3 calls in to him
but he won't return.

419
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,880
You gave a great reading.

420
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,980
He tell you that?

421
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,040
He said you were very strong.

422
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,900
He did, he said that?

423
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,920
Yes.

424
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,780
Oh my God!

425
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,300
Oh, Sterl!
I have to get this part!

426
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,120
We'd be so great together!

427
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Why, I thought we already were?

428
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,310
Diandra?

429
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,450
Oh my God! She's old!

430
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,450
Hey, did you know she's like 23?

431
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,080
I heard that she's 16.

432
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,240
How do you know she's 23?

433
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,610
Her labia is pierced.

434
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,960
You gotto be 23 to
have your labia pierced?

435
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,030
Now she's got a
tramp stamp... okay, she's

436
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,630
menopausal!

437
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,810
Hey, nice girls, huh?

438
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,280
Oh my God. 
 Rhett did you tell him?

439
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,010
Oh, bet you won't believe this.

440
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,620
No, nah, no,
it's too fucking weird.

441
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,240
- I'm not going to this.
- Now I'm getting interested.

442
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,120
Okay, so there's this crazy girl, right?

443
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,130
She's posted like 6000 messages on my

444
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,820
Facebook fan page in like 2 months.

445
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,340
Sounds like marriage material.

446
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,760
You should just fuck her, right?

447
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,240
Or eat her on her period.

448
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,300
Come on, don't be vulgar.

449
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Yeah, Bri won't even do that to me.

450
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,390
Well he can't.

451
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,830
Because your menopausal!

452
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,320
- Oh!
- Shut up!

453
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,810
- Come on, we...

454
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,480
Would you guys chill,
come on.

455
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,170
Alright, so,
production company looks into it and

456
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,670
finds out a teenster's been selling this chick
my shit for like 3000 dollars.

457
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,680
Excuse me, your shit?

458
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Yeah, you heard it right girl, my shit.

459
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,940
He's got some expensive doody.

460
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,520
It's got rice in it from uh...

461
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,780
Noboo!

462
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,010
Like out of a honey wagon?

463
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,840
No, like...um... when the guy
comes in with the hose

464
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,090
.... empty...you know...

465
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,560
What is she doing with it?

466
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,780
Stock pilling... for that rainy day.

467
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,120
Okay, like, where did she get the money?

468
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,300
Slush fund.

469
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,940
Oh! Benjie you are so sick!

470
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,860
There are some days, I actually,
I ran specials when I had diarrhea.

471
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,430
- Summer clearance.
- Everything must go!

472
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,630
Oh my God!

473
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,140
Come...

474
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,990
Who is that?

475
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,300
Starla Gent, country singer.

476
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,320
- She won the voice?
- Nah, she's runner up.

477
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
God, she is a wild woman.

478
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,310
Uh, hell of an actress, as well.

479
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,380
Didn't I tell you?

480
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,600
Javitz cast her in the part you wanted.

481
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,710
Shut up!

482
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,600
Ah, I wonder if
Blake Sheldon pied in that butt.

483
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,020
Hey, you like Sam?

484
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,210
Um.

485
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,210
You could totally fuck her.

486
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,630
She wants to be in your movie.
I hear she gets great Oxy too.

487
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,330
I've almost got 90 days.

488
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:57,940
To what?

489
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Sobriety, you dick-wad!

490
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,290
Oh, my God!
The human stench.

491
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,450
Fat, anchor whore from TNT
was in the bathroom. We saw her ankles.

492
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,670
What was her name again?

493
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,670
It was like something Dead Farted.

494
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,020
Hey, isn't that Sterl Carruth?

495
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,540
Oh yeah, with Havana Segrand.

496
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,250
We have the same agent.

497
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,870
How old is she?

498
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,780
Totally menopausal.

499
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,970
Oh, beyond! She's near death!

500
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,500
She's like older than my grandmother.

501
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,910
Oh, she is. She MILF.
Grandmother I like to fuck.

502
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,690
Are they fucking?

503
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,510
Ah, she'd be like a mercy fuck.

504
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,090
Like when orderlies rape
old people in nursing homes.

505
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,100
Hey, didn't her mom die in a fire?

506
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,030
Yeah!

507
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,320
Like Jack Cassidy.

508
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Who's that?

509
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,690
The prodigal swinger.
David Cassidy's father.

510
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,700
Who's David Cassidy?

511
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,930
Sean Cassidy's brother.

512
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,880
You know her mom was
really cool actress as well, um...

513
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
... Clarice Taggart?

514
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,230
Yeah, um...

515
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,290
Annie did a thing on her.
She was really cool!

516
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,880
She was young.

517
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,720
Who is that?!

518
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,080
Fuck.

519
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,410
Fuck.

520
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,470
Hey, Damien, what's happening?

521
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, yeah, I could totally wear 2 earrings.

522
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,660
I love that.

523
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,520
Um, Maestro, I'm just, eh...

524
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,800
I'm just here with the kids.
Doing the whole bedtime story thing.

525
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,650
Can I... can I call you back?

526
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,280
Um, yeah, no, I'll, yeah,
I'll call you right back first thing.

527
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,320
Hey!

528
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,150
Mention me when... you talk!

529
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,150
You are so fucking crazed.

530
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,220
Suck my dick and I'll put in a word.

531
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,980
I loved you so much.

532
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,140
You were such
a beautiful little girl but you lied.

533
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,540
How could you grow up
to be a monster who lies?

534
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,610
Fuck.

535
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,200
Hey!

536
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,930
What's happening?

537
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,570
I'm sorry, it's...

538
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,300
I just got uncomfortable.

539
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,590
I guess I'm a lousy dyke.

540
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,360
Why don't you take a Klonopin?

541
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,350
I know a man...

542
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,850
... who lives under the sword of Damocles...

543
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,390
... we call aids.

544
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,640
'When my time comes', he told me...

545
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,470
I'll be ready.

546
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,710
My bags are packed

547
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,190
and at the door.

548
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,560
I like that.

549
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,840
I like that very much.

550
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,990
There is a time in
our lives and in out therapies

551
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,990
when out eyes stray

552
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,990
to the bags at the door.

553
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,300
After we wept.

554
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,280
After we have suffered.
After we have exhausted the fountain of memory.

555
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,040
Bloodied our hands.

556
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
In the walls of our parents house.

557
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,480
I thought that
Gary Marshall was gonna be there.

558
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,950
And it was a meet.
I didn't know I was gonna have to read.

559
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,940
And then they gave me
the wrong drive-on and I had to walk like a mile.

560
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,710
And I stank by the time I got there.

561
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,780
And then the casting director, who I know

562
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,960
doesn't even acknowledge me.

563
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,840
She just walks right by
without saying a word and...

564
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,860
... and then she tells me...

565
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,820
She doesn't even know if
Gary even knows I'm coming in.

566
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,270
You know this is Gary Marshall,
not Berdalucci.

567
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,720
His movies don't make
money any more and I know Gary.

568
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,110
And then she says they
want to put me on tape

569
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,610
and I'm like, excuse me but
you need special make-up for that

570
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,840
or you look green and she says

571
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,240
well you can either tape or not!

572
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,250
Like it's all some pointless exercise and
I just can't take it anymore, Jacob!

573
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,190
I'm so tired and it's so pathetic!

574
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,200
Is that Carrie?

575
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,730
Later Jacob. They're here.

576
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,510
Hi Carrie!

577
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,270
How are you?

578
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:29,230
Oh, when I get in touch with
myself I'll let you know.

579
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,670
It's been insane.

580
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,700
Did you rap?

581
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,890
Well, we go back to Prague
tomorrow to do re-shoots.

582
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,300
Are you doing the Javitz film?

583
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,380
Oh, I hope so.
Did you hear something?

584
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,800
Well, Genie told me you were up for it.

585
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,780
That would be so amazing
for you to play your own mother.

586
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,450
I mean...

587
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,970
Every daughter should have
that opportunity, right?

588
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,440
Do you know Damien?

589
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,260
Well, we just...
had dinner once in Tangeers.

590
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,620
Well, if you see him,
tell him to hire me.

591
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,820
Oh, Genie told me about Adaggio.

592
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,270
Eh, how long did she work for you?

593
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,480
3 years.

594
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,710
Are you still looking for a new assistant?

595
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,930
Absolutely, you've become
my employment agency.

596
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,400
Would you do me a big favor?

597
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
This is gonna sound bizarre but...

598
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,850
Would you interview this girl
that I met on the Internet?

599
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm so nervous.

600
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Naw, it's okay.

601
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,420
Do you like some tea?

602
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
Oh, thank you, yes.

603
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,620
Your house is so beautiful.

604
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,290
Walls are so thick and those chimes.

605
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,630
Oh, their from a monastery
in Dharamsala.

606
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,680
I met the Dalai Lama.

607
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,290
He's very cool man.

608
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,140
He laughs a lot and he's...

609
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,280
actually just like someone you
wanna hang with, you know?

610
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,970
But, you can't cause
he's the Dalai Lama!

611
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,250
Thank you for the tea.

612
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,730
Marie is at the hospital.

613
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,960
My housekeeper.

614
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,750
One of her girls is sick.
She's got like, you know, 40 kids.

615
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,880
So...

616
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,750
I guess you know why you're here.

617
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,750
Mm, because of Carrie.

618
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,540
How did you guys start e-mailing?

619
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,600
Well, she wrote on Twitter that she was

620
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
researching for a
new novel she was writing.

621
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
About a burn girl so...

622
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,080
I wrote to her and then I met her
at a Star Wars convention in Florida.

623
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,330
Was that weird for you, I mean...

624
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,400
She's so amazing.
You know, she's such a funny, amazing person.

625
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,840
Plus we both have dual disorders,
we finish each others sentences.

626
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
So you came out here to see her?

627
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,920
I just wanted to see Hollywood.

628
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,720
But she said she'd take me to
breakfast at the 4 Seasons.

629
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,970
Zooey Deschanel was there.

630
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,640
And Sally Draper,
the little girl from Mad Men.

631
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,030
It was pretty amazing.

632
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,240
Do you have family?

633
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,380
In Florida, that's where I'm from.

634
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,100
Agatha, um...

635
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,910
Can I ask about the burn?

636
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,870
Ah...

637
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,560
I was working in
a planetarium after school...

638
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,570
I was 12.

639
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,860
There was an electrical fire and
I ran into a store room.

640
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,860
Like a jerk...

641
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,280
Mm.... um... well...

642
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,860
This isn't a very glamorous job.

643
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,150
I'm not used to glamor.

644
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,710
Mm, you'd be like

645
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:26,000
mostly running errands, going shopping
and getting things fixed and...

646
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,700
Ms. Segrand, I would be
the most loyal, most competent,

647
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,660
most grateful personal assistant
you've ever had.

648
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,770
You don't have a car?

649
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,150
But you drive?

650
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,660
I have a valid Florida license.

651
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,960
Mm, we can rent you a car.

652
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,490
I think maybe...

653
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,550
Mustang, or something.

654
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,750
Carrie's so funny.

655
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,790
She knew I should meet you.

656
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,020
Do you know how my mother died?

657
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,940
No.

658
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,100
In a fire.

659
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,220
Oh.

660
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,730
Agatha.

661
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,280
I think you're beautiful.

662
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,270
And do you know
who looks just like you?

663
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,350
Inside?

664
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,370
Havana Segrand.

665
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,340
We got a request.

666
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,250
What is it?

667
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,570
Hollywood tour. Cash call.
Holly Prest Hotel.

668
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,420
On my school notebook.

669
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,420
On my desk and on the trees.

670
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,420
On the sand and in the snow,
I write your name.

671
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,510
On all the flesh that says yes.

672
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,790
On the forehead of my friends,
on every hand held out, I write your name.

673
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,190
Liberty.

674
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,170
So you were in a fire, right?

675
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,630
You know, I never really
figured out what happened.

676
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,110
I think, one night I got drunk and
slept really hard on my face.

677
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,970
So, now you hit Tinseltown,
what are you gonna do?

678
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,270
Can't ah...

679
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,420
... keep riding around in limos
if you want to keep your money.

680
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,950
Actually, I got a job.

681
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,070
Oh yeah, where?

682
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,660
Do you know Havana Segrand?

683
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,410
Sure. Know of.

684
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,360
I'm her new personal assistant.

685
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,230
That's the...

686
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,880
Carrie Fisher connection?

687
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,360
Actually it was.

688
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,890
Havana is getting me a car.

689
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,230
Hey, do you wanna have
dinner on the weekend?

690
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,860
Um...

691
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,050
Yeah, this weekend is
not good for me I have to ah...

692
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,980
... I have to work on my script.

693
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
I have a great idea for a movie.

694
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,660
Maybe we could write it together?

695
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,650
It's got an incest theme I guess
those are kinda of overdone, huh?

696
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,600
Sex abusing your religion.

697
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,830
The truth is my parents
are brother and sister.

698
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,000
I never tell anyone that.

699
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,200
But I think it would be corny.
It's like, been there, done that.

700
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,870
I know that sounds jaded but
I think it would make a cool indie.

701
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,270
You know, I want to act in it.
And you could too.

702
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,230
Mm...

703
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,400
Think it would be good
if it wasn't pretentious

704
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,470
you know if we got the whole
mythological thing going on.

705
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,020
Uh, look Agatha...

706
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,160
Think you're a little crazy.

707
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,250
Well, so...

708
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,040
I mean...

709
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,920
What I'm saying is um...

710
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,420
I'm kind of,
kind of involved with someone.

711
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,370
And uh...

712
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,360
I mean...

713
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,340
Hope everything works out for you.

714
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,950
Look I don't want to take your money.

715
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,300
Fuck you.

716
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,990
It was...

717
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,560
... like a dream but
it seemed so fucking real.

718
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Go on.

719
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,930
A girl... I ah...

720
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,680
Met her at the hospital.

721
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,240
We sent her an iPad but
they said she died.

722
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,080
Then...

723
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,360
... she came into
my room at the house.

724
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,640
Scared the shit out of me.

725
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,300
Maybe it was a dream.

726
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,580
Am I going crazy?

727
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,170
No.

728
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,350
Well, I...

729
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,840
Think it's probably time for you to
start talking about certain things.

730
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,530
My sister?

731
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,530
Yes.

732
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,650
She always, ah...

733
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,660
... wanted to...

734
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,840
... marry me.

735
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,850
That's how we played.

736
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,070
We did the ceremony.

737
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,290
Isn't that strange?

738
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,390
Think I'm crazy like her?

739
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,060
No.

740
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,430
But...

741
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,360
... if we don't look at things
they can make us crazy.

742
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,620
Mom and dad were...

743
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,130
... at some party...

744
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,100
I was 6 or 7 then.

745
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,140
That night...

746
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,460
... the night it happened...

747
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,000
... we uh...

748
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,230
... had the ceremony, the marriage thing.

749
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,380
And uh...

750
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,240
... she gave me pills...

751
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,060
... vitamins she said...

752
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,180
... and uh, I woke up in the hospital,
they pumped my stomach and...

753
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,170
... the firemen...

754
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,760
... carried me out there...

755
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,270
... and I never saw her again.

756
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,170
- Maybe you asked your parents if they had...
- I did.

757
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,730
They don't talk about her.

758
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,100
They won't.

759
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,100
The girl at the hospital...

760
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,110
Harriet...

761
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,550
... what do I do?

762
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,130
What do I do if she comes back?

763
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,040
You call me.

764
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,440
I'm afraid.

765
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,510
Whenever I see her, it's so...

766
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,690
... real.

767
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,750
I don't want to be hospitalized.

768
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,100
My career is so fucked as it is.

769
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,020
Textbook TSS Havana.

770
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
You saw heavy combat as a child.

771
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,470
Could I be a multiple?

772
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,470
I don't see that but if you are,
we'll deal with it.

773
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,680
Damn her!

774
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,490
What does she want?

775
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,820
When you came out of hiding and
externalized your shame...

776
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,400
... mother didn't like that.

777
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,700
But what we can name,
we can tame.

778
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,420
She wants me to fail.

779
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,420
- But I won't.
- I won't.

780
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,420
That's

781
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,490
little Havana.

782
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,400
Celebrate her.

783
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,660
The Imago Deity,
that's what Jung called it.

784
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
We call it...

785
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,340
... the magical child.

786
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,450
And that child, will not fail.

787
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,360
Lay down.

788
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,170
I hired a girl.

789
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,790
It's amazing.

790
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,300
Why is it amazing?

791
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,710
She's disfigured.

792
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,280
She was...

793
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,300
... burned in a fire.

794
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,020
On her face...

795
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,540
Where is she from?

796
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,030
Florida.

797
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,920
It's amazing. She just...

798
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,980
... showed up on my doorstep.

799
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,900
I get this sense that I'm...

800
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,670
... working through something
by hiring her.

801
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,620
People don't just enter
our lives randomly, we call them.

802
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,700
Two women linked by fire.

803
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,030
I bet those visions go away.

804
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,960
Oh... God!

805
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,190
Do you think so?

806
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,000
You're welcoming
mom into the house.

807
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,820
You're saying 'Hey, mom'.

808
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,100
'Come on in'.

809
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,780
'You don't scare me.'

810
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,570
'I'm empowered.'

811
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,960
'Soup's on'.

812
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,430
'This is my house, ma'.

813
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,920
'I build it with my pain and my hope'.

814
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,860
'And you can't hurt me anymore'.

815
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,300
'I'm a magical child, ma'.

816
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,860
'So, come on in'.

817
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,220
'Mi casa'

818
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,320
'Es su casa'.

819
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,460
Deep breath now, Havana.

820
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,110
Breathe.

821
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,860
What if she comes to the house?

822
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,700
She won't.

823
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,880
Then what is she doing here?

824
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,740
Maybe she is sightseeing.

825
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,100
Why are you so cavalier about this?

826
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,000
We've always handled
things differently you and I.

827
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,020
You got to get her fired.

828
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,680
And then what?

829
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,180
She's working for Havana.
We know where she is.

830
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,460
And that buys us time.

831
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,710
What if she tries to get to Benjie?!

832
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,040
I'm concerned about the tabloids.

833
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,980
I'm about to go on a
book tour, for Christ sakes!

834
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,930
In my school books.

835
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,080
On my desk.

836
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,160
In the trees.

837
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,500
On the sand, in the snow.

838
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,000
<i>I write your name. </i>

839
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,870
<i>On all the flesh that says yes.</i>

840
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,330
<i>On the forehead of my friends. </i>

841
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,820
<i>Son?</i>

842
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,260
One second!

843
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,360
Come in.

844
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,810
Saw your light.

845
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,680
I couldn't sleep.

846
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,020
Me neither.

847
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,670
Were you reading?

848
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,960
Just building up on the script.

849
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,400
That's hard to do without a partner.

850
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,150
Mom usually reads for me but um...

851
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,990
... I like to know lines pretty well
before we go over them.

852
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,160
That's what makes you pro.

853
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,050
Listen there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

854
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,220
I'm not taking anything.

855
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,270
Not even Seroquel.

856
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,870
I've got a really good sponsor.
He's been clean and sober for 20 years.

857
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,240
He's worked with Robert Downey Jr.

858
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,130
- Demi Levato.
- No.

859
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,310
It's about your sister.

860
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,960
We think she may be back.

861
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,070
Here in Los Angeles.

862
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,120
Did... did she call?

863
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,920
She hasn't yet.

864
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,410
Thought she was in prison somewhere.

865
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,310
Hospital.

866
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,710
Far away.

867
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,120
But... now she's...

868
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,940
Free, wild and 18.
Courts couldn't hold her.

869
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,610
We're in the process of acquiring
a restraining order against her.

870
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,320
- And I like you to tell me if she...
- A restraining order?

871
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,520
Too bad you couldn't have gotten
one when she was born.

872
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,740
You could've had a judge
standing by in the delivery room.

873
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,920
Maybe you tried that.

874
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,010
We tried a lot of things, Benjie.

875
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,360
Mostly we tried our best.

876
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,510
That's in your book.

877
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,480
That's a big thing in your book.

878
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,610
Trying your best.

879
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,750
It's supposed to give people major points.

880
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,530
I don't know that girl anymore so...

881
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,200
Not that I ever did.

882
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,450
<i>I don't know if she is dangerous.</i>

883
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,990
<i>I knew this day was coming.</i>

884
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,510
I thought somehow she'd just stay put.

885
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,470
That was stupid... of me.

886
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,500
But I want you to tell me...

887
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,990
... if she tries to see you.

888
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,900
I'll tell you if she pops up.

889
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,100
You know, me and you,
like to share.

890
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,430
Get some sleep son.

891
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,400
By the power of the word...

892
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,280
... I renew my life.

893
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,580
I was born to know you.

894
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,560
And to name you.

895
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,600
Liberty.

896
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,250
<i>Havana, sweetheart, I've...</i>

897
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,820
<i>I don't know if you've
read the trades, but um...</i>

898
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,780
<i>They unannounced that
Damien went with Azita.</i>

899
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,680
<i>I mean I can't say it's a
complete surprise but uh...</i>

900
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,180
<i>I'm very angry at the way it was handled.</i>

901
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,040
<i>I mean it...it... it just makes me
look foolish.</i>

902
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,600
<i>But that's my problem not yours.</i>

903
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,630
<i>I'm so sorry, honey!</i>

904
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,400
<i>I have calls into Damien.</i>

905
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,100
<i>And I hate to be leaving
this on your phone, I...</i>

906
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,000
<i>I... I just didn't want you to
hear it from someone else.</i>

907
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,810
<i>As you know I mean I strongly think
there's no love lost on this project.</i>

908
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,210
<i>Those were always my feelings.</i>

909
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,120
<i>I know and I respect the reasons
why it was so important to you, but I...</i>

910
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,220
<i>I think it's of equal importance
we put this behind us.</i>

911
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,430
<i>So... onward.</i>

912
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,000
<i>I'm messengering 6 scripts</i>

913
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,870
<i>to the house now!
Lots of great stuff on the horizon.</i>

914
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,360
<i>Call me as soon as you get this!</i>

915
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,020
<i>I love you!</i>

916
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,300
<i>And it's gonna be a great year!</i>

917
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,900
Made a hole in the wall.

918
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,480
So we'll be able to see everything.

919
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,780
- Everything?
- Or your money back.

920
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,920
Oh boy! I want to see her va-bina!

921
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,100
And... CUT!

922
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,230
Mr. Va-bina's getting all the laughs.

923
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,570
He's only in 4 scenes.

924
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,570
Yeah and he's stealing every one of them.

925
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,940
Piece of shit.

926
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,940
Would you call Genie?

927
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,500
Call Genie and tell her I want
the little piece of shit flushed.

928
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,940
And... what are you doing here?

929
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,450
I...

930
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,330
I wanted to talk to you about something but,
you know, it could wait.

931
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,190
Not the studio's drug paranoia again?

932
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,850
No, not the studio and their drug paranoia.

933
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,740
<i>Ready for you Benjie!</i>

934
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,500
Fuck off!

935
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,200
I need something to eat.

936
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,280
My blood sugar drops every time I do
a scene with Mr. Piece of Shit Va-bina.

937
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,210
Oh... ma, can you put one of those
breakfast burritos in the microwave.

938
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,780
2 minutes is perfect.

939
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,320
Hey.

940
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,510
How you doing?

941
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,800
I'm cool.

942
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,630
Thought you'd be working on your script.

943
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,600
I wish I was.

944
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,660
Got to pay the bills.

945
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,630
How's your business?

946
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,920
It's alright.

947
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,180
Got a callback from 'Blue Matrix'.

948
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,170
You watch it?

949
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,760
Not into space soaps.

950
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,540
Well...

951
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,950
... it's got a kind of...

952
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,950
... 'Battlestar Galactica' thing going on.

953
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,530
Post 9/11.

954
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,310
Can't believe I just spent 18 000 dollars.

955
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,590
- Let's go.
- Havana this is Jerome.

956
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,460
Hi.

957
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,330
He's a chauffeur.

958
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,820
Wonderful.

959
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,120
Jerome just got an audition
for 'Battlestar Galactica'.

960
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,240
It's actually... ah...  'Blue Matrix'.

961
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,680
I'm a big fan.

962
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,360
Aww... thank you.

963
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,470
Well um... good luck.

964
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,600
Havana!

965
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,950
Oh my God!

966
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,950
Azita!

967
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,840
Thanks.

968
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,390
Oh...

969
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,250
Mm... uh... Sydney just
told me you were here.

970
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,380
- Uh... I was in the dressing room.
- I was gonna call you.

971
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,630
Congratulations.

972
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,660
Thank you, thank you.
I'm so excited.

973
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,800
You are gonna be so great.

974
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,640
- You think?
- And you're gonna love working with Damien.

975
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,040
Yeah, he's so great.
Um...

976
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,280
Havana!

977
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,330
That makes me feel so good.

978
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:34,000
Your mother was so special.
It's gonna be a challenge for me.

979
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,040
Uh, I don't want to do impersonations.

980
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,040
Do you know who's gonna
play my mother when she was young?

981
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,060
Anne...

982
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,620
... Hathaway.

983
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,580
How's that gonna work?

984
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,600
Oh, oh, you'd love Anne.

985
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,110
Do you know her?
She... she's amazing.

986
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,430
Aww... just... just make it your own.

987
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,710
You know, for a heartbeat...

988
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,620
I really wanted to do it.
Isn't that insane?

989
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,760
Well, you should have!

990
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,120
But then I was like,
work it out in therapy, bitch!

991
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,780
Aww...

992
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,970
So adorable!

993
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,160
What's your name?

994
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,300
Uh, this is Micah.

995
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,580
Say hi to Havana.

996
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,850
Hi Micah.
You are so sweet!

997
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,970
My shy guy.

998
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:18,840
- Oh... what a heart breaker.
- Yeah.

999
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,710
Yeah...

1000
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,940
Well, great to see you.

1001
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,670
Yeah, you too.

1002
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,860
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

1003
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,450
Um, back in 10.

1004
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,440
Okay... go sweetie.

1005
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,760
Thank you, Luma.

1006
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,190
Can you let yourself out?

1007
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,440
I like your new chore whore.

1008
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,120
Awful phrase isn't it?

1009
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,920
You two have a lot in common.

1010
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,340
Like terrible men for one.

1011
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,540
Hey ma...

1012
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,050
I'm empowered.

1013
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,020
Soups on.

1014
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,660
I'm a magical child, ma,
so come on in.

1015
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,620
Mi casa es su casa.

1016
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,420
What do you want?

1017
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,720
This bravado of mine.

1018
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,210
It's asinine and I'm sorry.

1019
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,720
It's just...

1020
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,150
... I'm nervous around you.

1021
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,590
It's sounds comical but
I'm not used to being around people.

1022
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,280
I'm not gonna listen to this.

1023
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,740
Those incidents you keep
sharing on the talk shows...

1024
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,810
... they're falls memories.

1025
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:56,860
Liar!

1026
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,510
From day one, liar!

1027
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,860
Your stepfather must have done
those things to you.

1028
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,530
Why couldn't I see it?

1029
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,840
His first wife warned me
that he was like that.

1030
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:12,020
You must have been so angry
at me for not protecting you.

1031
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:15,110
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away.

1032
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,960
You blame yourself for
the night I burned, don't you?

1033
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,120
This is my house, ma.

1034
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,020
I built it.

1035
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,910
My pain and my hell.

1036
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,380
And you can't hurt me anymore.

1037
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,700
I'm sorry.

1038
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,380
I just got uncomfortable.

1039
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,540
I guess I'm a lousy dyke.

1040
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,540
Hi.

1041
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,270
Are you okay?

1042
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,360
I have the flu.

1043
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,240
I need cigarettes.

1044
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,530
American Spirit and...

1045
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,780
I need you to pick up some prescriptions.

1046
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,850
Avian. Vicodin. Xanex. Zoloft.

1047
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,800
And Astragalus and Goldenseal.

1048
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,120
And um...

1049
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,140
Yogi-tea.

1050
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,520
Agatha.

1051
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,480
Do you know Stafford Weiss?

1052
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,470
The therapist?

1053
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:35,980
No.

1054
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,560
No... course you don't.

1055
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,970
Why should you?
I'm getting information from a fucking dead person.

1056
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:45,120
Tampax.... I need Tampax and um...

1057
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:46,190
And...

1058
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,970
Kozy Shack?
You know what Kozy Shack is?

1059
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,640
Comes in these big tubs, like...

1060
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,120
Tapioca.... rice pudding...

1061
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,560
And truffles from Masion du Chocolat.

1062
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,780
You can... you can got those at, um....

1063
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,240
... at Neimens.

1064
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,190
And um... come out to the yard.

1065
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,220
Um uh... I need...
I need to move some plants.

1066
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,550
They've been like this since the fucking earthquake.

1067
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,900
And I just...
I want to move them over there.

1068
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,390
Don't worry about the tiles

1069
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,860
cause they are gonna be redone
so you could just drag them.

1070
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,410
They look so heavy.

1071
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,070
Don't make me into a
mommy dearest, okay?

1072
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,820
You're strong, you can do it.
You're already wearing gloves, just...

1073
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:30,640
Just put you're weight into it.

1074
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,050
No, swivel it.
Like this look here.

1075
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:35,740
Swivel.

1076
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,200
<i>Hello?!</i>

1077
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,790
The door was open!

1078
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:52,670
What's happening?

1079
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,650
This hasn't hit the news yet.

1080
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,390
What?

1081
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,140
Azita Wachtel's little boy...

1082
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,290
... died.

1083
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,740
No!
I just saw them!

1084
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,170
Um... he was with his dad, in Ohi.

1085
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,520
- And he drowned.
- My God!

1086
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,700
Micah! How?!

1087
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,940
In the pool...
- And she wasn't there?

1088
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,140
I don't know, I mean, nobody knows yet.

1089
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:14,240
Anything.

1090
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,640
But here's what's going on.

1091
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,300
And I know it's schoolish...

1092
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,330
But I think we can get you to replace...

1093
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,620
But how?

1094
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,144
Well Azita is in the hospital.
You know.

1095
00:55:24,144 --> 00:55:26,140
She totally lost it.
They had to sedate her.

1096
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,890
Um... won't they just shoot
around her for a few weeks?

1097
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,600
There's no way she's going back to work.

1098
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:30,610
How much have they shoot?
There's no way she's going back to work.

1099
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:31,910
How much have they shoot?

1100
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,480
Eh, just a few days.

1101
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,300
Casting people called me.

1102
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,380
3 times.

1103
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,040
Sarah Horowitz? She call back?

1104
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,250
Yeah... they want to make an offer.

1105
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:43,590
Did Damien call?

1106
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,900
No, but you know,
he's probably consumed.

1107
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,360
Well,  but, Havana...

1108
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:50,830
They are not gonna make an offer
without Damien's complete approval.

1109
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,860
No. Ah... Azita should just... do it.

1110
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,100
She should... she should work.

1111
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,460
She should go to the funeral and
then go right back to work.

1112
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,730
Yeah I know, it's beyond but
do you still want to do it?

1113
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,300
I need to talk to Damien.

1114
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,430
You will!

1115
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,760
But this just happened.

1116
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,880
I haven't been able to reach anyone.

1117
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,630
Don't go deafen my quote ,
cause if they're really in trouble, we're in the capital seat.

1118
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,240
Unless they're out to somebody else.

1119
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,330
I'll call you as soon as I hear.

1120
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,370
Should I send flowers?!

1121
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,140
You're not supposed to know!

1122
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,680
And save the flowers to Damien,
when we close!

1123
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,940
Ciao!

1124
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,960
Na-na-naa-na!

1125
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,780
Na-na-na-naa!

1126
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,820
Hey-hey-hey!

1127
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,620
Goodbye! Come on sing it!

1128
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,510
Na-na-naa-na!

1129
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,510
Na-na-na-naa!

1130
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,330
Hey-hey-hey!

1131
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,900
Goodbye! This is for little Micah!

1132
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,350
- Little miracles!
- Who's Micah?

1133
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,840
Fire and water!

1134
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,360
We're fire and he's water!

1135
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,360
- So say goodbye!
- Bye!

1136
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,690
Na-naa-na-goodbye Micah!
Na-na-na-naa!

1137
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,960
-Fire and water, say it!
- Fire and water!

1138
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,480
Hey-hey-hey, goodbye, woohaa!

1139
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,720
Excuse me?

1140
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:23,000
I'm looking for Jerome Fontana.
He had a callback?

1141
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,220
He's a Vorbalit?

1142
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,420
Try make-up.

1143
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,170
Hey!

1144
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,770
What are you doing here?

1145
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,380
Havana is having lunch at the commissary.
Thought I'd see if I can find you.

1146
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,040
Is it supposed to be a burn?

1147
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,720
No, I don't think so. I think uh...

1148
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,760
... it's a birthmark or something.

1149
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,620
We're half an hour away.

1150
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,960
Go back to make-up and
get some color on that thing.

1151
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,780
They did have a cover... for the pool but...

1152
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,590
The motor was in the shop for repair.

1153
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,130
He didn't swim?

1154
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,030
The father heard the phone...

1155
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,880
And he thought it was Azita
so he went inside for like

1156
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,820
That's always how it happens,
I mean, uff, thats...

1157
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,240
Always how you hear it happens.

1158
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,540
Mm.

1159
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,140
Have you talked to Azita?

1160
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,400
Uh, yeah, I went to see her.
She's home now.

1161
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,960
I told her you were playing her part.

1162
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,080
She was relieved. 

1163
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,910
At least she seemed to be.

1164
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,000
I felt weird.

1165
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,420
Going in there to tell her...

1166
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,680
... that. But we had become close.

1167
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,280
Anyway, listen, I... I was...

1168
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,700
I was going to call you.

1169
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,060
To tell you about my decision to go...

1170
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,960
... with Azita but things went crazy.

1171
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,300
Yeah, it's cool Damien.
I'm... I'm totally fine.

1172
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,690
Yeah... I'm not.

1173
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,580
I don't like the way...

1174
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,780
... that that was handled.

1175
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,590
I loved your read.

1176
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:17,940
You know that.

1177
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,970
I had some initial misgivings about...

1178
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,570
... the connection to your mother.

1179
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,880
But...

1180
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,220
... the film, that I'm making...

1181
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,560
... is very different from the original.

1182
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,220
In fact, in some ways
it does not resemble it at all.

1183
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,950
Which I would probably be
taking it to task for it.

1184
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,800
The script is amazing.

1185
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,020
Thank you.

1186
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,960
You know, I just want you to feel strong.

1187
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,360
Coming in like this.

1188
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,740
Things happen for a reason.

1189
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,010
I'm a big believer in that.

1190
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,940
So glad to have you on this show.

1191
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,380
Benjie?

1192
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,640
Hey, Victoria Lap in Star! Channel,
are you ready for us now?

1193
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,740
- No.
- Uh, we had a 4 o'clock interview with you.

1194
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,920
- No.
- Didn't Genie tell you?

1195
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,490
- No.
- Uh, uh, well can we just have 15 minutes?

1196
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,240
No.

1197
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,150
Okay, we've been waiting here for you.

1198
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,960
Why don't you talk
to my co-star Jim Carrey Jr.?

1199
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,710
There he is.

1200
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,890
Hey! Mr. Piece of Shit Va-bina!
Wanna be on TV?

1201
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:38,800
Sure.

1202
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,130
Get your jailbait ass over here.

1203
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,450
Hi, I'm Roy.

1204
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,250
Hey Benjie.

1205
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,340
FUCK!
You! Get out!

1206
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,090
Hey, it's okay.
I'm here to make amends.

1207
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,650
How did you get on the lot?

1208
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,720
I work for somebody
who's doing a film here.

1209
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,020
Havana Segrand.

1210
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,480
You're gonna hurt me, Agatha?

1211
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:31,960
No...

1212
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,080
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1213
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,460
You're my little brother.

1214
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,670
You try to hurt me and
I'll fucking kill you!

1215
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,890
- Understood?
- Um-hm.

1216
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:46,830
You hungry?

1217
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,340
Want a breakfast burrito?

1218
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,240
No, I can't stay long.

1219
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,460
Havana Segrand, huh?

1220
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:58,400
- Was that bullshit or are you serious?
- Um-hm.

1221
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,250
She's really good.

1222
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,530
We have the same agent.

1223
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,510
How that happen,
you working for Havana Segrand?

1224
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,760
Oh... it's...  through friends.

1225
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,320
Carrie Fisher.

1226
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,270
You know for a...  a disfigured schizophrenic
you got the town pretty wired.

1227
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,360
They now you are here, Agatha.

1228
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,680
How?

1229
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,210
Dad! He's all fucking seeing and knowing
if you don't remember.

1230
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,300
Watch your step cause...

1231
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,400
... the old man is getting a restraining order
against you or some such shit.

1232
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,800
I prefer if you didn't tell them I stopped by.

1233
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,700
I'm not a big fan of closures so...

1234
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:49,540
If you're looking for an epiphany
that's gonna help you go on with your life than...

1235
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,770
I wrote to you...

1236
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,630
... for years.

1237
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,180
To explain.

1238
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,560
Benjie, it's Jeb Berg.

1239
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,630
I'm taking a nap Jeb.

1240
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,850
There he is, hey, that's alright, listen...

1241
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,250
I've got my nieces here from
Connecticut and they...

1242
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,620
Universal Studios.

1243
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:16,460
Put there asses on the tram Jeb Berg.

1244
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,250
You're so mean.

1245
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,460
I fuck them when I can.
Do you want a Cobalt?

1246
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:28,120
Nah, sugar makes me crazy.

1247
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,800
Very funny.

1248
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,980
So, uh, mom and dad...

1249
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,980
... sent you to the snake pit?

1250
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,500
The courts did.

1251
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,910
Looking pretty good.

1252
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,010
I was in Sherman Oaks. On the burn ward.

1253
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,110
After my grapht they sent me to Florida.

1254
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,520
The Land of Scarface. 

1255
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:51,140
Tony Montana, I love it.

1256
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,100
Did you put that in?

1257
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:59,510
Um-hm.

1258
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,440
That's Havana's mom.

1259
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,270
Did you start the fire?

1260
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,260
This is hard.

1261
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,600
No shit. Did you?

1262
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,880
But I didn't want anything to happen to you.

1263
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,100
Do you know about them?

1264
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,180
About who we are.
Did they tell you?

1265
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,660
Pills?

1266
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,070
- Vitamins?
- Probably something for sleep.

1267
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,910
So you gave me pills and then
you set the house on fire?

1268
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,520
Why am I having trouble with the
'I didn't want anything to happen with you' part?

1269
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,990
- I was seeing things!
- Like what?

1270
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,100
Children.

1271
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,810
What'd you do when you uh...

1272
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:46,860
... when you saw them?

1273
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,240
I would say...

1274
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,340
... by this ring,
you are consecrated to me.

1275
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:57,530
I remember that's... that's...
that was the game we played.

1276
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,120
It always worked.

1277
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,860
As soon as I said it,
they always went away.

1278
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,460
Okay, uh, I think you have to go now.

1279
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,800
Benjie...

1280
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,010
There's this script.

1281
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,630
I can't explain but you are part of this
beautiful mythological script.

1282
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:21,340
Oh my God.

1283
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:25,900
My long lost psychotron sister
is pitching me a movie.

1284
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,480
Agatha, leave.

1285
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,780
And take the DVD with you.

1286
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,420
You don't have to worry
about me starting anymore fires.

1287
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,760
They blew my pile lighter right out.

1288
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,920
Work your program Milton.

1289
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,470
Don't argue in the bedroom. Bedroom...

1290
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:53,150
... is for sleeping, making love, not for fighting.

1291
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,150
You need to talk, go to a coffee shop.

1292
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:56,880
Thank you.

1293
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,050
- Thanks.
- See you Tuesday.

1294
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,050
Okay. Thanks.

1295
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:09,900
Yeah?

1296
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,690
Was she there now?

1297
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:34,740
Hello, Agatha.

1298
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,830
My books!

1299
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,560
You're reading any of them?

1300
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,100
Yes.

1301
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,830
Secrets kill.

1302
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:47,300
A classic.

1303
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,430
How did you find me?

1304
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,410
Please, no film noir questions.

1305
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:53,840
- Did Benjie...
- Did Benjie tell me you're here?

1306
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,290
How would he now that?
Did you go see Benjie?

1307
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,090
- No...
- Bad idea. Going to see Benjie.

1308
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,120
Reckless.

1309
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,660
A question remains.

1310
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,380
Why are you in LA?

1311
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:11,300
I'm in recovery.

1312
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:14,120
I wanted to make amends.

1313
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,710
No one escapes
the long arm of 12-step.

1314
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,640
Why didn't you ever come and see me?

1315
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,730
That's a victim question.

1316
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:30,950
That's, and I never promised you
a Rose card question.

1317
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:32,980
<i>You know why.</i>

1318
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:36,390
I don't believe in rewarding.
Homicidal behavior.

1319
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:38,110
I've changed.

1320
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:43,300
I wanted to tell you how...
how sorry I am for what I did.

1321
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,590
I wanted to tell you and mother.
I sent letters.

1322
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,370
Apology's accepted.

1323
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,680
You need money?

1324
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:53,920
No, I have a job.

1325
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,160
I'm working for Havana Segrand.

1326
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,750
She asked if I knew you.

1327
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,200
Here.

1328
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,930
Here's 10 000 dollars.
I want you to get on a plane, that would be true amends.

1329
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:07,350
Our lives are rich and full.
We made them from the ashes of what you left.

1330
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:10,110
Give Ms. Segrand a notice.

1331
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,110
Father...

1332
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:15,870
Please.

1333
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,240
Don't ever think about seeing
Benjie again or Christina, do you understand?

1334
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:26,490
You can't have actually believed I would let you
come back and fuck up my world again?

1335
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,820
Take your skin cream...

1336
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:33,090
... and your meds and your
hefty bag luggage and send them out the door.

1337
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,320
And work your program.

1338
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,300
Alright.

1339
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,610
We're done Benjie.
I'll see you Friday.

1340
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:56,040
Alright, thanks Rusty.

1341
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,320
Hey!

1342
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,580
What are you doing in there?

1343
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,570
What the fuck are you doing in my pool?

1344
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,630
Who are you?

1345
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,350
Micah!

1346
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:27,400
It's a drowned boy.

1347
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,590
I don't want to see you.

1348
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,390
I didn't do anything to you.

1349
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,510
His father thinks you could
have done something to save him.

1350
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,080
That's what father's always think.

1351
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,890
I'm not doing this.

1352
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:45,410
Go play with somebody else.

1353
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:51,060
I'm alive, asshole! I'm alive!
And I'm not crazy!

1354
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,060
I know a man...

1355
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,760
... who lives under the sword of Damocles.

1356
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,260
We call aids.

1357
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,250
'When my time comes' he told me.

1358
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,210
I'll be ready.

1359
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,520
My bags are packed and at the door.

1360
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,750
I like that. I like that very m...

1361
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:42,870
Liberty.

1362
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,600
Say... we have to stop.

1363
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,130
We have to stop.

1364
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,700
You're a patient here.
I want to help you.

1365
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,150
You're a patient here.
I want to help you.

1366
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,820
You don't think I set those fires do you?

1367
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,430
Say, 'I think that you didn't mean to.
You just need help, that's all'.

1368
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:09,980
Think you didn't mean to.
You just need help, that's all.

1369
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:13,510
Don't you want to help me?

1370
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,760
Will you leave my stockings?

1371
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:21,320
I have burns.

1372
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,450
My legs. My stomach. My back.

1373
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:27,840
Okay.

1374
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,000
On my school notebook.

1375
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,990
On my desk and on the trees.

1376
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,720
In the sand and in the snow,
I write your name.

1377
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:44,200
On all the flesh that says yes.

1378
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,750
On the forehead of my friends.

1379
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,120
On every hand held out,
I write your name.

1380
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,770
<i>Your mother of course
was Clarice Taggart.</i>

1381
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,560
<i>The wonderful actress who died
tragically in a fire in the mid 70's.</i>

1382
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,560
<i>Christmas '76.</i>

1383
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,100
<i>You've spoken of your mother's addictions.</i>

1384
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,840
<i>And recently revealed and,
very bravely, I might say,</i>

1385
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,700
<i>that you yourself
were physically abused.</i>

1386
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,150
<i>And sexually, yes.</i>

1387
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:43,970
<i>Which is far more uncommon, usually it's a male,
the father, stepdad, what have you.</i>

1388
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:46,700
<i>And I wanna talk
about that Havana, but first...</i>

1389
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,230
<i>There is a question that
I've been dieing to ask.</i>

1390
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,260
<i>What is it like</i>

1391
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:56,080
<i>starring in a remake of a movie,
'Stolen Waters', as you are now</i>

1392
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:57,920
<i>and essentially</i>

1393
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,400
<i>playing your mother?</i>

1394
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,610
<i>Scary.</i>

1395
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:04,990
<i>I mean, we all hear that
we become our mothers but</i>

1396
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:06,880
<i>this is a bit extreme.</i>

1397
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,020
<i>And she was even nominated?</i>

1398
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,440
<i>For an academy award, yes,
which I believe she should have won.</i>

1399
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,350
<i>But she did get the Golden Globe.</i>

1400
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:17,840
<i>I suppose I feel about as
comfortable as I, as I could.</i>

1401
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,030
<i>- We're very lucky to have Damien Javitz directing...
- Agatha!</i>

1402
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,330
<i>- There is a man who's made some...
- Agatha, could you come up here?!</i>

1403
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:27,120
<i>strange films. Honored?
Yes, but strange nonetheless.</i>

1404
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,480
Don't be shy.

1405
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:34,620
I'm so backed up from the Vicodin.

1406
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:37,220
I need you to go back to
Whole Foods and get me a laxative.

1407
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:37,230
I think it's called 'Quiet Moment'.
I need you to go back to
Whole Foods and get me a laxative.

1408
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:38,900
I think it's called 'Quiet Moment'.

1409
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,360
Oh...

1410
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,810
I should call it 'Un-Quiet Moment'.

1411
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,160
Um, and I'm gonna need you tonight.

1412
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:49,190
Maria can't work. One of her 1000 kids
has got cholera or whatever.

1413
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:51,710
Oh, uh... what do... what do I do?

1414
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,440
Um, kitchen stuff. Mostly.

1415
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:57,960
You know, easy.
Refill drinks, maybe little serving.

1416
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:00,280
And have fun. Lots of interesting people.

1417
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,560
It'll be good for you.

1418
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,020
Fuck!

1419
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:07,120
I think I'm gonna need an enema.

1420
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,830
Oh! Wait , wait.

1421
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,860
I wanted to ask you something.

1422
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,060
Do you see men?

1423
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,820
Sometimes.

1424
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,730
Are you seeing someone now?

1425
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,240
You are!

1426
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:26,120
Just dating a little.

1427
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:27,860
What does he do?

1428
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,200
He's an actor.

1429
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:33,090
Oh God! They're the worst!
You have to fight them for the mirror in the mornings.

1430
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,250
Well in my case, that doesn't apply.

1431
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,970
He writes too.

1432
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:42,180
No. You know, you're very attractive.
Don't run yourself down.

1433
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,180
Do you do it with him?

1434
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:45,470
Havana!

1435
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:47,730
Eh, you can tell me!

1436
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,100
How much do you do?

1437
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,100
Almost everything.

1438
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:53,170
Do you come?

1439
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,060
There you go.

1440
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:57,780
Is he a waiter?

1441
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:02,100
No. He... you...uh, he drives a limousine.
You met him outside of Valentino's.

1442
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,680
Oh, yeah!

1443
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,070
He's cute.

1444
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:08,240
Man! Limo-drivers are Rolls!

1445
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:09,560
Um, okay.

1446
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:12,010
Um, I need

1447
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:15,440
yogurt and cigarettes and call the
hot tub man because the water's cold.

1448
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,850
My God. Oh my God! It stinks in here!

1449
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,620
Hey sucker fish!

1450
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,690
Hey! You're out late for a school night.

1451
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:33,370
2 days off.

1452
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,880
Have a Shirley Temple.

1453
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,360
Shirley you jest.

1454
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,250
Don't call me Shirley.

1455
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,040
Oh, um Benjie Weiss. Gretchen Voss.

1456
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:43,860
Hey, ah...

1457
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,250
I feel like getting in some shit tonight.
You got any?

1458
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,330
Mother still working you?

1459
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,530
Busting my expensive little hump,
one day at a time.

1460
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,840
Where's... ah... Kayla?

1461
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,670
Naw, fuck her.

1462
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:59,440
I did! After the teem-stress
sold her my poop.

1463
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,380
She got it for her song.

1464
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,680
Well, you mean for a Shlong.

1465
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,160
Oh, it's a long story.

1466
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,860
Long and coiled.

1467
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,420
What up with Sam?

1468
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,470
Well, let's find out.

1469
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,410
Shall we?

1470
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,980
She dug you, man.

1471
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,710
She dug you and you dissed her.

1472
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:19,290
I didn't dis her.

1473
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,930
Red, I know you're holding in.

1474
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,360
I'm not gonna be the one
to fuck up your sobriety, okay Benjie?

1475
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,550
Are you doing the
new babysitter sequel?

1476
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,020
Yeah.

1477
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:35,110
They made me an offer
my mother couldn't refuse.

1478
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,860
You made so much money.

1479
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:37,750
Yeah.

1480
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,340
Saw you in 'Thrill Kill'. Cool.

1481
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:43,130
We tried to have fun with horror.
The critics got it anyways.

1482
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,100
I uh...

1483
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,600
Got a little GHB, if you wanna get high?

1484
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,260
I think I love you.

1485
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:52,760
Alright, Sam's on a way, Jose.

1486
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:54,040
Done deal.

1487
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,910
The terminator.

1488
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,400
Cheers.

1489
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,610
Cheers.

1490
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:11,240
So, I got this off of eBay.
And supposedly, they used it at Columbine. Check it out.

1491
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,570
Hey! Hey! It's loaded man!
That's loaded.

1492
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:19,570
Then I'll empty it.

1493
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,780
Okay, don't fuck around.

1494
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:24,770
Benjie!

1495
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,710
That was so sick.

1496
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,710
Oh God. America only knew.

1497
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,070
Finish the joke, Rhett.

1498
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,170
About the hillbilly.

1499
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:35,170
Oh my God!
You've only been telling it for an hour.

1500
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:39,150
Okay, so, okay,
the hillbilly says to the yuppie...

1501
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:41,030
And what exactly is a yuppie?

1502
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,070
Are you serious?

1503
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:44,180
Oh, like, I know what it is.

1504
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,590
- I just don't know what it stands for.
- Okay.

1505
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:48,170
The hillbilly says to the yuppie, right?

1506
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:50,170
He says, 'I know a place where we can go'.

1507
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:50,900
Right?

1508
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,300
Well, they got dancing, they got farting

1509
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,040
they got drinking and
they got FUCKING, WOO!

1510
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,360
This is joking and safe sex?

1511
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:00,730
Fuck safe sex! Let's bareback!

1512
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:02,200
Alright, come on, give me that.

1513
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,500
Eh, I said... this is a joke.

1514
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,650
And it's safe sex.

1515
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,230
Oh, well... I hope not.

1516
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,400
I'm gonna have to kill you.

1517
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,352
Come on. Benjie!

1518
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,350
- This is getting old, alright?
- Yuppie says...

1519
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,060
... great!
Who else is gonna be there?

1520
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:18,720
And the hillbilly says...

1521
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,130
Who else?

1522
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,520
Just me...

1523
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,920
... and you.

1524
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:34,420
You mother fucker!
You idiot!

1525
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,420
Oh God!

1526
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,170
Holy shit!

1527
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:38,170
Oh fuck! FUCK!

1528
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,580
- Get out of here Benjie!
- Rhett, man, I'm sorry! You saw... I...

1529
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:43,560
I had all the bullets out.

1530
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,700
You're fucking crazy.
You killed my dog, asshole!

1531
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:53,430
You sick mother fucker! You killed my dog!
GET OUT OF HERE!

1532
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,960
May I come in?

1533
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:06,290
- I'm not sure that's a good idea.
- I won't stay long, mom.

1534
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:08,490
I just wanted to make amends.

1535
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:21,070
I've seen this house in the magazines.

1536
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,540
In ah...

1537
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,050
Architectural Digest and The Profiles of Father.

1538
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:32,540
Makes me feel exposed but...

1539
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,470
Stafford likes things personalized.

1540
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:41,840
Show the world how and where we live.

1541
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,980
Can I...

1542
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,420
... get you anything?

1543
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:54,440
Um, no thank you.

1544
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,780
I suppose it'll quit.

1545
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:10,520
Actually I thought
you'd come here sooner, it...

1546
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,440
It's been 7 years.

1547
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:16,940
Takes me that long to
put on my make-up.

1548
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,380
Agatha, I... I didn't go to see you.

1549
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:25,380
I wouldn't have come to
see me if I were you either.

1550
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,610
I was afraid.

1551
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:33,010
Cause of what you did.

1552
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:34,890
You don't have to explain.

1553
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,920
I've dreamt so much of that old house.

1554
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:41,450
It was the first place I visited
when I got back here.

1555
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:44,220
It's so strange that nobody has built on it.

1556
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:45,860
Well we still own the property.

1557
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:49,520
Since before I can remember,
I've had the same dream.

1558
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,350
Benjie and me, getting married there.

1559
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:54,780
In a big white tent.
I didn't make any sense.

1560
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:57,060
And then I found out
about you and dad.

1561
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:59,090
You were in Europe, I...

1562
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:02,560
... found a key to the lock box,
all the pictures.

1563
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:06,170
We didn't know we were
brother and sister.

1564
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:11,370
We've been separated
since we were kids.

1565
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,650
It was a freak thing, we...

1566
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,210
... met on campus, in the desert...

1567
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:23,260
Agatha, we didn't know.

1568
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,880
We didn't know.

1569
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,120
What are you doing here?

1570
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:40,590
Stafford, it's alright.

1571
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,940
I told you to stay away from us.

1572
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,880
You didn't know.

1573
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,660
It was a freak thing.

1574
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,640
I found the diaries.

1575
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:56,140
Love is stronger than death.

1576
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:05,090
- You crazy cunt!
- Stafford!

1577
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,380
- Daddy no!

1578
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:10,950
Get off her!

1579
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,000
Okay.

1580
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:21,930
Okay.

1581
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,900
- Gotto go! Gotto go!
- Don't take her!

1582
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,930
- Gotto go!
- Don't take her!

1583
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:30,270
- Don't take her!
- Let me go!

1584
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:56,110
My ring.

1585
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,440
She took my wedding ring.

1586
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,510
My ring.

1587
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,700
Piss patrol!

1588
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,930
Caught in the act.

1589
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,960
You know...

1590
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,090
You're chewing some major
scenery out there.

1591
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:37,890
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

1592
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:40,760
Va-bina head!

1593
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,400
Who's the star of the show?

1594
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,290
Huh?!

1595
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,160
Can you tell me that, Roy?

1596
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:49,260
Uh... you are?

1597
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:53,000
He's not your enemy.

1598
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,150
You!

1599
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:59,800
Love is stronger than death.

1600
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,280
You're... a bad babysitter, Benjamin!

1601
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,670
You die!

1602
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:10,830
DIE!

1603
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,890
You're a bad babysitter!

1604
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,570
Fuck.

1605
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,460
Fuck!

1606
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,530
Fuck!

1607
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,580
He maybe groggy
from the medication.

1608
01:25:58,900 --> 01:25:59,540
Oh.

1609
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:04,610
Oh my baby! My baby!
My baby! My baby...

1610
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,850
I'm so sorry, mom.

1611
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:13,920
Why?

1612
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,890
Benjie, why did you do it?

1613
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:18,970
He was just a little boy...

1614
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:23,750
I saw her and...

1615
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,900
Who, baby? Agatha?

1616
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:29,340
Did Agatha come to see you?

1617
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,750
Little girl.
She tricked me.

1618
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:34,000
What little girl?

1619
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,820
From the hospital.
The one that died.

1620
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:39,620
I keep seeing.

1621
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:44,070
Oh, my baby!
My baby! My baby!

1622
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,670
Oh my baby! Oh my baby!
Oh my baby! Oh my baby.

1623
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:51,260
We've got to get him home.

1624
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:54,130
I'd like to place him
outside of California.

1625
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:57,320
We need Jonas to speak
with the district attorney.

1626
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,260
He's only 13.

1627
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:05,260
We have to factor in
the violence of the assault, Christina.

1628
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:09,470
He didn't take a gun to a kid at school, Harriet!
He hurt one boy. One boy!

1629
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:12,420
The state's become
very tough on minors.

1630
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:15,180
They won't send him to jail?

1631
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,920
They won't send him to jail.

1632
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,680
Boy's gonna be alright.

1633
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,680
Oh, thank God!

1634
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:29,980
They've shut down production.

1635
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,990
I don't know if
they are gonna recast.

1636
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:37,970
But it's such a small little part, what?

1637
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:40,620
BENJIE!
They are talking about recasting BENJIE!

1638
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,270
- My god.
- It's over!

1639
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,360
DONE!

1640
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,710
Now the whole world...

1641
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:49,180
... will know.

1642
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:56,810
The world will know
we have done crimes.

1643
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:00,330
Hope you don't mind
that I requested you.

1644
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:02,610
No, I'm glad.

1645
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:05,460
God!

1646
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:09,510
I feel shitty.
I think I've got bronchitis.

1647
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,610
Kind of makes your voice sound sexy.

1648
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:12,650
Thank you.

1649
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,740
So, how's the romance going?

1650
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:19,560
It's alright. It's pretty good.

1651
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,660
What's that all about for you?

1652
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:26,710
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know...

1653
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:28,430
... the burn thing?

1654
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,170
Was it creepy...

1655
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,470
... to fuck her?

1656
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:39,130
Uh, not really.

1657
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,520
Did she take her gloves off?

1658
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,660
Do your friends think it's weird?

1659
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:53,670
Have your friends even met her?

1660
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,980
I've kind of tried to...

1661
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,750
... try to write a script about it.

1662
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,880
Research.

1663
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,440
Everything is research on some level.

1664
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:11,820
Mm.

1665
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,690
Would you fuck me if I asked you to?
For research?

1666
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:24,930
I don't know.

1667
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,380
How would we do it?

1668
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:31,880
Can you see me?

1669
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,620
Look at what I'm doing.

1670
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:39,380
How would we fuck?

1671
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,220
From behind.

1672
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,830
We could if you want.

1673
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,190
I want.

1674
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:49,360
For a long time.

1675
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:51,210
Yeah?

1676
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,260
Am I better looking... than her?

1677
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,320
Yeah.

1678
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:04,550
And my skin...

1679
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,320
... do I have better skin?

1680
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:08,640
Yeah.

1681
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,620
And my holes...

1682
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,620
... are my holes better?

1683
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:16,700
You wanna fuck my holes?

1684
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:17,560
Yeah.

1685
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:53,620
I got to go.

1686
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,740
Do me a favor?
Don't get out, just climb over.

1687
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,120
What happened to you?

1688
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,980
I took the bus.

1689
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:30,420
What's wrong with the car?

1690
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,520
It broke.

1691
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:34,860
What happened to you yesterday?

1692
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,910
I was sick.

1693
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,720
Yeah.

1694
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:38,920
I've been sick all week.

1695
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:42,730
I still manage to get up
at 5 in the morning and work for 14 hours.

1696
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:44,200
What's wrong with you?

1697
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,700
I think I have the flu.

1698
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,840
You're acting really weird.

1699
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:52,020
You're dirty.

1700
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,920
I'm sorry.

1701
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,130
Was it too much
trouble to just like text?

1702
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:59,310
I'm sorry.

1703
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,900
Stop saying that.

1704
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:03,780
Uh... you know.

1705
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:07,220
Maybe this isn't working out.
Maybe you need to just go back to Florida.

1706
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,110
You know.

1707
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:11,200
Go back to Kansas, Dorothy.
It's fine.

1708
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:15,950
But, I wish you wouldn't just sit there,
like that because it's creeping me out.

1709
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,370
You smell.

1710
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,740
You smell! You hear me?

1711
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:24,860
Go home and take a bath!

1712
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,660
I'm sorry.

1713
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:29,340
Oh my God!

1714
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:30,880
You bled!

1715
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:33,700
Don't you...
don't you use fucking Tampax?!

1716
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,340
Are you psychotic?

1717
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:36,150
I'm sorry.

1718
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:39,350
I don't... I don't believe this.
My... my crazy assistant just...

1719
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,570
... bled on my 12 000 dollar couch!

1720
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,670
I don't want you in my life!

1721
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,340
You sick fucking pig!

1722
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,700
I'm sorry, I'll pay for...

1723
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:51,010
Go to the kitchen and
get Pari A and bleach.

1724
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:53,030
And Google the best way
to get rid of a stain.

1725
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:54,680
I... I pick you up off the streets.

1726
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,760
I give you money
so you could be late for work.

1727
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:59,920
And have you period on my furniture!

1728
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:02,210
Do you... do you think that Carrie Fisher...

1729
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:05,570
Do you... do you think
Nicole Kidman and Halle Berry

1730
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:07,830
have scary little animals working for them?

1731
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:09,640
Scary, deformed...

1732
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:04,560
Hi, Agatha.

1733
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:07,040
Benjie.

1734
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,820
I went AWOL and...

1735
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,790
I told an orderly that if
he let me leave slip out then...

1736
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,720
I give him... 10 000 dollars.

1737
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,780
Douche bag star fucker.

1738
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,030
How did you find me?

1739
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,930
You said you worked for her.

1740
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:30,770
And I've been up here before, so...

1741
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,990
Where's Havana?

1742
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:39,330
She went to the Canyon Ranch.
Damien gave her a couple of days off.

1743
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,580
I'm lost Agatha.

1744
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:53,720
I couldn't go to Rhetts and
I can't go home.

1745
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:58,470
Benjie, you have to listen to me
because there is nothing else.

1746
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,680
It's all ending now.
Do you understand?

1747
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:04,100
This is Christina's.

1748
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,440
You've got to get daddy's,
can you do that?

1749
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:08,860
Can you go to the house and
get daddy's ring?

1750
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,260
We're gonna keep it quiet
as long as we can.

1751
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:16,800
I don't want anything
interfering with the book tour.

1752
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:18,650
Worse case...

1753
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,660
I go on Oprah again.

1754
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:22,290
'Fess up.

1755
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:24,660
Do the whole Lance Armstrong thing.

1756
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:27,930
That'll build us a fresh money stream.

1757
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,580
So, we kick it off Monday morning.
With GMA, play as it plays.

1758
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:35,570
Ciao.

1759
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,040
Christina?!

1760
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,180
Christina?!

1761
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,870
Christina?!

1762
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:33,790
Christina!?

1763
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,660
Christina!

1764
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,140
Dad?!

1765
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,980
Dad?

1766
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:19,600
I haven't taken these many before.

1767
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:29,600
That was so brave of you.

1768
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:32,400
To go back there.

1769
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,850
I just slipped it off his finger.

1770
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,080
Just like he wanted me to have it.

1771
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:24,930
We should start.

1772
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,790
I've had 13 summers.

1773
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,740
Not so bad.

1774
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:33,930
