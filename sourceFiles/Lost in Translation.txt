00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:09,288
~ Welcome to New Tokyo
International Airport. Welcome. ~

2
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:31,865
- Welcome to Tokyo.
- Thank you very much.

3
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:35,169
- My name is Kawasaki.
- Nice to meet you.

4
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,336
- For you.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:38,372
- And Mr. Mori from Suntory.
- Hi.

6
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:40,507
- And Miss Shibata.
- Hey, I need that.

7
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,342
And Mr. Awinami.

8
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:43,544
Nice to meet you.

9
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:44,878
All right. Thank you.

10
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,347
- And Mr. Tanaka.
- Thank you. Thank you.

11
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,783
And we will pick you up
in the morning?

12
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:52,052
- Okay.
- Okay.
- See you tomorrow.

13
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:54,721
Great. Short and sweet.
Very Japanese. I like that.

14
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:56,023
My pleasure.

15
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:57,591
Yeah, get some sleep, will you?

16
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,761
We're all ... You're all really tired,
I'm sure. See you tomorrow.

17
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,663
- Good night.
- Thank you. Thank you.

18
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:04,608
Thank you ... What's this?

19
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,244
Something good?

20
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:14,683
Thank you.

21
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:27,487
- Mr. Harris, welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,125
This way, please.

23
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,093
Mr. Harris, pleased to welcome.

24
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,494
- Thank you.
- Have a nice stay with us.

25
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:35,973
This way.

26
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,967
Mr. Harris,
welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.

27
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,335
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your stay with us.

28
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:42,541

Yeah.

34
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:38,492
- You see that guy?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:39,993
You know who that is?

36
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,094
It's not him.

37
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,196
It looks like him, but it's not him.

38
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:45,198
Can you believe it?

39
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:46,333
Okay, maybe it is.

40
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,768
He's here with us.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

41
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:49,069
Shut up. Shut up.

42
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,205
Bob? Bob Harris?
You're awesome, man!

43
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,274
Sunset Odds. Loved it.

44
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:57,110
- Man, that car chase,
- I couldn't believe it.

45
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,113
Four buses ... and he took that
thing and everything exploded.

46
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:02,282
- I heard he did his own driving.
- I don't know.

47
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,084
Did you do your own driving?

48
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:05,519
- I did.
- Cool.

49
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,953
So, what are you doing here?

50
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,193
Yeah.

51
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,825
Um ... seeing friends.
Seeing friends.

52
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,736
- Yeah?
- Great.

53
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,195
We're here on business.

54
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:16,763
♪ I can see it in your eyes ♪

55
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:18,031
Later.

56
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,134
- See you, Bob.
- Keep it up.

57
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:22,433
Are you awake?

58
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,401
John.

59
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,975
Go to sleep.

60
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:39,940
Moshi moshi.

61
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,885
Yeah, I'm coming down.

62
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,683
Okay.

63
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,947
I gotta go to work.

64
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:48,114
Okay.

65
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,716
I love you. I'll see you later.

66
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:50,819
Okay. Bye.

67
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:55,320
Mr. Bob-san.

68
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:04,194
Suntory whisky.

69
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,809
Casablanca. Bogie.

70
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:21,783
Suntory time.

71
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:25,315
He want you to turn, look in camera.

72
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:27,286
Okay?

73
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:29,749
That's all he said?

74
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:30,852
Yes.

75
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:32,359
Turn to camera.

76
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:38,625
All right, does he want me
to turn from the right,

77
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,332
or turn from the left?

78
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:08,555
Passionate. Camera. Passion.

79
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:11,399
Right side and with intensity.

80
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:13,193
Okay?

81
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:15,829
Is that everything? I mean,
it seemed like he said ...

82
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:17,530
quite a bit more than that.

83
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,910
Whisky.

84
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:26,413
Gently.

85
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,176
Tension.

86
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:33,247
Like an old friend,
and into the camera.

87
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:35,488
Okay.

88
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:38,985
Whisky.

89
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,897
It's Suntory time! Okay?

90
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:43,926
Okay.

91
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:45,460
Okay?

92
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,965
- Hey, come on!
- Come on, come on, come on.

93
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:59,477
For relaxing times,

94
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,246
make it Suntory time.

95
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,123
Cut-o! Cut-o, cut-o,
cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

96
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,391
Could you do it slower ...

97
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:22,100
and with more intensity?

98
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,045
Suntory time.

99
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,428
For relaxing times,

100
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:50,161
make it Suntory time.

101
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:56,773
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

102
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,308
Hello?

103
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:16,442
Lauren?

104
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:17,716
Charlotte! Hey!

105
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:19,679
Hey.

106
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,014
Oh, my God. How's Tokyo?

107
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:24,290
It's great here.
It's really great. Um ...

108
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,653
I don't know ...
I went to this shrine today.

109
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:28,359
- Mmm-hmm?
- And ...

110
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:32,592
there were these monks,
and they were chanting.

111
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:36,696
And I didn't feel anything.
You know?

112
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:40,109
And I don't know ...

113
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,736
I even tried ikebana, and John
is using these hair products.

114
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,572
I just ...
I don't know who I married.

115
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:48,007
Look, can you wait a second?
Just hold on. I'll be right back.

116
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,383
Okay, sure.

117
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:53,079
Sorry. What were you saying?

118
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,215
Nothing. It's okay.
I'll call you later. Okay?

119
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:59,419
Okay. Have the best time. Just call
me when you get back. Okay? Bye.

120
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:00,659
- Bye.
- Love you.

121
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,733
God!

122
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,490
Ow.

123
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:17,540
At the fitting today,
they had all these ...

124
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,666
rock-and-roll clothes,

125
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,567
but the band wasn't tough at all.

126
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,703
The label guy just kept saying,
"More lock and loll,"

127
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,204
but it's just so much better ...

128
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:28,441
if they're just skinny and nerdy
like they came in, you know.

129
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,144
They're making them wear all these
Keith Richards clothes,

130
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:32,512
and it's just ridiculous.

131
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:35,381
They should let them be who they are.
Don't you think? I mean ...

132
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:36,816
Yeah.

133
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,518
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying.

134
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:41,692
But then you try to ...
I mean, you know ...

135
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:44,624
That's what I think.

136
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,626
Do you think this is done?

137
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:51,875
I don't know. I don't know.

138
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:57,003
Would you ...
Would you please stop smoking?

139
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:59,005
I like to. I don't really
smoke that much.

140
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,951
It's just so bad for you, though.

141
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:03,746
Well, I'll stop later.

142
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,790
Welcome back, Mr. Harris.

143
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,992
Yes, Mr. Harris.

144
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:21,096
- Please.
- Thank you.

145
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,504
- Mr. Harris?
- Yes?

146
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:06,672
- Mr. Kazu sent me.
- Oh?

147
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,116
May I enter?

148
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:12,211
Thank you.

149
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,712
Do you like massage?

150
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:18,051
I don't think
I like massage anymore.

151
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:21,122
Mr. Kazu sends premium fantasy.

152
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:25,468
My stockings, lip them.

153
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:30,803
Lip my stockings.

154
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:33,707
Yes, please.

155
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,607
Lip them.

156
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,805
What?

157
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,215
Lip them.

158
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:44,477
Hey! Lip my stocking!

159
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:47,146
Hey! "Lip" them?
"Lip" them? What?

160
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:50,216
Lip them. Like this.
Lip them.

161
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:51,717
- Rip them?
- Lip, yes.

162
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,319
You want me to rip
your stockings?

163
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,254
Yes, lip my stockings, please.

164
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:56,722
- Rip your stockings.
- Yes.

165
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,724
- You want me to rip your stockings.
- Please? Please? Please?

166
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,226
All right, I'm gonna
rip your stockings,

167
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:02,829
and you tell Mr. Kazu ...
you know ... we had a blast.

168
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:05,665
Oh, no! Mr. Harris!
Oh, my God!

169
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:07,266
Don't touch me!

170
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:10,372
Mr. Bob Harris, don't touch me!

171
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:12,505
Just lip my stocking!

172
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:15,144
Oh, no, Mr. Harris!

173
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,811
- Oh, no! Help! Help!
- Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,114
- Help, please! Help, please!
- Okay.

175
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:23,082
- Mr. Harris, help, please.
- Careful with those.

176
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:27,053
- Oh! Help, please! Help, please!
- Come on. Come on.

177
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,489
Let me go, Mr. Harris!

178
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:31,824
- Oh, no! Let me go!
- Come on. Come on.

179
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:35,294
- Oh! Let me go! Let me go.
- Oh, crap.

180
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,462
- Please let me go.
- With pleasure.

181
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:41,035
Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris,
don't let me go! No!

182
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:45,238
No! Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris!

183
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,174
Oh, please.

184
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:49,550
Let me go, please!

185
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:38,925
Hi! Mr. Harris, good morning.

186
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,126
Hi.

187
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:42,628
Hello. We just got
a request from Tanabe Mori.

188
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,230
He is the Johnny Carson of Japan.

189
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,166
It is a big honor to
be invited to his show.

190
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,168
Can you stay here until Friday?

191
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:54,340
I'm surprised and honored, but I
think I need to check with my agent.

192
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,742
- Okay.
- I believe I may have a previous commitment.

193
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,544
- Sure.
- Okay. I understand.

194
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:00,023
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

195
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,603
I think you should do it.

196
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:25,471
No, hear this, Fred.

197
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,341
I gotta be on a plane
Thursday night.

198
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:29,976
We're looking into it, Bob.

199
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:32,845
They really want you to stay
and do that talk show.

200
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,257
Apparently, he's a really big deal ...

201
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:38,184
Johnny Carson of Japan. Yeah.

202
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:41,687
Bob, these people are paying you a lot.
Would you please consider it?

203
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:44,890
I already have. You know,
I gotta get out of here.

204
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,325
As soon as I can.

205
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:48,160
All right, you're scheduled
to leave Friday,

206
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,962
but we'll hold it for you Saturday.

207
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:51,230
All right, now ...

208
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,567
You're breaking up, Fred. There's
no reception in this studio.

209
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,273
Forget it. Call me back.

210
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,080
So, can you put your hand
close your face, please?

211
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,515
I'm sorry, Naka. What?

212
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:13,793
Can you put your hand close
your face? Close your face.

213
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,692
I don't get that close to the
glass until I'm on the floor.

214
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:20,893
How's this?

215
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:24,440
Yes. You want a whisky?

216
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:30,536
This is not whiskey. This is iced tea.
If you gave me real whisky ...

217
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,571
I need mysterious face.

218
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:34,774
Can you show mysterious?
Mysterious.

219
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:37,543
I think I know what you want.
You want this, right?

220
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:40,182
I need more mysterious and ...

221
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:41,580
More mysterious. Yeah.

222
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,650
I'll just try to think,
"Where the hell's the whisky?"

223
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,256
You are a movie star, yes?

224
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:52,958
Yes, I should be doing movies,
yes, but ...

225
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,334
And Lat Pack.

226
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,664
Lat Pack.
You know Lat Pack?

227
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,231
- Rat ... Rat Pack?
- Rat Pack. Yes, please.

228
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,607
Oh, Rat Pack.

229
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:08,250
I need more tension, please.

230
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:11,410
More ...

231
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:16,625
You so gentleman, yes?

232
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:18,989
- A Ring-a-Ding Ding!
- Yeah.

233
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:22,221
Sinatora. You know Sinatora?

234
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:25,361
- Ol' Blue Eyes.
- Yeah.

235
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,294
That's good. Yeah.

236
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:29,929
That's more of Dino. That's Dino.

237
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

238
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,170
Great.

239
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,439
- Joey Bishop would you like?
- Yes. Just change film.

240
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:43,542
Are you drinking? No?

241
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:44,610
- Am I drinking?
- Yeah.

242
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,278
As soon as I'm done.

243
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:48,114
- Okay, close your hand, please.
- Huh?

244
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:50,116
- Close your hand. Yeah.
- Close it?

245
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:52,218
Yes. Close your face, please.

246
00:22:52,218 --> 00:22:54,220
- Close my ...
- Yes. Sorry.

247
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:57,432
And 007?

248
00:22:57,757 --> 00:22:59,492
He drinks martinis, but okay,
I got it.

249
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:01,026
007, yeah.

250
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:02,266
Loger Moore?

251
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:04,530
- Loger Moore?
- Loger Moore.

252
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,132
You know Loger Moore?

253
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:07,333
- Roger Moore?
- Yeah.

254
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,335
Okay. I ...

255
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:10,536
I always think of Sean Connery.
Seriously.

256
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:11,670
No, no.

257
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,938
Didn't you get the Sean Connery
one over here?

258
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,008
- No. Loger Moore.
- Okay.

259
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,047
Yes.

260
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,180
- Loger Moore?
- No ...

261
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,422
- Yeah.
- Okay.

262
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,121
Yeah, okay. Good.

263
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,852
More. Please.

264
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,764
- You mean "more," or Roger Moore again?
- Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,365
Good.

266
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,195

Thank you.
We're glad to be here.

274
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:13,941
We're Sausalito.

275
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,415
They're beautiful.

276
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:31,750
- They're beautiful, yeah.
- You know?

277
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,026
Send these over to
that table over there.

278
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:36,564
- Old temple?
- An old temple?

279
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:38,123
Yeah.

280
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:39,358
Oh, beautiful, man.

281
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:42,695
Excuse me, sir.
From the woman over there.

282
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:45,004
Oh! Oh, they are?
Really?

283
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,699
- Yeah, yeah.
- What's ... What's ...

284
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:50,236
Is Japan ...
Is it mainly Buddhism here?

285
00:24:50,236 --> 00:24:52,238
Yeah, it's Buddhism.

286
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:55,307
- CD or ...
- Yeah, CD.

287
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:56,509
Playing her ...

288
00:24:56,509 --> 00:25:00,246
- Oh, she plays ... Guitar?
- Guitar. Guitar.

289
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:01,952
That's a beautiful job.

290
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:37,315
Help!

291
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:02,541
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

292
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,209
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

293
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:06,211
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

294
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:09,623
Car is outside. Shall we go?

295
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,859
That's what I told him.

296
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:17,790
- But if ...
- Yeah.

297
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,530
- He never listens.
- Yeah.

298
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:24,366
John?

299
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:27,539
Oh, my God! John!
What are you doing here?

300
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,737
Oh, well, you know,
I'm just here, shooting a band.

301
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:32,805
What about you?

302
00:26:32,805 --> 00:26:34,106
I'm here promoting that
action movie I did.

303
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:38,243
You know! I'm doing
20 million interviews a day.

304
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:39,912
It's crazy.

305
00:26:39,912 --> 00:26:42,281
- God, it is so good to see you!
- Yeah. Yeah.

306
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:43,882
So, how long are you gonna be here?

307
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:46,018
We're here for a week.

308
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:47,553
I'm gonna go shoot in Fukawaka.

309
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,189
- Oh, it's amazing!
- Yeah.

310
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:52,057
- It's amazing.
- Oh, yeah.

311
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:58,263
Oh, this is ...
This is my wife, Charlotte.

312
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,765
Hi! It's really nice to meet you!

313
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:01,000
Hi. Nice to meet you.

314
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,501
- Hello!
- Yeah!

315
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,714
- Wife?
- Yeah. Yeah.

316
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:08,507
- John. John.
- Huh?

317
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:09,975
You are my favorite photographer.

318
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:13,012
- Oh, come on!
- No, you are.
I only want you to shoot me.

319
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,458
It's true!

320
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:20,285
I have the worst B.O. right now.
I'm so sorry.

321
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,554
No, no, no. But listen,

322
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:24,723
let's all go out for a drink sometime.
- Yeah.

323
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:28,293
- You know? Call me. Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

324
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:30,295
Listen, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.

325
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:32,531
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Shh. Okay?

326
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,133
- Okay.
- Yeah.

327
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:36,010
Okay, arigato, arigato.

328
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:38,011
Moshi moshi!

329
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:40,873
Evelyn Waugh?

330
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:42,818
- What?
- Evelyn Waugh was a man.

331
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,982
Oh, come on. She's nice.

332
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:49,416
What? You know ... you know,
not everybody went to Yale.

333
00:27:50,683 --> 00:27:53,252
It was just a pseudonym,
for Christ's sake.

334
00:27:53,252 --> 00:27:55,187
Why do you have to defend her?

335
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:58,257
Well, why do you have to point out
how stupid everybody is all the time?

336
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:00,396
I thought it was funny.
Forget it.

337
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:02,336
Well ...

338
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:06,207
- Hey, John, we gotta go.
- Oh. Yeah.

339
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:07,908
Bye.

340
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,273
Did you ever wonder what
your purpose in life is?

341
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:17,876
This book is about finding
your soul's purpose or destiny.

342
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:21,915
Every soul has its path, but
sometimes that path is not clear.

343
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:24,550
The Inner Map Theory
is an example ...

344
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,618
of how each soul begins
with an imprint,

345
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:30,022
all compacted into a pattern that
has been selected by your soul ...

346
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:31,660
before you've even gotten here.

347
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:41,033
You know, I guess the reason why
I like Japan the best ...

348
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,534
out of all Asian countries,

349
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:47,072
is because I really feel
close to Buddhism.

350
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:48,273
I really feel ...

351
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:50,209
I really believe in reincarnation.

352
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:53,378
That's part of what drew me
to Midnight Velocity as well,

353
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:56,215
because although Keanu dies,

354
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:58,784
he eventually gets reincarnated.

355
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:01,954
So there's hope. There's hope
in reincarnation, I think.

356
00:29:01,954 --> 00:29:04,923
What was it like
working with Keanu Reeves?

357
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:08,994
He was always so ... He was always,
you know, giving me ideas,

358
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:10,596
and, you know, really helpful.

359
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:12,631
He made me feel
really comfortable, so ...

360
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:16,735
And we both have two dogs,
and we both live in L.A.,

361
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:19,681
so we have all these
different things in common.

362
00:29:19,972 --> 00:29:22,875
So, you know, we both
really like Mexican food,

363
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:25,878
and yoga and ...

364
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:27,246
karate!

365
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,087
Mexican food. Yoga.

366
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,201
Konnichiwa.

367
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:50,873
- Hello.
- Hi.

368
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:11,697
Okay.

369
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:20,709
- Okay.
- Okay.

370
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:35,678
He got married
a couple of times ...

371
00:31:37,643 --> 00:31:38,844
to some nice women.

372
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:42,047
Beautiful women too. I mean, you and
I would be crazy for these women.

373
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:44,220
But there were always rumors.

374
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:46,952
I never liked his acting,

375
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:49,955
so I never gave a damn
whether he was straight or not.

376
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:52,162
Thank you. Hi. Thanks.

377
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:54,293
What can I get you?

378
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:57,035
I'm not sure.

379
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:02,501
For relaxing times,

380
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,503
make it Suntory time.

381
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,807
I'll have a vodka tonic.

382
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:11,284
Thanks.

383
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:18,525
So, what are you doing here?

384
00:32:20,152 --> 00:32:21,722
A couple of things.

385
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,362
Taking a break from my wife,
forgetting my son's birthday ...

386
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:28,360
and getting paid $2 million ...

387
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,430
to endorse a whisky ...

388
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:33,306
when I could be doing
a play somewhere.

389
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:36,204
Oh.

390
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:39,748
But the good news is,
the whisky works.

391
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:48,913
What are you doing?

392
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:52,718
My husband's a photographer,

393
00:32:52,718 --> 00:32:55,061
so he's here working,

394
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,823
and I wasn't doing anything,
so I came along.

395
00:32:57,823 --> 00:33:00,235
And we have some friends
that live here.

396
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,160
How long have you
been married?

397
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,400
Thank you.

398
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:06,469
Two years.

399
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:08,970
Twenty-five long ones.

400
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,408
You're probably just
having a midlife crisis.

401
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:16,146
Did you buy a Porsche yet?

402
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:20,785
You know, I was thinking
about buying a Porsche.

403
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:27,191
Twenty-five years. That's a ...

404
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,624
Well, it's impressive.

405
00:33:32,591 --> 00:33:35,970
Well, you figure you sleep
one-third of your life.

406
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:38,497
That knocks off eight years of
marriage right there.

407
00:33:38,497 --> 00:33:40,999
So you're down to 16 and change.

408
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,135
You're just a teenager at marriage.

409
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:46,707
You can drive it, but there's
still the occasional accident.

410
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:48,008
Yeah.

411
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:50,916
What do you do?

412
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:57,416
I'm not sure yet, actually.

413
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,327
I just graduated last spring.

414
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:01,720
What did you study?

415
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:03,297
Philosophy.

416
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:06,124
Yeah, there's a good buck
in that racket.

417
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:07,398
Yeah.

418
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,338
Well, so far it's pro bono.

419
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:15,133
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure out the angles.

420
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,270
Yeah.

421
00:34:18,904 --> 00:34:21,145
I hope your Porsche works out.

422
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,442
Cheers to that, huh?

423
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:24,709
Cheers to that.

424
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,156
Wish I could sleep.

425
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,430

Oh, it was good, you know.
I'm tired.

434
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:54,092
Yeah, I gotta go downstairs
and meet Kelly for some drinks.

435
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:56,194
She wants to talk about
some photo thing.

436
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:58,333
Maybe I'll go downstairs with you.

437
00:36:58,964 --> 00:37:00,443
Oh, you wanna come?

438
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,006
Yeah, sure.

439
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:04,811

443
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:18,450
And I'm like, "No, I'm not."

444
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,286
I eat so much junk food,
you wouldn't believe it.

445
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:23,021
Just because I have
a high metabolism.

446
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:25,023
Because I thought
you were anorexic too.

447
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:26,524
Everybody does.
Everybody thinks that.

448
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,560
Yeah, 'cause you look so ...

449
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,729
Thank you. I know, but it's ...

450
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:33,598
I mean, I eat whatever.
I have a really high metabolism.

451
00:37:33,598 --> 00:37:35,168
- Yeah.
- But ...

452
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,975
My dad is an anorexic.

453
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,518
- Really?
- Oh, really?

454
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:45,210
Yeah.

455
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,158
He fought on the American side
of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.

456
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,182
He was taken prisoner,

457
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,653
and the whole time he was there
they tortured him about food.

458
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:57,656
Every day they told him
they put poison in the food.

459
00:37:57,656 --> 00:38:00,925
So they would always make themselves
throw up after every meal.

460
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,632
That's horrible. That's terrible.

461
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:06,431
That's some crazy shit.

462
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:07,799
- You don't think he sounds kinda goofy?
- No.

463
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,835
You know that break beat, right?

464
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,237
Well, I been taking it
to some next level shit.

465
00:38:12,237 --> 00:38:14,606
Like, I'll take that and put
a delay on it, so it's like ...

466
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,078
So it's, like, evolving the beat.

467
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:23,957
So it, like, sounds hella large on
the track. You know what I'm saying?

468
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:26,117
- No.
- No?

469
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:27,960
You don't listen to hip-hop?

470
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,459
Oh, my God!
You guys gotta listen.

471
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:33,692
I tried this power cleanse.
It's so amazing.

472
00:38:33,692 --> 00:38:35,093
Okay, promise me you'll try it.

473
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:36,594
Will you try this power cleanse?

474
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:38,530
- I did it last week, and it's amazing.
- I'll be right back.

475
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,666
It's so good to get the toxins
out of your body, you know.

476
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:44,840
With all, like, the pollution,
all, like, the ...

477
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:51,409
- Hello.
- Hello.

478
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:53,183
You ever switch seats?

479
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:58,316
I like this one. If I fall,
someone will notice.

480
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:00,490
Yeah.

481
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:03,229
So, you having a nice time?

482
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:05,459
Can you keep a secret?

483
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:08,026
I'm trying to organize
a prison break.

484
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:10,061
I'm looking for, like,
an accomplice.

485
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:14,532
We'd have to, first,
get out of this bar.

486
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:18,536
Then the hotel, then the city
and then the country.

487
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:20,438
Are you in, or are you out?

488
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:21,539
I'm in.

489
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:23,541
Good. I'll go pack my stuff.

490
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:24,642
Get your coat.

491
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:25,813
See you.

492
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,255
I hope you've had enough to drink.
It's gonna take courage.

493
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:39,466
Oh, look. The label got me these.

494
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:42,428
I love Cristal.
You wanna have some?

495
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:46,837
Well, I'm ... I gotta go.
I mean, I ...

496
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:52,303
You know, you don't have to stay.

497
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:53,438
I mean ...

498
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:54,672
You don't have to go, do you?

499
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,709
Well, I ...

500
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:59,577
I know. You're gonna be
working the whole time.

501
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:00,812
I'll have a much better time here.

502
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:02,113
I'll call Charlie and those guys.

503
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:04,092
Yeah! Call those guys.

504
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:07,329
And I'm gonna be back
on Sunday, and I ...

505
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:09,925
I love you, you know.

506
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:15,001
Okay? I love you.

507
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,565
I'll see you. Okay?

508
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:23,001
Yeah, it's just gonna be a couple
of ... a couple of days.

509
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,135
Bye.

510
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:25,341
I love you.

511
00:41:30,602 --> 00:41:31,970
Hello.

512
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,271
- Hello.
- How are you?

513
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:34,681
- Good. How are you?

514
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:41,279
It's a cool pool, isn't it?

515
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:42,689
Yeah, it's nice.

516
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:46,584
Get any sleep?

517
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,757
Not yet. How about you?

518
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:51,232
No. Not yet.

519
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,325
How long you staying for?

520
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:56,694
I'll be in the bar for
the rest of the week.

521
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,436
Well, that's good.

522
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,176
I'm going out with some friends
later, if you wanna come ...

523
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:07,338
Sure.

524
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:09,147
Okay. I'll see you later.

525
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:11,352
- Okay.
- See you.

526
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:44,150
Which one is burgundy?

527
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:47,412
Hold on!

528
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:49,819
Hold on.

529
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:56,788
You really are having
a midlife crisis, huh?

530
00:42:56,788 --> 00:42:59,063
Really? Yeah, I was afraid of that.

531
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:04,171
I kept telling myself that I just wanted
to be ready in case we go to war tonight.

532
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:10,071
My bathroom is messier than yours.

533
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:17,475
And it's not like you're not trying.

534
00:43:17,475 --> 00:43:19,310
Here, will you cut the tag out for me?

535
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,413
Sure.

536
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,256
You're too tall.

537
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:29,153
Anybody ever tell you,
you may be too small?

538
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:31,322
Whose is this?

539
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:33,995
"A Soul's Search:
Finding Your True Calling."

540
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:35,565
I don't know.

541
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:39,399
- I have that.
- Did it work out for you, then?

542
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,941
Obviously.

543
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:47,278
Okay.

544
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:50,375
Where's your shoes?

545
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,476
They're over here.

546
00:43:51,476 --> 00:43:52,710
Where's your room key?

547
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,847
It's in my bag.

548
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:55,546
And where's your bag?

549
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:56,786
It's right here.

550
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:58,483
- Let's go.
- Wait!

551
00:43:58,483 --> 00:43:59,617
There's the elevator.
I gotta go.

552
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:00,720
Hey!

553
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:07,295
- Hi! How are you?
- Hi, Charlie!

554
00:44:09,694 --> 00:44:11,503
Bob, this is Charlie Brown.

555
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:14,766
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

556
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:16,401
- This is Bambie.
- How are you, Bambie?

557
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,602
His real name's Hayashi, but ...

558
00:44:17,602 --> 00:44:19,170
Why do they call you
Charlie Brown?

559
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,006
Everybody say,
"He looks like Charlie Brown."

560
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:23,474
You know, Snoopy, man.

561
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:25,749
Oh, I'll be right back.

562
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:30,281
Bob, over here. These are my friends.
Very beautiful.

563
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:34,152
She's "B", and she's Rico,
and she's Myumi.

564
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:36,621
- Myumi. How are you? I'm Bob.
- Oh! Bob.

565
00:44:36,621 --> 00:44:38,956
Bob from United States, man.

566
00:44:40,158 --> 00:44:41,659
Hi, Bob.

567
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:43,394
Maybe you'd like to
sing backup for me.

568
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:44,829
This is my surfing teacher.

569
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,030
He's your surfing teacher?

570
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:49,033
- Sometime, sometime.
- You're a surfer?

571
00:45:25,837 --> 00:45:27,646
- The emperor's house?
- Cool.

572
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:32,746
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

573
00:45:36,547 --> 00:45:39,289
- Cool! Right.

574
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:41,686
You don't have anything ...
Do you have anything ...

575
00:45:41,686 --> 00:45:44,122
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

576
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:45,189
Good. How are you?

577
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:46,390
My Japanese is getting better.

578
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,292
We started speaking English.

579
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:55,940
Charlie.

580
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:04,108
Get out, guys!

581
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:06,212
- BBs!
- They sting!

582
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:15,319
Who are these guys, anyway?

583
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:23,531
Hey, hey, hey!

584
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,667
Oh, no.

585
00:46:49,387 --> 00:46:50,524
Hi.

586
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,233
Come on!

587
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,726
Hey, guys! Over here!

588
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:57,595
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

589
00:46:57,595 --> 00:46:58,763
Wait! Our tour guide!

590
00:46:58,763 --> 00:46:59,969
Hurry up!

591
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,541
- Yeah?
- Gorgeous.

592
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:12,810
- Gorgeous?
- Blonde and black.

593
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:20,318
Cheese. Cheese-o!

594
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:21,489
Cheese!

595
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:25,266
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hi.

596
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,659
- Hi, I'm Hans.
- Nice to meet you.

597
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:30,695
- I'm Charlotte.
- Nice to meet you.

598
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:32,773
- Hi.
- Hi.

599
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:40,238
- Last weekend, I went surfing.
- Right.

600
00:47:40,238 --> 00:47:43,875
About seven people, you know;
some of my friends.

601
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:47,745
And we camp over there on the beach.

602
00:47:49,146 --> 00:47:52,216
In fact, we made a kind of ...

603
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:54,252

Hey.

681
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:25,202
~ Hello, Bob. ~

682
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:28,772
Hey, you know, those carpet samples,

683
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:30,407
you were right about the burgundy.

684
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:32,176
It wasn't even close.

685
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:33,777
Blows the others away.

686
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:35,950
~ I'm glad you like it. ~

687
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:41,590
I saw a great house tonight
that you would've loved,

688
00:55:42,052 --> 00:55:44,488
and that burgundy would've
been good in this house, really.

689
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:45,723
~ Really? ~

690
00:55:45,723 --> 00:55:48,325
A guy designed his
own house and built it.

691
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:50,771
~ Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it. ~

692
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:56,075
He's a fashion guy.
All these fashion people were there.

693
00:55:56,934 --> 00:56:00,104
And there were
Japanese surfers there,

694
00:56:00,104 --> 00:56:04,942
and the guy was playing
really, really, really great music.

695
00:56:04,942 --> 00:56:07,378
I should've found out
what it was and brought some ...

696
00:56:07,378 --> 00:56:09,880
I'll bring some back.
I'll try to find out.

697
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,249
~ That sounds great.
Can you hold on? ~

698
00:56:14,685 --> 00:56:18,489
~ You have to have something for
breakfast. Do you want some cereal? ~

699
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:20,424
Tell her I said
she's gotta eat something.

700
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:22,793
~ I'm just trying to get her
to eat something. ~

701
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:25,429
Yeah. Tell her I said
she has to eat something.

702
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:28,432
~ Your dad says eat something.
- No. ~

703
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:30,667
Eat. Tell her I said so.

704
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,908
~ She won't eat anything.
Forget it. ~

705
00:56:33,404 --> 00:56:35,508
~ Look, I'm glad you're having fun. ~

706
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,020
It's not fun. It's just ...
It's just very, very different.

707
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:42,148
~ Maybe that's good. ~

708
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:46,049
~ I have to get the kids off
for school, okay? ~

709
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:47,994
~ So, can I call you in a while? ~

710
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:52,390
I might not be up.
It's ... it's, like, 4:00.

711
00:56:53,757 --> 00:56:56,860
~ Well, you better get some sleep.
You have work in the morning. ~

712
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,272
No, actually,
they gave me tomorrow off.

713
00:56:59,997 --> 00:57:01,840
~ That must be nice. ~

714
00:57:04,902 --> 00:57:07,814
~ All right. Well, thanks
for checking in. I gotta go. ~

715
00:57:08,205 --> 00:57:10,774
- All right. Have a great, great night.
~ All right. ~

716
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:13,277
I mean, I guess have
a great morning, huh?

717
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:15,546
~ Good night, Bob. Good night. ~

718
00:57:15,546 --> 00:57:16,649
Good night.

719
00:57:18,816 --> 00:57:20,022
I love you.

720
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:24,392
That was a stupid idea.

721
00:58:36,793 --> 00:58:38,362
- I was feeling tight, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

722
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:40,205
- Shoulders and neck.
- Mmm-hmm.

723
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:42,969
So I called down and had a ...

724
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:45,702
shiatsu massage in my room.

725
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:47,004
That's nice.

726
00:58:47,004 --> 00:58:50,246
And the tightness has
completely disappeared ...

727
00:58:50,641 --> 00:58:52,484
and been replaced by ...

728
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:55,315
unbelievable pain.

729
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:58,448
Just staggering, unbearable pain.

730
00:58:58,448 --> 00:58:59,783
That's too bad.

731
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:01,318
- Yeah.
- I'm in pain.

732
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:06,130
I got my foot banged up, and ...
Wanna see it?

733
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:08,859
How do you say "No"?

734
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:11,161
- Oh, my gosh!
- I know.

735
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:12,162
That's ...

736
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:13,730
How ... when did you do this?

737
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,166
I did it the other day.
It hurts, you know?

738
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,035
Didn't you feel any pain? Your ...

739
00:59:18,035 --> 00:59:19,736
Yeah, it really hurt.
It was ...

740
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,672
Yeah. That toe is almost dead.

741
00:59:22,806 --> 00:59:24,274
I think I gotta take you
to a doctor.

742
00:59:24,274 --> 00:59:26,476
You can't just put that
back in the shoe.

743
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:28,245
No. I don't think so.

744
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:30,847
Well, you either go to a doctor,
or you leave it here.

745
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,454
He's smiling.
You like that idea?

746
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:38,322
See, they love black toe
over in this country.

747
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:40,233
You got a sharp knife?

748
00:59:40,524 --> 00:59:42,392
Gotta be, you know,
in this country,

749
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:44,194
somebody's gotta
prefer a black toe.

750
00:59:45,495 --> 00:59:46,863
"Brack toe."

751
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:50,105
Or we should probably hang around
until someone orders it.

752
00:59:50,701 --> 00:59:52,202
Hey, what's with the straight face?

753
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:54,471
Hospital regulations.
Get in there.

754
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:56,575
- All right. Thank you.
- All right.

755
00:59:59,776 --> 01:00:02,347
Careful, okay? No, don't!

756
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:04,915
- No!
- Hey, use the horn, fella.

757
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:12,696
Let's try "Mixed Internal".

758
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:15,436
Yeah. Go.
Switched to beer, huh?

759
01:00:15,993 --> 01:00:17,794
Go. Go.
You might want to switch to sake.

760
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:19,068
Stop.

761
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:23,201
Hi.

762
01:00:23,834 --> 01:00:24,968
- Hi.
- Hi.

763
01:00:26,103 --> 01:00:28,472
Yeah. We need a doctor.

764
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:30,774
For a hurt ... Emergency room.

765
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:33,584
It's not an emergency.
I just hurt my foot.

766
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:43,654
Okay, do we fill this out?
We go over there?

767
01:00:43,654 --> 01:00:45,064
Which number?

768
01:00:51,495 --> 01:00:54,331
We're not going to another hospital,
so whatever you say is okay.

769
01:00:54,331 --> 01:00:55,502
Okay.

770
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,641
Could you put that back
in the garage for us?

771
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:34,545
"In desuka"?

772
01:01:45,248 --> 01:01:48,454
Japan.

773
01:01:51,088 --> 01:01:52,089
Japan ...

774
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:53,990
After?

775
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:56,093
Japan ...

776
01:02:06,336 --> 01:02:10,249
Ahh-ah, so. Ahh-ah.

777
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:20,358
Ahh, so. Ahh ...

778
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:23,159
How's that song go?

779
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:37,342
Is that for me?

780
01:02:38,568 --> 01:02:39,978
Yeah, it can be for you.

781
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:15,472
Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte.

782
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:19,910
I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys
at this place called Orange around 10:00,

783
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:22,746
so I'll fax you a map
on how to get there.

784
01:03:22,746 --> 01:03:25,158

and meet us. Bye.

827
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:47,777
You know,
the first time I saw you,

828
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:50,280
you were wearing
a tuxedo at the bar.

829
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,084
You were very dashing.

830
01:07:52,615 --> 01:07:54,116
I liked the mascara.

831
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:03,293
But the first time I saw you
was in the elevator.

832
01:08:03,293 --> 01:08:04,461
Really?

833
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:05,530
You don't remember?

834
01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:11,340
I guess you do
kind of blend in, huh?

835
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:15,238
Did I scowl at you?

836
01:08:16,206 --> 01:08:17,807
No, you smiled.

837
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:18,908
I did?

838
01:08:18,908 --> 01:08:20,643
Yes, it was a complete accident.

839
01:08:20,643 --> 01:08:22,278
A freak. I haven't seen it since.

840
01:08:22,278 --> 01:08:25,088
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.

841
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:29,354
Bigger. Yeah, big, big ...

842
01:08:29,619 --> 01:08:31,098
Well, not that big.

843
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:34,229
~ My goodness. ~

844
01:08:40,964 --> 01:08:44,639
~ Marcello, come here. Hurry up. ~

845
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:51,144
Why do they switch the "R's" and
the "L's" here?

846
01:08:52,275 --> 01:08:54,778
Oh, for yuks.
You know, just to mix it up.

847
01:08:56,346 --> 01:08:59,282
They have to amuse themselves,
'cause we're not making them laugh.

848
01:09:02,852 --> 01:09:06,959
Let's never come here again,
'cause it would never be as much fun.

849
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:12,101
Whatever you say. You're the boss.

850
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,874
I'm stuck.

851
01:09:22,672 --> 01:09:24,151
Does it get easier?

852
01:09:24,841 --> 01:09:25,910
No.

853
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:29,284
Yes.

854
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:31,654
It gets easier.

855
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:33,989
Oh, yeah?

856
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:35,791
Look at you.

857
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:38,895
Thanks.

858
01:09:41,024 --> 01:09:43,293
The more you know who you are,

859
01:09:43,293 --> 01:09:44,863
and what you want,

860
01:09:45,562 --> 01:09:47,666
the less you let ...

861
01:09:48,464 --> 01:09:49,840
things upset you.

862
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:52,874
Yeah.

863
01:09:54,671 --> 01:09:57,151
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to be.

864
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,048
You know?

865
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,618
I tried being a writer, but ...

866
01:10:02,912 --> 01:10:04,380
I hate what I write.

867
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,259
And I tried taking pictures,

868
01:10:09,652 --> 01:10:11,688
but they're so mediocre, you know.

869
01:10:11,688 --> 01:10:14,828
Every girl goes through
a photography phase.

870
01:10:15,558 --> 01:10:17,162
You know, like horses?

871
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:22,439
You know?
Take dumb pictures of your feet.

872
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:26,439
You'll figure that out.

873
01:10:28,004 --> 01:10:29,744
I'm not worried about you.

874
01:10:33,309 --> 01:10:34,549
Keep writing.

875
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:41,554
But I'm so mean.

876
01:10:43,519 --> 01:10:45,362
- Mean's okay.
- Yeah?

877
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:55,008
What about marriage?
Does that get easier?

878
01:11:02,205 --> 01:11:03,479
That's hard.

879
01:11:09,412 --> 01:11:11,323
We used to have a lot of fun.

880
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:16,185
Lydia would come with me
when I made the movies,

881
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:18,858
and we would laugh about it all.

882
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:24,595
Now she doesn't want to leave
the kids, and she doesn't ...

883
01:11:26,663 --> 01:11:29,866
need me to be there.

884
01:11:29,866 --> 01:11:33,074
The kids miss me, but they're fine.

885
01:11:35,738 --> 01:11:39,583
It gets a whole lot more complicated
when you have kids.

886
01:11:40,009 --> 01:11:41,783
Yeah. It's scary.

887
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:47,317
It's the most terrifying
day of your life ...

888
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:49,421
the day the first one is born.

889
01:11:50,053 --> 01:11:52,590
Yeah. Nobody ever tells you that.

890
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:55,335
Your life,

891
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:57,700
as you know it,

892
01:11:58,161 --> 01:11:59,503
is gone.

893
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:02,339
Never to return.

894
01:12:05,001 --> 01:12:08,414
But they learn how to walk, and
they learn how to talk, and ...

895
01:12:09,339 --> 01:12:12,285
And you want to be with them.

896
01:12:13,343 --> 01:12:15,845
And they turn out to be the most ...

897
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:18,147
delightful people ...

898
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:20,116
you will ever meet in your life.

899
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:21,993
Hmm, that's nice.

900
01:12:36,299 --> 01:12:37,800
Where'd you grow up?

901
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:40,839
I grew up in New York,

902
01:12:41,804 --> 01:12:45,149
and I moved to Los Angeles
when John and I got married.

903
01:12:46,209 --> 01:12:48,052
But it's so different there.

904
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:50,384
Yeah, I know.

905
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:54,889
John thinks I'm so snotty.

906
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:16,973
You're not hopeless.

907
01:16:42,712 --> 01:16:43,815
Hello?

908
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,892
~ Mr. Harris? ~
- Yes.
~ A fax for you. ~

909
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:49,452
Okay. Can you send it up?

910
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:51,053
Do you think you could
kick it under the door for me,

911
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:52,955
slide it under the door
for me, please?

912
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:54,624
~ Do you want I send it
to your room? ~

913
01:16:54,624 --> 01:16:57,093
Just slide it under the door,
please. Thank you.

914
01:16:57,093 --> 01:16:59,402
~ Thank you, Mr. Harris. ~
- Okay. All right, bye.

915
01:17:34,764 --> 01:17:38,006
Hey, Ms. Kawasaki.
It's Bob Harris.

916
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:42,248
Yes, I would love to
do his talk show.

917
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:43,609
I would.

918
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,851
I would love to change
my plans and stay.

919
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,700
... American movie star ...

920
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:15,671
Ladies and gentlemen,

921
01:18:15,671 --> 01:18:18,941
Mr. Bob Harris!

922
01:18:18,941 --> 01:18:22,211
Come on!
Da de da de, da de da dah.

923
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:26,181
Da de da dah! Whoo!

924
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:28,150
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.

925
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:30,527
Bobby, come on!
Bobby, come on!

926
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,456
Nice to meet you.

927
01:18:37,293 --> 01:18:39,705
He said you guys
are e-mailing together.

928
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:48,871
He wants to show you his dance.

929
01:18:48,871 --> 01:18:51,373
Japanese dance step.
Japanese dance.

930
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:53,075
Do I ... Do I have
to dance with him?

931
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:58,180
To-tung a-tung.
To-tung a-tung.

932
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:01,217
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby ... Bobby.

933
01:19:02,585 --> 01:19:04,053
- Welcome, Bob.
- What?

934
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:05,463
He was saying, "Welcome, Bob."

935
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:47,239
- Hello?
~ Bob? ~

936
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:50,602
Hi, Lydia.

937
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,504
~ Is this a bad time? ~

938
01:19:53,536 --> 01:19:55,379
No, it's always a good time.

939
01:19:55,938 --> 01:19:59,275
~ Look, your burgundy carpet
isn't in stock. ~

940
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:02,745
~ It's gonna take 12 weeks. Did you
like any of the other colors? ~

941
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:09,324
Whatever you like.
I'm completely lost.

942
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:12,291
~ It's just carpet. ~

943
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:15,157
That's not what I'm talking about.

944
01:20:15,157 --> 01:20:16,966
~ What are you talking about? ~

945
01:20:19,762 --> 01:20:22,298
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.

946
01:20:22,298 --> 01:20:25,005
You know, I want to take
better care of myself.

947
01:20:25,401 --> 01:20:28,404
I would like to start
eating healthier.

948
01:20:28,571 --> 01:20:30,414
I don't want all that pasta.

949
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:32,044
~ What? ~

950
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,385
I would like to start eating,
like, Japanese food.

951
01:20:36,745 --> 01:20:40,420
~ Well, why don't you just stay there,
and you can have it every day? ~

952
01:20:45,321 --> 01:20:47,061
How are the kids doing?

953
01:20:48,057 --> 01:20:50,696
~ They're fine.
They miss their father. ~

954
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:53,567
~ But they're getting used
to you not being here. ~

955
01:20:53,963 --> 01:20:56,102
~ Do I need to worry
about you, Bob? ~

956
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:59,605
Only if you want to.

957
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:05,283
~ Bob, I got things to do.
I gotta go. ~

958
01:21:05,975 --> 01:21:07,112
Okay.

959
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:10,613
~ I'll see you ... I mean,
I'll talk to you later. ~

960
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:11,921
Okay.

961
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,927
~ Okay, bye. ~

962
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:15,690
Bye.

963
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:58,734
We have Matthew Smellick!

964
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:02,039
Matthew Snellick.

965
01:22:09,371 --> 01:22:10,940
Thank you. Thank you so much.

966
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,141
We'll take a really short break,

967
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:13,676
and we'll see you in a minute.

968

growing up in the '50s.

1004
01:24:43,826 --> 01:24:46,361

Have a nice flight.

1034
01:29:32,447 --> 01:29:34,893
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1035
01:29:36,685 --> 01:29:38,164
I'll be one minute.

1036
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:51,972
Charlotte, I'm down in the lobby,
and I'm leaving now.

1037
01:29:53,668 --> 01:29:55,103
I was calling ...

1038
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:57,276
to see if you still have my jacket.

1039
01:29:57,606 --> 01:29:59,674
If you could bring it down,
but you're not there,

1040
01:29:59,674 --> 01:30:03,178
so this is goodbye, and ...

1041
01:30:05,647 --> 01:30:07,126
So,

1042
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:11,820
I guess, goodbye and enjoy
my jacket which you stole ...

1043
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,060
from me.

1044
01:30:21,263 --> 01:30:22,831
- Hello.
- Hello.

1045
01:30:22,831 --> 01:30:24,179
How are you?

1046
01:30:24,299 --> 01:30:25,505
- I'm good.
- How are you?

1047
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:28,272
Mr. Harris, thank you for coming.

1048
01:30:28,904 --> 01:30:31,273
- Enjoy your trip?
- I had a great time.

1049
01:30:31,273 --> 01:30:32,911
I had a very good time.

1050
01:30:35,343 --> 01:30:37,913
- Excuse me. Aren't you Bob Harris?
- Yes, I am.

1051
01:30:37,913 --> 01:30:41,016
- I'm such a big fan. So nice to meet you.
- Thank you very much. Nice to meet you.

1053
01:30:42,717 --> 01:30:44,052
I have to go right now.

1054
01:30:44,052 --> 01:30:46,293
- Excuse me one second.
- Okay. Well ...

1055
01:30:46,721 --> 01:30:47,927
- Hi.
- Hi.

1056
01:30:48,223 --> 01:30:49,991

1057
01:30:49,991 --> 01:30:51,159
