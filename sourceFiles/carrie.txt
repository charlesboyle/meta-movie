1
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,847
Help.

2
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,124
Help me!

3
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,649
Help me, Lord.

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,525
I'm dying.

5
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,725
What is this?

6
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,361
Cancer?

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,480
Mother Mary, full of
grace, protect me

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,528
and guide me in
my hour of death.

9
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,130
It's a test.

10
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,566
Cut it down.

11
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,291
Cut it down.

12
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,200
Shh.

13
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,005
Sue Snell
and Tommy Ross, come on.

14
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,886
Let's go, ladies! In the water!
Caps on, please!

15
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,807
Chris and Sue,
let's go!

16
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,564
I want you to keep it
in the air three times. All right?

17
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,406
We are graduating,
Ms. Desjardin.

18
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,924
Yeah, Sue!

19
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,565
Get that.

20
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,050
Don't be afraid
of the ball, ladies.

21
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,929
All right, here we go.

22
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,125
All right, Carrie White. Let's
get Carrie into the game.

23
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,886
You can't stand on the sidelines
all the time. Come on.

24
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,005
Whoo!

25
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,726
Carrie's serve.

26
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,921
Yeah, Carrie White!

27
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,124
Do it, Carrie!
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,808
Throw it.
Do it. Serve it.

29
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,286
Oh. Ow.

30
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,130
What the hell?

31
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,090
It's so funny,
Chris.

32
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,324
Are you okay?
Yeah.

33
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,645
Oh, my God.

34
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,090
You eat shit.

35
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,685
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

36
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,091
No, he didn't.
You're making it up.

37
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,561
He came up to me and I said, "Well,
you have to extend your hand..."

38
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,130
Now you're lying.

39
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,571
Help! Help! Help me!

40
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,520
Help me.

41
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,808
Get off me, you freak!
Please.

42
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,962
Oh, my God. Look what
you did to my shirt.

43
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,121
Please!

44
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,929
Stop! Stop!
Settle down.

45
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,281
I think I'm bleeding
to death. Please.

46
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,164
Oh, my God.
It's period blood.

47
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,526
I'm bleeding.
I think I'm dying.

48
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,602
What? Oh, my God.

49
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,604
Please help me!

50
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,489
It's just your period.

51
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,451
Just plug it up.

52
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,489
Help me!
Oh, God!

53
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,802
Oh! She got you.
Help me!

54
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,323
God, just plug it up!

55
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,720
Help!

56
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,602
Plug it up!

57
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,121
I'm sorry. No!

58
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,646
No!

59
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,329
Plug it up!

60
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,848
Girls, come on!
Move!

61
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,161
Ladies.

62
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,329
Oh, my God. Okay. All right.
Help me.

63
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,642
Okay, honey, stand up.
Let's get you cleaned up.

64
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,847
Help me, help me.

65
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,126
Oh, Carrie, come on.

66
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,691
Stand up.
Come on, can you stand up?

67
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,364
It hurts! It hurts!

68
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,967
It hurts! Something's not right.
Something's not right.

69
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,441
Okay, okay. What are
you talking about?

70
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,489
Ms. Desjardin, I don't think
she knows it's her period.

71
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,090
No!

72
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,686
All right, Sue. Get out of here!
You're not helping.

73
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,286
No! No!
Calm down!

74
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,640
Everyone get out!
Now! Out!

75
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,520
Okay, deep breaths.
Come here.

76
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,045
Come on. It's okay.
You're okay, sweetie.

77
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,124
It's totally normal.

78
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,446
Shh.

79
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,405
Do you know
what it means?

80
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,326
Okay, sweetie.

81
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,569
Are you, uh,
feeling better?

82
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,371
Can I get you
some aspirin?

83
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,888
Some juice or something?

84
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,200
Juice?
Really, Henry?

85
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,762
Maybe you just
want us to leave you alone.

86
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,331
Carrie, honey, I am so
sorry that I slapped you.

87
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,843
I should have
handled it better.

88
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,167
It's totally normal for young
girls to get their periods.

89
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,891
It usually actually happens
a little bit earlier.

90
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,403
Is this your first time?

91
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,842
Honey, do you understand
what's happening to your body?

92
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,246
Do you know
what it means?

93
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,446
What?

94
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,041
I don't know. I felt
something moving down there.

95
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,531
Oh, honey.
Whoa!

96
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,241
Maybe you could, uh, talk
to a counselor about that

97
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,084
or a nurse.

98
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,411
Um, what I need to know
is who started throwing...

99
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,361
...things.

100
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,887
It was Chris Hargensen
and all of her friends.

101
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,087
Cassie...
"Carrie."

102
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,085
Carrie, did Chris
Hargensen start this?

103
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,011
Honey, you don't
have to protect them.

104
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,923
What they did
was unforgiveable.

105
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,646
Okay, uh...

106
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,042
It doesn't seem that Carrie
is going to point the finger,

107
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,607
so Ms. Desjardin, I need you
to get to the bottom of this.

108
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,206
Let the punishment
fit the crime.

109
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,281
Okay.

110
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,168
Carrie, you're excused from P.E.
class for the rest of the week.

111
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,527
Just take study hall, okay?
At the library.

112
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,602
Yeah. We're going
to have to call your mom.

113
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,441
What?

114
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,287
We're going to have to
call your mother, Carrie.

115
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,527
I know she's had problems
with us in the past,

116
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,211
ever since the state
stopped her from

117
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,850
homeschooling you anymore,

118
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,048
but we've got to bring
her into this, okay?

119
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,121
Mmm-mmm. No.

120
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,725
Sweetie, we have
no choice.

121
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,370
We have to tell your
mom what happened. No.

122
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,521
Carrie.

123
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,051
Hey. Hey, you.

124
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,651
Tina, give it to me.
Give it here.

125
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,768
This is brilliant.
Look at this video.

126
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,242
<i>Plug it up!</i>

127
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,601
She got her period. On my hand.

128
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,724
That is so disgusting.

129
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,889
It was on my hand and Sue's shirt.
It was so disgusting.

130
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,646
Mmm.

131
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,561
I'm sorry you had to come
to school today, Mom.

132
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,683
Let's go inside,
little girl.

133
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,485
You need to come
inside with me.

134
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,850
Mama, why didn't
you tell me?

135
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,651
I was so scared, Mama. I
thought I was going to die.

136
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,371
Mama, they laughed at me
and they threw things at me.

137
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,043
We'll talk about
this inside, Carrie.

138
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,087
No.

139
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,525
I want to talk
about it right here.

140
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,250
I don't want to
go inside with you.

141
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,883
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie!

142
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,569
Crazy Carrie,
Crazy Carrie.

143
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,486
Oh, Lord,
help my child.

144
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,131
She's lost.

145
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,285
Mama, stop it.

146
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,686
Mama!

147
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,923
I don't want
to upset you.

148
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,484
So, you're a woman now.

149
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,371
And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam.

150
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,681
And what, Carrie? Say it.
No, Mama.

151
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,444
Say it.
Talk to me.

152
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,841
Please just talk to me.
And Eve was weak.

153
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,684
I just want you
to talk to me.

154
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,806
And the first sin was
the sin of intercourse.

155
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,440
Why didn't you
tell me, Mama?

156
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,404
And God visited
Eve with a curse.

157
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,130
And the curse was
a curse of blood.

158
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,565
I'm not going
to say that.

159
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,768
That's not even in the Bible.
It doesn't say that anywhere.

160
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,810
Oh, Lord. Help this little girl
see the sin of her days and ways.

161
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,961
Show her if she had
remained innocent,

162
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,088
the curse of blood would not have
come upon her as it did on Eve.

163
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,686
I'm not Eve, Mama.
I didn't sin.

164
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,207
You showered with
those other girls.

165
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,486
You had
lust-filled thoughts.

166
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,530
Everyone has to shower, Mama. Everyone.
That's just the rules.

167
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,648
You must be different,
because He can see you.

168
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,643
I don't want to be different, Mama.
I want to be like them.

169
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,210
He can smell
the sin on you.

170
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,009
And He will punish you.

171
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,560
I will not let that come down upon you.
I will not.

172
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,005
Lord have mercy.

173
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,209
No. "The Lord is good. His
unfailing love endures forever,

174
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,762
"and his faithfulness continues
through all generations."

175
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,921
Psalms 100, verse 5.

176
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,047
I'm going to keep you
away from that school.

177
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,646
You can't. We'll pray.
We'll pray together.

178
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,644
To save our women-weak,
wicked, sinning souls.

179
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,007
You didn't tell me
and they laughed.

180
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,208
I didn't sin,
you sinned.

181
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,930
I did not.

182
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,450
I did not sin.

183
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,210
Go to your closet.

184
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,561
No, Mama.

185
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,165
Go to your closet
and pray.

186
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,520
You pray.

187
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,041
No.

188
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,566
No!

189
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,721
No!

190
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,610
Get off me! Mama! Stop it!

191
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,410
Go to your closet and
pray for forgiveness.

192
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:29,867
No!

193
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,649
You pray.
Mama! Help!

194
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,288
No, Mommy!
Come on.

195
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,930
Please! Help!

196
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,250
You pray, little girl.
Pray for forgiveness.

197
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,731
Mommy, let me go!

198
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,366
Let me out!

199
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,566
Mom!

200
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,125
God, you suck!

201
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,608
Help me. Help me.

202
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,966
What?

203
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,842
I'm sorry.
What?

204
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,004
Hey. What's wrong?

205
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,201
I really messed
up today, Tommy.

206
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,008
What, that thing
with Carrie?

207
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,445
You know about that?

208
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,848
Yeah, everyone
knows about it,

209
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,685
but you're not responsible
for what Chris does.

210
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,361
Yeah, but it
was me, too.

211
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,763
You threw tampons
at Carrie White?

212
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,202
I kicked a kid
in the ribs once.

213
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,404
Yeah, while he
was knocked out.

214
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,970
Because this kid,

215
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,805
he used to beat the living shit out
of me every day in sixth grade.

216
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,484
Danny Patrick.

217
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,003
Did you apologize
to Carrie?

218
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,242
Did you apologize
to Danny Patrick?

219
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,561
No, but we're not in
sixth grade anymore.

220
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,405
Don't.

221
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,569
He was a dick to me.

222
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,521
What did Carrie White
ever do to you?

223
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,726
Whoo!

224
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,845
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why he lost his license.

225
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,804
Then why
are you still driving?

226
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,764
I don't need a license
if they can't catch me.

227
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,929
Jackie's email,
Jackie's email!

228
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,806
Chris no. No!

229
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,930
Wow. Why don't you two kiss or
something while you're at it?

230
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,365
Oh, baby.

231
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,845
Don't be stupid.

232
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,721
Wait.

233
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,048
Do you think we're going to get
detention because of that?

234
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,208
Because that would suck.
No.

235
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,489
They should be thanking us for helping
her through her first period.

236
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,562
I got her a tampon.
So what?

237
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,563
You were only trying
to help her, right?

238
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,210
We should post it.

239
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,405
No, I'm in it.

240
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,442
No one's going to
see you, Teenie.

241
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,531
What?
What are you doing?

242
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,290
Carrie White.

243
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,840
Favorite movie?

244
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,967
<i>Bloodsport.</i>

245
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,763
Favorite drink?

246
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,250
Bloody Mary.

247
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,447
<i>Brightly beams</i>

248
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,410
<i>Our Father's mercy</i>

249
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,567
<i>From His
lighthouse evermore</i>

250
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,291
<i>But to us
He gives the keeping</i>

251
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,887
<i>Of the lights
along the shore</i>

252
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,369
<i>Let the lower
lights be burning</i>

253
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,964
Did you finish
your prayers, little girl?

254
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,005
Yes, Mama.

255
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,083
That's my good girl.

256
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,490
I love you.

257
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,050
I love you,
too, Mama.

258
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,288
All right, stand up.

259
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,370
Line up, please.

260
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,971
You have a big week coming up.
A big month, actually.

261
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,648
Probably the biggest month of your lives.
Prom and then graduation.

262
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,250
Are you excited?

263
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,242
You probably all
have your dresses.

264
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,763
You have
your dates by now.

265
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,324
What about you, Chris?

266
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,050
Who's the lucky guy?

267
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,770
Billy Nolan.
You don't know him.

268
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,001
He doesn't go
to this school.

269
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,560
Are you going to
get him a boutonniere?

270
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,007
Or are you just going to pin a
bloody tampon to his lapel?

271
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,244
I so don't need
to hear this.

272
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,685
You're not going anywhere.

273
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,369
What about you, Sue?

274
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,048
Are you and Tommy busy campaigning
to be Prom King and Queen?

275
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,043
I would have
voted for you.

276
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,411
Not now.

277
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,167
You all did a shitty
thing yesterday.

278
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,968
A really shitty thing.

279
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,644
And one of you had the
audacity to post a video.

280
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,368
Somebody made
a video of it?

281
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,965
This is bullshit.

282
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,203
That's it. Thanks to Miss Hargensen,
you're all running suicides.

283
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,611
I'm not doing it.

284
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,406
That's up to you.

285
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,648
That's up to all of you, but anyone
who stops running is suspended.

286
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,724
And if you're suspended,
you're not going to prom.

287
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,803
While you're running, I'd like
for you to think long and hard

288
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,850
about what it would be
like to be Carrie White.

289
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,721
I'll be okay, Mama.

290
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,121
I'm going to leave work early today
and pick you up after school.

291
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,684
She can't do
this to me.

292
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,842
Just let it go, Chris.
We're almost done.

293
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,410
Then every day
this week?

294
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,448
All because
of Carrie White?

295
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,169
Like hell I Will.

296
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,969
Keep moving, Hargensen.

297
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,042
Keep running or
you're not going to prom.

298
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,451
Fuck you!

299
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,321
This is child abuse.

300
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,401
What did you say to me?

301
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,531
I'm not going to run
another goddamn inch

302
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,210
because Carrie White
got her period

303
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,284
and was too stupid
to know what it was.

304
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,442
- What?
- You're suspended.

305
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,603
You're out of prom and
you're out of my class. Now.

306
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,125
No.
No?

307
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,965
You can't decide that.
She can't do this to us.

308
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,725
Goodbye, Chris. The rest
of you, keep at it.

309
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,040
Someone could die
of dehydration.

310
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,162
Tina, you have
a heart condition, right?

311
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,608
If we all stick together, they're
not going to suspend all of us.

312
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,049
They're not going to keep us all from prom.
There would be no prom.

313
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,246
Nik, Lizzy?

314
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,006
Let's go, ladies!

315
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,841
Heather?

316
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,285
This is bullshit! We
didn't do anything wrong.

317
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,010
All right, let's go.

318
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,084
Right, Sue? You're with
me on this, right?

319
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,446
Come on.

320
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,961
Sue.

321
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,041
Come on.

322
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,603
Keep going, ladies.

323
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,284
This isn't over.

324
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,642
This isn't over
by a long shot.

325
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,804
That's Carrie White.

326
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,524
Um, you know... Sorry.

327
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,729
I was just going to say, you can
make it full-screen. Watch.

328
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,486
All right, who's next?

329
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,010
Uh, Carrie. Favorite poem.
Did you bring one?

330
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,607
Yeah.

331
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,762
Why don't you come to
the front of the class

332
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,126
and share it
with us all?

333
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,846
"This unfrequented place
to find some ease

334
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,122
"Ease to the body some,
none to the mind

335
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,366
"Times past, and what once
I was and what am now

336
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,524
"O wherefore was my birth

00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,251
"Twice by an Angel,

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,921

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,041
"...ascended."

340
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,125
Okay, uh, that was, uh...

341
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,483
disturbing.

342
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,609
That is the most
you've said in class all year.

343
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,920
Is there anything
else you'd like to share

344
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,650
or are you done
scaring us for the day?

345
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,404
Asshole.

346
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,927
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.
Did you say something?

347
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,005
I said, "Awesome."

348
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,201
I just thought what
Carrie read was awesome.

349
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,371
Didn't you,
Mr. Ulmann?

350
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,443
All right,
who's next? Uh...

351
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,411
Nicki.

352
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,970
I mean, Lizzy.

353
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,404
Is anyone working?

354
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,925
Excuse me.

355
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,850
ls anybody working?

356
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,645
Oh, Margaret.

357
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,766
I'm sorry to disturb you. I don't
know where Hugo and Gloria...

358
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,604
Can I help you, Mrs. Snell?

359
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,011
Yes, I'm picking up.

360
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,246
Margaret, I want to say
how sorry I am

361
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,402
about what happened
at the school.

362
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,644
There's no excuse for what Sue
did, but she's a good girl.

363
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,121
Are any of those
girls good?

364
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,842
Oh, that is beautiful
work, Margaret.

365
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,406
Thank you.

366
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,649
I love what you've done
with the neckline.

367
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,690
And the stitches.
You can barely see them.

368
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,923
So few people can
sew like this anymore.

369
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,129
I could never do anything
like this myself.

370
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,168
Sue's going
to look beautiful.

371
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,567
I am so excited for her.

372
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,847
I remember my prom.

373
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,810
Anyway,
she's going to love it.

374
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,361
These are Godless times,
Mrs. Snell.

375
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,371
<i>This gym teacher
was running Chrissie</i>

376
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,965
into the ground
and used profanity.

377
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,849
I believe the term
"shitty" was used.

378
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,524
She can't do that.
It's abuse of power.

379
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,405
You're right, Daddy.
That's what she said.

380
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,881
"Shitty."
She's really abusive.

381
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,487
Ms. Desjardin was reprimanded for
what happened in class today.

382
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,642
But you know we've had
a lot of problems

383
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,801
with your daughter
in the past.

384
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,407
And now, with what she did to
her classmate, Carrie White.

385
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,642
The girl was having her...

386
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,210
What your daughter
and her posse...

387
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,681
I'm not going to sit here
and listen to half-truths.

388
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,842
I know my daughter. She
said she didn't do it.

389
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,888
I want her prom
privileges restored.

390
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,681
You can't prove she did
anything, can you?

391
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,450
I believe that there is a
video of the incident.

392
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,687
And I think your
daughter is the one who took it.

393
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,808
I think a video like
that would probably

394
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,325
be pretty damning
to anyone in it

395
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,084
and to the person
who made it.

396
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,924
Don't you,
Mr. Hargensen?

397
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,321
I don't know.
I'm just a gym teacher,

398
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,323
but it seems like
a video like that

399
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,368
would probably affect
college admissions,

400
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,769
possibly a lawsuit,
tons of bad publicity.

401
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,446
I wonder what <i>The Today Show</i>
would do with a video like that.

402
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,524
I think we should just look at
her phone and if it's not there,

403
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,400
I owe you a huge apology and she
should be allowed to go to prom.

404
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,761
Chris.

405
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,325
Chris.

406
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,123
Daddy, I'm not
going to give them my phone.

407
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,690
I have personal
things on here.

408
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,928
Isn't that invasion
of privacy or something?

409
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,043
Chrissie, if you want
to go to prom,

410
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,726
just give them the damn phone
and we can be done with this.

411
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,881
I have to get
back to work.

412
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,041
Dad.

413
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,930
God damn it, just give
them your phone, Chris.

414
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,246
No.

415
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,523
So, I'm officially
out of the prom.

416
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,931
I bet that cocksucker Morton
loses his job, though.

417
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,489
My dad is suing him.

418
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,206
Jesus, Sue, why didn't
you stand up for me?

419
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,848
We could have had
them by the balls.

420
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,409
We deserved it for what
we did to Carrie White.

421
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,250
I thought
I deserved it.

422
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,602
Desjardin was right. We did a
shitty thing for no reason.

423
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,648
Bullshit!

424
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,724
That Carrie goes around saying that
everyone but her and her mother

425
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,201
are going to hell and you
stuck up for her? Come on!

426
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,641
You can be such
a pig sometimes, Chris.

427
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,051
What did Carrie White
ever do to you?

428
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,805
She's been begging for it
since the sixth grade, Sue.

429
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,370
I got to go.

430
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,087
I seem to remember
you were in there

431
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,003
throwing shit
with the rest of us.

432
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,447
What was it that
she was calling her?

433
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,488
"Freak"?
I stopped.

434
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,889
Oh, you stopped?

435
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,889
Yeah.
Why did you keep running?

436
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,201
Hmm?

437
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,289
Why did you keep running, Sue?
Stop it, Chris!

438
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,886
You kept running,
Sue, little Suze,

439
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,645
because you've been
dreaming about senior year

440
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,291
and the perfect boyfriend
and the perfect prom

441
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,010
your whole
goddamned life.

442
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,764
You already booked
the hotel,

443
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,683
already practiced the sounds
you're going to make

444
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,411
when you and Tommy make love.

445
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,123
That's why you had this
bullshit change of heart.

446
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,567
You don't give a shit
about Carrie White.

447
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,924
And everybody knows it.

448
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,369
Okay. I'll see you
around, Sue.

449
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,961
Carrie?

450
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,727
Carrie?

451
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,569
I'm not going to let anyone
hurt you, little girl.

452
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,770
You're safe here with me.

453
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,640
Got it.

454
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,841
Hey.

455
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,209
How are you doing?
Good.

456
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,520
Good?
Yeah.

457
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,000
What's up?

458
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:46,747
I want you to take
Carrie White to prom.

459
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,284
Good one, babe.
Come on.

460
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,246
Are you serious?

461
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,924
I'm just trying
to fix what I did.

462
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,606
Yeah.
I get that, but this is...

463
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,727
Sue, it's nuts.

464
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,086
Okay, so it's nuts.

465
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,607
But after what we did to
her, I have to do something.

466
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,603
I have to do something
that counts.

467
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,966
Uh...

468
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,486
What even makes you
think that she would say yes to me?

469
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,561
She'd say yes.

470
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,244
We've barely even spoken.

471
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,005
I saw how she looked at you in
class when you rescued her.

472
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,162
What girl doesn't
want to go to prom?

473
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,481
What girl doesn't
want one magical night?

474
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,530
Maybe I can give
that up for her.

475
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,171
No. Babe, I want you
to have that magic night.

476
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,964
I don't want to go to prom
with Carrie White.

477
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,451
I want to go
to prom with you.

478
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,525
I can't go.

479
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,811
Hey, Carrie.

480
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,120
I was looking for you
at the library

481
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,406
because that's where
they said you were.

482
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,848
But, uh, you weren't there, so
I figured maybe you were here.

483
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,167
<i>"Telekinesis:
Unlocking the Mind."</i>

484
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,369
No, no.
Is that about, uh, hypnosis?

485
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,449
Because me and my friends,
we tried that.

486
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,807
We actually hypnotized
my boy's dog.

487
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,401
Anyway, um...

488
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,011
How are you doing?

489
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,526
I'm okay.

490
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,321
Cool.

491
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,802
So you know how, um,
prom is next week?

492
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,086
You know?

493
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,329
Um, I was wondering, if you don't have a
date already, maybe you want to go with me.

494
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,201
What?

495
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,681
The prom.
Next week.

496
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,001
Carrie.

497
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,721
Hey.

498
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,324
Carrie.
Stop!

499
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,251
Please, just stop
trying to trick me.

500
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,846
No, I'm not trying to trick you.
I'm not tricking you.

501
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,286
Aren't you
with Sue Snell?

502
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,250
Yeah, I'm with Sue Snell,
but she doesn't want to go.

503
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,006
I'm sorry.

504
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,848
Did one of the girls
try something again?

505
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,841
No.

506
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,563
I got invited to prom.

507
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,561
Really?

508
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,525
That's great news.

509
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,531
With who?

510
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,164
It's Tommy Ross.

511
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,801
Wow. Tommy Ross?

512
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,486
He is pretty dreamy, huh?

513
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,001
Yeah.

514
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,762
I know who he
goes around with.

515
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,968
They're just going
to trick me again.

516
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,166
Right?

517
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,243
Maybe he really meant it.

518
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,161
No.

519
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,283
Yes, of course he did.

520
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,521
Why?

521
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,728
Why would he
want to go with me?

522
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,641
Come here.

523
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,964
Do you know
what I see?

524
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,763
I see a beautiful
young woman.

525
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,963
Maybe wear
a little make-up.

526
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,963
Pinch your cheeks
a little bit,

527
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,929
put some color in there.

528
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,050
Curl your hair.

529
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,124
Stand up straight.

530
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,370
There you go.

531
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,370
Come on, Sue.

532
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,488
You and Chris are best friends.
If you two...

533
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,728
If you three are planning
on playing a joke

534
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,848
on a lonely,
defenseless girl...

535
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,331
This has nothing
to do with Chris.

536
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,966
Or you, Miss Desjardin.
And for me...

537
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,207
Listen, with due respect, Miss
Desjardin, this is between Sue and me.

538
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,721
It's kind of like
a private thing.

539
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,643
And what is
the big deal anyway?

540
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,960
It's just for
one night, right?

541
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,840
Famous athletes
like Tim Tebow,

542
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,402
he takes kids to prom all the time
and everyone loves him for it.

543
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,246
Really?

544
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,770
You're hardly
a famous athlete.

545
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,291
This is a really big deal for her.

546
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,566
Listen.
It doesn't matter.

547
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,565
She said no.

548
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,563
So you'll try again.
Don't.

549
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,920
Okay.
It's not okay.

550
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,327
Tommy,

551
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,284
when you show up to prom with
Carrie White on your arm,

552
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,443
don't you think you're going to
look the tiniest bit ridiculous?

553
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,807
We don't care how we look.
Do we?

554
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,321
No.

555
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,126
Come on.

556
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,726
What are you doing here?

557
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,325
Aren't you
going to ask me in?

558
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,402
What do you want?
You can't be here.

559
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,211
Right to the point, huh?
Cool. About the prom.

560
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,286
You kind of
left me hanging.

561
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,885
I already told you.

562
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,486
I know, but I was hoping
that you'd change your mind.

563
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,163
Girls change their
mind all the time.

564
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,366
Why are you doing this?

565
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,805
Because I want to.

566
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,164
You need to leave.

567
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,043
I'm not leaving
until you say yes.

568
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,930
Why is this so
important to you?

569
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,162
Because I think that we
would have a good time.

570
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,568
And because I think that what
you read in class was cool.

571
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,321
I looked up that book
in the library myself.

572
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,691
That's the guy who brought the
temple down. Samson, right?

573
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,241
Yes.

574
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,603
Yes, okay, I'll go.

575
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,444
I have to be back
by 10:30.

576
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,571
Sure, okay. Um...

577
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,808
I'll pick you up
here at 7:00?

578
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,361
Okay.

579
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,966
Crazy, right?
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.

580
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,367
Where have you been? I was worried sick.
Come on. Come inside.

581
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,284
I'm sorry I'm late, Mama.
Just get inside.

582
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,567
Your supper's cold. I'm going
to have to heat it up.

583
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,051
I didn't know...

584
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,731
You're immodest.

585
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,325
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know.

586
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,890
No, Mama. I took a
bus to Main Street

587
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,371
and I bought cloth
for a dress.

588
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,760
You are not to go anywhere but to
school and back. You know that.

589
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,605
Mama, before you say anything
else, I've been asked to prom.

590
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,811
Mama, I've been
asked to prom.

591
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,484
Oh, God, why?

592
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,211
It's next Saturday and
he's a very nice boy.

593
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,247
And he'll come and
meet you before

594
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,084
and he promised to
have me home by 10:30.

595
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,720
No, no, no.
I already accepted.

596
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,084
I know this scares you.

597
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,605
It scares me, too.

598
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,761
The other kids,

599
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,884
they think I'm weird.

600
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,090
But I don't want to be.

601
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,444
I have to try to be
a whole person.

602
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,884
Before it's too late.

603
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,205
He'll hurt you.

604
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,970
No, Mama.

605
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,361
No, Mama, there are bad
people, but not Tommy.

606
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,681
He's good. You'll like him.
He's a very nice boy.

607
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,001
Boys, boys.
After the blood,

608
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,004
comes the boys sniffing,
slobbering like dogs.

609
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,366
Stop it, Mama.

610
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,171
He's going to paw at you until he finds
where that blood smell comes from.

611
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,446
He's going to
take you, Carrie,

612
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,646
in his car out
to the wilderness,

613
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,848
out where it's cold and the
roadhouses are and the whiskey.

614
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,126
Stop being so crazy.

615
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,440
You tell that boy
you're not going.

616
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,567
No.

617
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,563
We'll move from here. We're
never going to stop moving.

618
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,444
You're going to go to your
closet and you're going to pray.

619
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,807
You're going to get in there and
you're going to pray for forgiveness.

620
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,291
No, never again, Mama!

621
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,965
Mama, stand up.

622
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,131
Mama, stand up!

623
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,040
Mama, I'm going.

624
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,411
Witch.
I'm not a witch, Mama.

625
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,681
There are no witches.

626
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,808
The devil's got her now.
Like he did before.

627
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,850
It's not the devil, Mama. There are
other people out there like me

628
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,921
who can do
what I can do.

629
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,850
You poor child. Don't you know
he's working through you?

630
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,167
Mama, it's inherited. it was
passed down from Grandma

631
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,480
and it skipped you.

632
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,928
You know that.
Maybe it came from Daddy.

633
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,446
He gave me a cancer.
I thought you were cancer.

634
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,849
That's awful. Don't say that.
She's lost to me.

635
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,321
Pray all you want, Mama,
but I'm going.

636
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,449
And nothing's going
to stop me.

637
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,728
And I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

638
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,090
What are we doing?

639
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,367
What does this have to do
with Carrie White?

640
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,809
Baby, you said you wanted us
to do something about her.

641
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,891
It's a piggy!

642
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,043
Here, piggy, piggy.

643
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,722
Here, piggy, piggy.

644
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,131
It smells
like shit in here.

645
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,203
Chris, pick one. Pick one
that looks like her.

646
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,609
Pig's blood for a pig.

647
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,520
That one.

648
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,801
Go on.

649
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,281
One quick swing,
all right?

650
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,811
I got this.

651
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,526
Don't worry,
little piggy,

652
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,807
Uncle Jack is going
to bash your head right in.

653
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,766
You're not going
to feel one...

654
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,729
Shut up!
Do it already. Jesus.

655
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,286
I can't.

656
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,648
God, you guys are
such goddamn pussies.

657
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,881
Shut up!

658
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,646
I'm sorry, Billy.

659
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,485
Come on, you got this.

660
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,762
All right, it's just
one quick slice and...

661
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,366
Oh, my God.

662
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,281
Good job, baby.

663
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,007
Sue.
Hey, are you okay?

664
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,891
There we go.

665
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,767
Billy. Hurry up.

666
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,730
Oh, my God.

667
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,963
When the time comes, I'll let
you pull the rope, okay?

668
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,371
Oh, I plan on it.

669
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,171
Did you guys
see Sue today?

670
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,089
She looked awful.

671
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,520
I know Chris isn't coming.

672
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,761
She's suspended.

673
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,001
Do you think she'll crash?

674
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,360
You never know
with Chris, right?

675
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,444
So, I think I'm going
to have the after-party.

676
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,201
No.

677
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,609
What do you think?
Down?

678
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,801
No.

679
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,247
Yeah.

680
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,281
Whoo!

681
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,405
Will you pin it
on me, Mama?

682
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,041
Red.

683
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,011
I might have known
it would be red.

684
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,320
It's pink.

685
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,889
I can see your dirty pillows.
Everyone will.

686
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,486
Breasts, Mama.

687
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,401
Breasts. You have them
and every woman has them.

688
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,603
Take off
that dress, Carrie.

689
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,521
No.

690
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,411
Take it off and we'll burn it
together and pray for forgiveness.

691
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,925
Mama, it's modest.

692
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,843
Call that boy and tell
him you're not going.

693
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,366
You just tell him
you're sick.

694
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,771
I don't want you
to get hurt.

695
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,047
Or you could just
be happy for me.

696
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,204
Mama, stop hurting yourself.

697
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,728
You know it's not going
to make me stay.

698
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,081
He's not coming.
It's a trick.

699
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,484
Same as always.

700
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,370
He's going to come.

701
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,805
They're going
to laugh at you.

702
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,166
They're all going
to laugh at you.

703
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,242
Mama, stop it.

704
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,084
I'm nervous enough
as it is.

705
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,201
Thank you, sir.

706
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,489
You see, Mama?

707
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,011
You see, it's all
going to be okay.

708
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,686
Oh, repent.
It's not too late.

709
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,048
Mama, don't ruin this for me.
I'll be home early.

710
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,600
I'm going to have to
tell that boy the truth

711
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,045
that your father took me
and you were born of sin.

712
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,690
You'll say nothing, Mama.
And from that sin...

713
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,766
From that sin
was born another.

714
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,171
The worst sin.

715
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,890
"A man or a woman
who is a witch

716
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,450
"among you is to
be put to death.

717
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,681
"You are to stone them."

718
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,284
I'm warning you, Mama.

719
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,600
The devil's hand.

720
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,125
Please don't do this.

721
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,368
There will be
a judgment, Carrie.

722
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,046
As Jezebel fell from
the tower, you too...

723
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,645
Mama, you're not going to say
another word until I'm gone.

724
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,890
Mommy, I'm sorry.

725
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,485
I love you.

726
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,170
I'll be home early.

727
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,241
Hi.

728
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,041
Hi.

729
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,204
Do I look okay?

730
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,805
You look beautiful.

731
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,843
Tommy, can we
wait a minute?

732
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,842
Yeah, sure, we can wait
as long as you want.

733
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,005
Are you scared?

734
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,250
They're not that bad.

735
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,364
Besides, I need you
in there.

736
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,284
Dancing by myself all night,
I'd look awful silly.

737
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,324
Here, let me fix this.

738
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,208
I think this is supposed
to go on your wrist.

739
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,961
There.

740
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,806
Are you ready?

741
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,120
God, you look
handsome, Ross.

742
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,328
Dawson!

743
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,402
Don't worry. If they kill each
other, I'll dance with you.

744
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,404
Carrie, this is my best
buddy, George Dawson.

745
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,450
And this is his girlfriend, Erika.
She goes to Dover.

746
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,521
Hi.

747
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,611
Come on, I'll show
you the table.

748
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,648
I love your dress.
Where did you get it?

749
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,051
I made it.

750
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,610
No kidding. Really?

751
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,250
Yeah.
That's amazing.

752
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,166
Do you want
to dance?

753
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,524
Or, if you want, we could
wait for a slower song.

754
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,201
Yeah.

755
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,646
I'll be back.

756
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,369
Miss Desjardin.

757
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,201
You look beautiful.

758
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,124
I'll let you two ladies talk.

759
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,487
Uh, do you want
some punch?

760
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,528
I heard Greg
and Harry spiked it.

761
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,761
Really?

762
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,324
No, I'm just kidding.

763
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,327
You're doing okay?

764
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,164
Yeah.
Yeah?

765
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,807
Listen.

766
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,122
Do you really have
to be home so early?

767
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,726
I promised.

768
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,689
Yeah, I know.
I understand.

769
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,526
But, um, a bunch of people, we're
going to the Cavalier after.

770
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,682
That's okay.
What is?

771
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,006
I know you want to hang out with
your friends, and that's...

772
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,047
No.

773
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,530
It's a slow song.

774
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,601
No.

775
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,167
Yeah. Come on.

776
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,242
No, Tommy.
I've never danced before.

777
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,886
It's okay. No, I can't.
I can't do it.

778
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,770
You can't go to prom and not
have at least one dance.

779
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,887
I can't.

780
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,487
Carrie White, will you
have this dance with me?

781
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,686
Come on.

782
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,926
Come on.

783
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,085
It's so easy. Take this hand in my hand.
Like this, see?

784
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,971
You're going to put this
hand on my shoulder.

785
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,485
And I put my hand
on your hip.

786
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,011
Then we sway.

787
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,171
See, it's easy.

788
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,923
You've got nothing
to worry about.

789
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,729
And you're good,
you're a good learner.

790
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,567
And then, if you want
to get fancy with it,

791
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,688
we can do the
<i>Dancing With The Stars.</i>

792
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,171
Yeah.
No.

793
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,885
Yeah. Ready? Look.

794
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,884
To the first one.

795
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,565
This is fun, right?

796
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,011
Tommy, why am I here?

797
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,128
Because I invited you.

798
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,406
But why?

799
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,970
Carrie, we're here.

800
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,891
We're at prom. I'm having
such a great time with you.

801
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,241
You are?

802
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,401
Yeah.

803
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,920
And I hope that you're
having a good time with me.

804
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,401
Yeah.

805
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,083
So, what do you say
we dance a little longer,

806
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,204
and then we see which poor fool
they crown King and Queen,

807
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,931
and then we go to the Cavalier?

808
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,645
And I'll have you home by 10:30.
How does that sound to you?

809
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,445
Yeah.
Yeah?

810
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,124
Maybe 11:00.

811
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,446
Whatever you want.

812
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,291
11:00.

813
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,247
<i>All right, everyone,
take your seats. Take your seats.</i>

814
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,766
<i>It's now time to
vote for your King</i>

815
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,003
<i>and Queen of the prom. All right.</i>

816
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,085
<i>Ballots are on the table.
Everyone gets their own, please.</i>

817
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,162
<i>Guys, take your seats.</i>

818
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:56,641
Here.

819
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,371
<i>Make an "X" beside
the candidate of your choice.</i>

820
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,443
<i>Let's have
the best prom ever.</i>

821
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,806
<i>Whoo!</i>

822
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,531
<i>All right.</i>

823
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,331
Tommy, we're on here.

824
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,401
Don't you want
to be on there?

825
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,766
Do you?

826
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,126
Why not?

827
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,850
If we win, the only
thing that happens is

828
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,684
we have to go up there
on those thrones,

829
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,807
wave a scepter around while
they play the school song,

830
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,527
and then, uh, do a little dance so
everyone can see how idiotic we look.

831
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,444
They are beautiful.

832
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,249
You're beautiful.

833
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,371
So, who do we vote for?

834
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,041
I guess they're
more your crowd than mine.

835
01:08:47,067 --> 01:08:48,227
I don't really have a crowd.

836
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,362
Well, I think we vote
for ourselves, right?

837
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,042
No. No,
don't vote for us.

838
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,123
To the devil
with false modesty.

839
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,930
To the devil.

840
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,722
Hurt yourself?
No.

841
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,644
To my boy, George Dawson,
to the Fearsome Four,

842
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,843
Mike, Matt, Brian, and Brad.
I'm going to miss you guys.

843
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,161
- All set?
- Oh, yeah.

844
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,081
Good luck, kids.
You've got my vote.

845
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,160
More ballots for you.

846
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,446
Hey, girl.

847
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,970
Here you go.

848
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,484
As soon as that
bucket goes, we run.

849
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,523
We don't stick around for the
laughs or the screams or anything.

850
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,561
All right?

851
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,200
You got it?

852
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,130
Are you listening? Hey.

853
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,450
What?
When they get up there,

854
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,329
what's happening? You're pulling
the rope and when the...

855
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,721
Shut up so I can hear.
Hey. Listen to me. Listen.

856
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,928
If you get caught and you say
anything about what we did,

857
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,570
I will fucking kill you.

858
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,529
This isn't what you bitches
did in the shower.

859
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,761
This is criminal assault.

860
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,922
This is fucking jail time
if we're caught.

861
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,161
I get it.

862
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,889
Hey. Whatever happens
tonight, you're Queen, okay?

863
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:58,329
And the results are in.
And it was very, very close.

864
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,840
A drum roll, please.

865
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,891
By one vote,
our winners are...

866
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,047
Tommy Ross
and Carrie White!

867
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,406
Come on.

868
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,930
Way to go, Carrie.

869
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,290
Heather, where's Chris?

870
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,442
What are you talking about?
She's not here.

871
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,324
Hey, what's wrong? Come on, go.
You can do this.

872
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,843
We are fucking doing this.
It's too late to go back now.

873
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,650
Ewen High...

874
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,771
I give you your newly crowned
King and Queen of the prom,

875
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,925
Tommy Ross
and Carrie White.

876
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,083
Pull it!
Shut up, Billy!

877
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,691
Chris.
Sue?

878
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,201
Sue.

879
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,089
What are you doing? Come on.
Come on, let's go.

880
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,362
No! Miss Desjardin,
it's not me. It's Chris.

881
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,965
Pull it, Billy, pull it!

882
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,246
Don't ruin this
for Carrie.

883
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,890
It's not me!
Come on. Out.

884
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,641
Let her have this.
No, wait!

885
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,565
What the hell?

886
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,043
<i>Plug it up!</i>

887
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,528
<i>Please help me!</i>

888
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,322
<i>Plug it up!</i>

889
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,923
Carrie, wait.
Carrie.

890
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,125
<i>Help me.</i>

891
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,880
<i>No!</i>

892
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,809
<i>Freak! Freak!
Come on.</i>

893
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,930
Carrie, come on.

894
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,481
Tommy.

895
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,446
Tommy.

896
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,685
Tommy, no.

897
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,161
No.

898
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,684
Fuck.

899
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,646
You have an inch.

900
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,960
Yeah. Come on.

901
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,010
Go, go. Come on.

902
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,528
Come on.
Are you seeing this?

903
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,243
Wait.
Come on.

904
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,606
There's been an explosion.

905
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,406
Don't panic!

906
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,521
Bleachers!

907
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,045
We have to
get to the door.

908
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,321
Nicki!

909
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,688
Lizzy!
Nicki!

910
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,762
- Come on! We got to go!
- Okay.

911
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,006
Tina, come on!

912
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,366
We're all going to die!

913
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,960
Come on!

914
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,805
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

915
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,411
Nothing. Do you think
this is a fucking game?

916
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,845
Shut up.

917
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,644
What are we going to do?

918
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,922
We're going to leave town and
we're never going to come back.

919
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,928
Okay? It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

920
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,121
Okay.

921
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,163
Oh, my God!
Watch out!

922
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,205
Shit town!

923
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,171
Go, move!

924
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,691
Oh, my God.

925
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,325
It's Carrie.

926
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,967
Run her down.

927
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,521
Kill her.

928
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,602
Kill her, Billy.
Kill her, Billy! Kill her!

929
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,966
Shut up! I got this.

930
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,285
Come on!

931
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,006
Billy?

932
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,121
Billy?

933
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,081
Billy?

934
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,726
No.

935
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,851
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

936
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,161
Mama?

937
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:29,966
Mama?

938
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,406
Mama?

939
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,161
Mama!

940
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,887
No.

941
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,126
No.

942
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,041
No.

943
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,045
I'm so sorry.

944
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,086
Mama?

945
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,881
Mama?

946
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,331
Oh, Mama.

947
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,524
Mama, you were right.

948
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,928
They laughed at me, Mommy.

949
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,403
They all laughed at me.

950
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,562
I knew they'd hurt
my little girl.

951
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,401
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

952
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,963
We slept in
the same bed,

953
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,210
lived together sinlessly.

954
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,681
Then one night, I saw him
look at me in that way.

955
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,927
And we got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

956
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,804
And that's when
he took me.

957
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,487
No, Mama.
I don't want to hear it.

958
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,847
And I liked it.
Mama, no.

959
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,561
I should have given you to God
when you were born, but...

960
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,365
I was weak.

961
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,721
And I loved you so much.

962
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,604
And I said, "God,

963
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,721
"let me keep
my little girl.

964
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,884
"Let me keep her."

965
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,166
Let's pray.

966
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:49,691
Yes, Mama.

967
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,725
Yes, we'll pray.

968
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,522
I'll be the preacher.
You'll be my congregation.

969
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,888
"Our Father,
Who art in heaven,

970
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,244
"hallowed be Thy name.

971
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,324
"Thy kingdom come,

972
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,685
"Thy will be done

973
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,565
"on earth

974
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,244
"as it is in heaven."

975
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,246
Mama!

976
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,851
Mama, please.

977
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,683
No, Mama. Mama, please.

978
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,087
This isn't your fault,
Carrie. It's mine.

979
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,004
Mommy, this isn't right.
You know the devil never dies.

980
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,846
He keeps coming back.
You've got to keep killin' him.

981
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,606
No, Mama.
Over and over again.

982
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,603
Mama, please. Mama!

983
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,845
No!

984
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,286
No, Mama.

985
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,885
Mama, stop it!

986
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,322
Carrie.
I'm sorry.

987
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,606
Carrie!

988
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,406
Okay.

989
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,571
It's okay.

990
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,244
It's okay. No one's
going to hurt you.

991
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,608
No one's going to hurt you.

992
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,886
Carrie?

993
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,769
Let me help you,
Carrie.

994
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,202
Why couldn't you
leave me alone?

995
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,486
I'm sorry.

996
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,482
Look what you
turned me into.

997
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,290
Don't hurt me,
Carrie.

998
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,885
Why not?

999
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,444
I've been hurt
my whole life.

1000
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,648
I killed my mom.

1001
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,170
I want her back.

1002
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,210
I'm scared.

1003
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,809
We've got to
get out of here!

1004
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:59,410
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

1005
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,806
Come on!

1006
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,168
It's a girl.
What?

1007
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,731
You don't know?

1008
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,171
Oh, my God.

1009
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,851
Get out!

1010
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,891
Get out!

1011
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,006
It's okay.

1012
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,564
You're doing great.
That's just another contraction.

1013
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,041
Okay.

1014
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,641
Sue, do me
a favor and push.

1015
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,803
No, something doesn't feel right.
It doesn't feel right.

1016
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,360
Come on now, breathe.
Try again, Sue. Try again.

1017
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,726
Everything's okay.

1018
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,084
There we go. Ready?

1019
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,286
It hurts! Please help me!

1020
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,001
Just lay back, okay, Sue?

1021
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,487
There you go.

1022
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,761
Almost there.

1023
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,007
Is it normal?

1024
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,651
All right, just push!
Everything's gonna be okay.

1025
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,926
Hold her still!

1026
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,081
Sue, push!

1027
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,925
Sue, I need you
to breathe!

1028
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,601
Now, get ready
for the next one.

1029
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,485
Push! You can do it!
Come on!

1030
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,761
Wake up, baby!

1031
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,527
It's okay, it's okay.
I gotcha.

1032
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,451
It's over, baby! It's over!

1033
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,045
Sue, you're all right!

1034
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,441
You're all right!

1035
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,281
Baby, wake up!

1036
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,003
<i>I can hardly make you mine</i>

1037
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,524
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>

1038
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:27,041
<i>At the end of a long day
and when I wake</i>

1039
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:32,961
<i>If you could just
give me a sign</i>

1040
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:36,330
<i>We could leave it all behind</i>

1041
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:42,569
<i>Stop taking the long
way before we play</i>

1042
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:50,003
<i>I don't think I can make it
and I know you're the one</i>

1043
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,923
<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>

1044
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,561
<i>Well, I can hardly
make you mine</i>

1045
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,170
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>

1046
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:45,607
<i>But you never wanted,
but you had to take</i>

1047
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:51,247
<i>So I can never give you up</i>

1048
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:55,087
<i>I guess it's 'cause
it's just a crush</i>

1049
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:01,211
<i>Before the end of a long
day and then I wake</i>

1050
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:09,250
<i>But I know you're not
the one or the only</i>

1051
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,124
<i>But we both know what
it's like to be lonely</i>

1052
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,884
<i>Well, these fantasies,
they left us lonely</i>

1053
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,288
<i>Boy, just bring all
your love back to me</i>

1054
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:32,405
<i>I guess for now
this is how it'll be</i>

1055
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,006
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>

1056
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:47,251
<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>

1057
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,408
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>

1058
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,409
<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>
