2
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,378
Hello?

3
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,676
Hello, Admitting.

4
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,344
This is Saperstein.

5
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,592
Where is he?

6
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,384
He's cleared Admitting?

7
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,889
Right.

8
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,846
Bring him in.

9
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,861
He's coming.

10
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,658
Good, good.

11
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,993
Trent?

12
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,708
John J.

13
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,914
Put him in number nine.

14
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,837
You son of a bitch.

15
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,718
You, argh...

16
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,174
- Don't.
- Heh.

17
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,726
- Hang on to him.
- Don't!

18
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,439
No.

19
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,649
- No, no, no.
- Come on. Get him in there.

20
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,856
No, not me!

21
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,820
No, wait, wait.

22
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,949
This is wrong.
Look, I'm sorry about the balls.

23
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,873
It was a lucky shot, that's all.

24
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,916
Wait!

25
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,336
- Thank you.
- Wait!

26
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,971
I'm not insane. You hear me?

27
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,428
I'm not insane!

28
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,387
I'm not if he's not!

29
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,939
Oh, me neither. Me neither.

30
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,062
I'm not insane!

31
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,688
Me neither!

32
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,946
I'm not insane!

33
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,563
Yes, doctor? It worked...

34
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,245
Oh, no.

35
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,000
Not the Carpenters too.

36
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,463
This is a rotten way to end it.

37
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,718
<i>This is not the ending.
You haven't read it yet.</i>

38
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,447
- Yes, just a minute.
- Here you are, doctor.

39
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,248
Thank you.

40
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,039
All right.

41
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,337
- Came in this afternoon?
-Yes.

42
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,039
How did you get here so fast?

43
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,547
We've been monitoring admissions
through police and paramedic channels.

44
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,097
- This one fit the symptoms.
-You think he's one of them?

45
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,801
Mr. Saperstein, I promise you,
that's what I'm here to find out.

46
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,182
Things must be getting pretty bad
out there...

47
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,730
...to bring you fellas in, heh.

48
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,692
- Is this it?
-Yes.

49
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,525
- Did he make any requests?
-Just...

50
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,489
...one.

51
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,819
A, uh, single black crayon.

52
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,515
- John?
-Hang on.

53
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,063
What's up?

54
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,978
My name is Dr. Wrenn.

55
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,192
And I'm going to try
and get you out of here.

56
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,951
After all my redecorating? Heh.

57
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,491
No, I think I'll stay.

58
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,123
There's a guard
with a pair of swollen testicles...

59
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,496
...who swears you wanted out of here.

60
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,080
I, uh... Well...

61
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,460
...I've changed my mind.

62
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,292
I see.

63
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,721
The crosses are a nice touch.

64
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:30,019
They'd almost have to keep you here once
they'd seen these wouldn't they, John?

65
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,395
Got a smoke?

66
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,488
You're waiting to hear about my them,
aren't you?

67
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,782
Your what?

68
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,455
My them.

69
00:08:55,201 --> 00:09:00,048
Oh, every paranoid schizophrenic
has one, a them, a they, an it.

70
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,128
And you wanna hear about my them,
don't you?

71
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,212
I want to know how you got here.

72
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,103
Things are turning to shit out there,
aren't they?

73
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,390
Let's talk about you.

74
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,895
Your dime.

75
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,236
I'm a...

76
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,867
I was an insurance investigator,
freelance.

77
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,746
Checked out funny claims, frauds,
the usual kind of thing.

78
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,080
And lately, I'd been working
for a firm here in the city.

79
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:47,012
And all of this started
with the disappearance.

80
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:52,343
The Sutter Cane disappearance.

81
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,808
It's a little hot in here, isn't it?

82
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,610
It's boiling.

83
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,068
How long I gotta be here?

84
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,159
I mean,
I took care of all that paperwork.

85
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,117
The check was supposed
to be here three weeks ago, right?

86
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,826
Uh, isn't that right?

87
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,334
Usually, that's the way it goes
but I just have a few final questions...

88
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,585
...to ask about the fire.

89
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,288
Pfft, more questions.

90
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,716
I've answered all your questions.
I mean, enough's enough here.

91
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,172
It was supposed to be cut and dried.
They told me.

92
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,758
Look, I understand.
We'll be out of here in a minute.

93
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,719
See, Robby here, he owns the company.

94
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,181
And he's hired me to see
that things go smoothly, you understand?

95
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,310
Oh, it's just a little thing, but, see,
Robby takes the view that it was you...

96
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,939
...who burned down your own warehouse
on Northern Boulevard.

97
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,520
Me? Heh, that's horseshit.

98
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,526
That was my stuff in that warehouse.
That's my whole life.

99
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,238
Believe me, I sympathize.

100
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,433
You're starting to sweat. Shall
I turn on the air conditioning?

101
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,346
What do you think?

102
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,031
- Oh, no, I'm fine.
-You sure?

103
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,331
Yeah. Yeah.

104
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,454
- Okay.
-it's just...

105
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,004
I'm running a little late, that's all.
I'm supposed to pick up my wife.

106
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,416
Oh, yeah, your wife.

107
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,750
She's a great lady.

108
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,801
- You know her?
-No, not really. We just met briefly.

109
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,509
You know, when I went around
to check up on your story.

110
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,599
See, we have these photographs...

111
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,514
...of your wife tooling around town...

112
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,819
...wearing various articles that you
claim were destroyed in the fire.

113
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,647
No, that's, heh, impossible.

114
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,945
No, this is all stuff
I bought for her myself.

115
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,994
See, the problem is,
when I went around to talk to her...

116
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,123
...it turned out she knew a lot more
than she thought she did.

117
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,125
Especially...

118
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:49,342
Especially after I showed her pictures
of Miss Palminteri...

119
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,842
...who appears to be wearing
even more of your destroyed articles.

120
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,016
Miss Palminteri?

121
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,767
Miss Rosa Palminteri.

122
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,144
A word of advice.

123
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,226
You wanna pull a scam...

124
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,645
...don't make your wife a partner.

125
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,821
And if you do...

126
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,451
...don't fuck around behind her back.

127
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,863
Trent, you look beautiful.

128
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,918
Everybody says you got the best nose
for a con in the business.

129
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:27,206
But to see it firsthand--
I mean, to watch you work is incredible.

130
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,213
Well, it wasn't hard, Robby.
The guy's wife liked me.

131
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,717
Besides, he was an amateur.
It's just too easy with amateurs.

132
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,390
Try to figure out who's professional
and who isn't.

133
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,936
And that's when it gets fun,
when you run into a pro.

134
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,566
Most of my salesmen couldn't sniff out
a phony claim...

135
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,192
...if their noses were nailed to it,
but you, man, you never miss.

136
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,318
What's to miss?

137
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:54,846
You learn to expect the worst
in people and you get it.

138
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,573
Everyone's looking to play an angle.

139
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,030
I'm always there to clean up the mess.

140
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,911
I'll tell you what.

141
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,664
You stop freelancing, join my staff.

142
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,744
I'll make it worth your while, Trent.

143
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,622
Forget it, Robby.

144
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,333
I'm my own man.
Nobody pulls my strings.

145
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,838
I'm independent. I'm happy.

146
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,589
Well, be my man one more time.

147
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,094
I'm having quite a difficult mess
with Arcane.

148
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,427
- The publishing house?
-Yeah, it's my biggest account.

149
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,059
They just filed a claim
that cost me millions.

150
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,311
I want you on this right away.

151
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,359
- What's the claim?
-Sutter Cane is missing.

152
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,188
- Who?
-Sutter Cane.

153
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,340
- Do you read Sutter Cane?
-What?

154
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,803
Lay down! Lay down! Lay down!

155
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,984
<i>Horror writer Sutter Cane...</i>

156
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,153
<i>...a harmless pop phenomenon...</i>

157
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,912
<i>...or a deadly mad prophet
of the printed page?</i>

158
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,164
<i>This was the scene today
outside several city bookstores.</i>

159
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:33,465
<i>Police believe the riots began because
the stores could not meet the demand...</i>

<i>...for advance orders

<i>When does fiction become religion?</i>

163
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,262
<i>And are his fans dangerous?</i>

164
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,763
Only if you count axes.

165

166
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,014

167
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,070
Mr. Trent?

168
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,656
Mr. Trent?

169
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,496
Mr. Harglow will see you now.

170
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,323
Thank you.

171
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,831
You're not listening.
I needed it yesterday.

172
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:15,211
If you wait any longer, it'll be all
over the front page. Get it done.

173
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,126
Jackson Harglow, Mr. Trent.
I'm pleased to meet you.

174
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,462
- It's a pleasure.
- Excuse the commotion.

175
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,049
We have something of a crisis going on.

176
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,602
Now, everybody out now, please.
I need time with Mr. Trent.

177
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,975
Have Sylvia hold the calls,
and get Linda here.

178
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,109
Yes, Mr. Harglow.

179
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,878
-Gee, that was great.
I almost left myself.

180
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,605
Sit down, please.

181
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,313
I am a little short on patience
these days, I'm afraid.

182
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:43,027
So, Mr. Trent,
are you, uh, familiar with Arcane?

183
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,408
Aside from the fact that you're insured
by the company I work for...

184
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,912
...I never heard of Arcane. I'm sorry.
-You read books?

185
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,964
Linda Styles, John Trent.

186
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,465
Linda reads books for a living.
She's one of our best editors.

187
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,389
Since she joined the firm, she's been
handling Sutter Cane exclusively.

188
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,139
Sutter Cane. Isn't he the guy
that writes that horror crap?

189
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,060
Maybe he's too sophisticated for you.

190
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,731
Sutter Cane happens to be
this century's most widely-read author.

191
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,604
You can forget about Stephen King.

192
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,560
Cane outsells them all.

193
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,696
So, what happened
to this cash cow of yours?

194
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,696
Cane disappeared two months ago
without a trace.

195
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,995
The police have turned up nothing.

196
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,202
Who was the last person
to hear from him?

197
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,535
His agent. Cane mailed him
several chapters of his new book...

198
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,123
...oh, not two weeks ago.

199
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,881
Plain brown wrapper, no return address.

200
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,926
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

201
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,970
You don't mind, do you?

202
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,638
What'd the agent have to say?

203
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,357
Well, you heard what he had to say.

204
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,269
Heh, what are you talking about?

205
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,857
I understand you were there when the poor
man went crazy in Midtown Manhattan.

206
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,033
You witnessed the shooting, I believe.

207
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,612
That lunatic with the ax?
That was Cane's agent?

208
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,698
Hard to believe, isn't it?

209
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,872
You'd think a guy
that outsells Stephen King...

210
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,750
...could find better representation.

211
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,174
Excuse me.

212
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,099
Miss Styles,
this is what we have.

213
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,850
It's just a little joke.

214
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,149
Well, we're not in the mood.

215
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,647
<i>- I'll</i> see you out, Mr. Trent.
-Thank you.

216
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,401
Cane is a billion-dollar franchise.
He's the tent pole to this company.

217
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,573
We've sold film rights
to his new book...

218
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,994
...as well as publication rights
in 18 languages. it's--

219
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,571
Book you can't find?

220
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,454
- Well, his agent found it. At least part of it.
- Think he just took one look...

221
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,379
...at this latest work of art and
just went ax-happy in broad daylight?

222
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,958
I think it's great. It's great promotion
for Arcane, great publicity.

223
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,009
This was not a publicity stunt.
You were there.

224
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,932
Cane's writing has been known to have
an effect on his less-stable readers.

225
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,261
- Effect? Like what?
-Well, disorientation, memory loss...

226
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,936
...severe paranoid reaction.

227
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,186
People pay to feel like that?
It's cute. Put it in the press kit.

228
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,394
Look, we need you.

229
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,358
Okay-

230
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,783
Well, why don't you and I get together
after work? We'll go through his files.

231
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,656
I don't think so.

232
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,158
I need to see his contracts, papers,
you know?

233
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,659
Impossible.

234
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,710
His agent was a total buffer.
We don't even know where Cane lives.

235
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,661
What do you know?

236
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,374
For about a year before he disappeared,
his work became erratic...

237
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,676
...bent, more bizarre than usual.

238
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:51,677
He became convinced his writing was real,
not fiction, then the work stopped coming.

239
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,135
I need to know if he's alive or dead,
and I need that book.

240
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,391
We've delayed publication
as long as we can.

241
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,348
His fans are getting really restless.

242
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,017
This shit really sells, doesn't it?

243
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,601
More than you'd imagine. Surprised?

244
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,068
Lady, nothing surprises me.

245
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,116
We fucked up the air, the water,
we fucked up each other.

246
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:15,413
Why don't we finish the job by just
flushing our brains down the toilet?

247
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,286
Why don't you try reading his stuff...

248
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,000
...see if you can get it?

249
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,874
Got any on tape?

250
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,795
You want some too, buddy?

251
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:09,293
Now, relax, Robby.
Look, it's a scam. Of course it's a scam.

252
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,221
You see, all this strange behavior
from people that read the books...

253
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,220
...and, uh, the agent going
nuts and so on, it's a--

254
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,018
I figure it's like mass
hysteria, you know?

255
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,892
It's like, uh-- It's a pop phenomenon.

256
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,350
It's a craze. It'll pass.
This year's Hula-Hoop, something like that.

257
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,435
<i>before being stopped by police gunfire--</i>

258
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,986
Yeah, my God, it's freaky.

259
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,863
<i>Turning to the weather, here's Bill--</i>

260
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,696
No, it's a setup. It's a setup.
I just have to work out how it's set up.

261
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,323
That's all. It's just a matter of time.

262
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,700
You too?

263
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,500
God, I've had heartburn.
Tell me about it.

264
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,045
<i>Sporadic riots
continue to hit eastern cities...</i>

265
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,089
<i>...and reports of violence
from Boston and Philadelphia...</i>

266
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,792
<i>...are now coming in.</i>

267
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,550
<i>Police continue
to describe barely coherent witnesses...</i>

268
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,759
<i>...all reporting having read horror
novelist Sutter Cane's latest novel:</i>

269
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,684
Hobb's End Horror.

270
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,853
<i>Officers have been
physically attacked...</i>

271
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,432
<i>...and more than 380 people,
male and female...</i>

272
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,813
<i>...have been jailed in New York county.</i>

273
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:13,364
<i>Two officers in Boston were hacked
to death amid jeering crowds...</i>

274
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,862
<i>...in an attack last night.</i>

275
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,322
<i>What is this horrible,
unexplainable madness...</i>

276
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,247
<i>...that is gripping our lives?</i>

277
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,043
<i>- What in the world is happening?
- I can see.</i>

278
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,749
Now <i>we</i> have an editorial.

279
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,205
Excuse me?

280
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,878
He sees you.

281
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,340
Great, uh...

282
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,842
Tell him I say hi.

283
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,816
Hello.

284
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,481
Oh, hi, Robby, yeah.

285
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,780
Yeah, not a lot. it-- I picked up
some of these Sutter Cane books.

286
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,527
You know, I've been reading them.

287
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,694
Well, it-- Pulp horror novels.
They're all pretty familiar.

288
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,575
They all seem to have the same plot.

289
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,908
Slimy things in the dark, people go mad,
they turn into monsters.

290
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,370
The funny thing is that they're kind of
better-written than you expect, you know?

291
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,048
They get to you in a way.
I don't know if it's his style of writing...

292
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,799
...or his use of description
or whatever, but... Hmm?

293
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,343
No, don't be silly, ha, ha.

294
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,721
No, no, no.

295
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,514
Do you want some too, buddy?

296
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,141
He sees you.

297
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,313
He sees you.

298
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,276
He sees you.

299
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,186
What?

300
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,256
It's just too weird.

301
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,331
Beautiful.

302
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,509
Where did you go?

303
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,227
Assuming you went somewhere.

304
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,429
Cute.

305
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,433
Now I know why Cane
had the artwork done himself.

306
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,106
See this? It's a map.

307
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,651
The red dot is Hobb's End.
It's not on any real map, but look at this.

308
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,567
The two line up.

309
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,991
Like it or not,
Cane's book covers place Hobb's End...

310
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,989
...right in the middle of New England.

311
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,912
So you're saying
the man went someplace fictional?

312
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:58,289
No, no, no. It's a real place in a real state.
New Hampshire, to be precise.

313
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,835
But it's not on the map.

314
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,330
Well, not on any new ones,
but maybe on some old ones.

315
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,964
There's plenty of forgotten towns
across America.

316
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,386
Makes a great contest, doesn't it?

317
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:13,136
Put the pieces together, find the town,
win a Sutter Cane lunchbox.

318
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,351
How can you be sure he's there?

319
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,105
Well, I'd have to go to be sure.

320
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,649
You sure you want me to go?

321
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,775
See, I'm not suggesting you're lying, that
you're about to file a fraudulent claim...

322
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:31,359
...but forgive me
if this sounds a little bit like bullshit to me.

323
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,571
And if you're telling the truth,
if you want your author back...

324
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,578
...if you really want your book,
then maybe it's in both our best interests...

325
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,784
...if I go find him.

326
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,704
We have nothing to hide, Mr. Trent.

327
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,586
I desire only our fair share
if Cane is dead...

328
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,009
...or our property if he's alive.

329
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,678
Since I assume
you also have nothing to hide...

330
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,632
...I'm sure you won't mind
if I send Miss Styles along...

331
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,592
...on your expedition.

332
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,515
Well, it's your party.

333
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:09,648
<i>America the</i>

334
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,155
<i>Beautiful</i>

335
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,665
<i>From sea to</i>

336
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,248
<i>Shining</i>

337
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,675
Oh! Who was it? What?

338
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,511
You're awake.

339
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,647
Hey, hey, hey!

340
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,369
Couldn't you just
shake me, you asshole?

341
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:48,423
What did I do? What did I do?

342
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,897
We're lost.

343
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:57,202
We are lost because there is
no such place as Hobb's End.

344
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,321
Well, we'll see.

345
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,952
Never, never, never throw chips
at a driver.

346
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,044
- Goddamn it. Shit.
-Asshole.

347
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,761
Styles, can I ask you something?

348
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,928
Do you really like working
on Cane's stuff?

349
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,889
You really like busting people?

350
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,977
Yeah. I bust frauds, I bust phonies,
and, yeah, I love it.

351
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,562
Have you ever busted anyone you know?

352
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,694
Yeah. Sure, I did.
Didn't make any difference.

353
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:39,825
You see, in my business, you soon find out
that anybody's capable of anything.

354
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,451
If you can think of it, they've done it.

355
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,454
Doesn't leave you much to believe in.

356
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,818
Think of the upside.

357
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:48,563
It doesn't leave you too much
to be disappointed in either.

358
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,798
Believe me, the sooner we're
off the planet, the better.

359
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,959
Now you sound like Cane.

360
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,503
No, not me.

361
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,760
You're the Cane lover.

362
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,970
I just like being scared.

363
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,847
Cane's work scares me.

364
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,059
What's to be scared about?
It's not like it's real or anything.

365
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,813
It's not real from your point of view,
and reality shares your point of view.

366
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,602
What scares me about Cane's work...

367
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,521
...is what might happen
if reality shared his point of view.

368
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,961
Whoa, we're not talking
about reality here.

369
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:19,310
We're talking about fiction.
It's different.

370
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,579
A reality
is just what we tell each other it is.

371
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,282
Sane and insane
could easily switch places...

372
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,618
."Wtheinsane
were to become the majority.

373
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,750
You would find yourself locked
in a padded cell...

374
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:34,458
...wondering what happened
to the world.

375
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,714
No, that wouldn't happen to me.

376
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:41,549
Well, it would if you realized
everything you ever knew was gone.

377
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,929
It would be pretty lonely
being the last one left.

378
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,855
not only <i>in</i> Manhattan proper...

379
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,903
<i>...but there was that
incident in Long Island...</i>

380
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,320
<i>...that was also related to it.</i>

381
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,733
<i>Oh, come on, doctor, I don't buy this.</i>

382
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,066
<i>I mean, what are you saying?</i>

383
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,027
<i>That there's disease
spreading across the country?</i>

384
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,868
<i>It is an addiction
that people have at this time...</i>

385
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,204
<i>...of fantasy creating
a pile of written material.</i>

386
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,035
<i>How could it be addicting?</i>

387
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:13,167
<i>- Look, I mean this is words.
- All things have been...</i>

388
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,844
<i>Or just something
that is created by the press?</i>

389
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,352
<i>- That's not--
Acting stupid is what it is.</i>

390
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,552
- Jesus Christ.
-Huh.

391
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,754
I saw-- I saw a--

392
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,715
A cow, a sheep?

393
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,140
A pig? What did you see?

394
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,887
- Never mind. It was nothing.
- Good.

395
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,384
Don't move him.

396
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,883
- Is he alive?
- I don't know.

397
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,756
Don't move. He'll get a blanket.
Lie still.

398
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,013
- I can't get out.
- Don't move.

399
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,140
He won't let me out.

400
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,797
He was okay?

401
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,259
Come on, let's go.

402
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:29,091
We'll tell the cops
when we hit the next town.

403
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,385
You okay?

404
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,073
Oh, I can't believe it.

405
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,780
I must have slept
through the whole night.

406
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,494
Hey, thanks for driving.

407
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,835
What is it?

408
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,504
Look.

409
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,753
Styles, you're fantastic. You found it.

410
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,430
What's wrong?

411
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,095
You drive.

412
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,641
Cute, cute, cute.

413
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,695
Main Street, U.S.A.

414
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,908
Jesus.

415
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,656
Pfft.

416
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,083
Antiques.

417
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:55,389
This old crap. I wonder where
they manufacture this shit.

418
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,363
Look.

419
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,116
Those kids.

420
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,820
- You didn't see them?
-No.

421
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,919
Where is everyone?

422
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:24,101
It's like the place is picture
perfect and there's nobody around.

423
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,286
Come on.

424
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,941
Styles, how did you
know about this place?

425
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,896
I thought you'd never
been here before.

426
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,080
I haven't. I've read about it.

427
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,132
So have you.

428
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,719
This is empty now.

429
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,595
It used to be filled
with strange growing things, remember?

430
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,473
One night, the townspeople
saw something moving in here...

431
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:27,271
...something enormous,
with arms like snakes.

432
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,940
Oh, yeah.

433
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,234
<i>Hobb's End Horror.</i>

434
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,735
<i>The hotel from Hobb's End Horror.</i>

435
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,373
You know what I'm thinking?

436
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,061
There's gotta be a great
tie-in for a town like this.

437
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,536
I mean, think of the tourist potential,
for instance, or a--

438
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,538
There should be a painting behind us.

439
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,411
Oh, yeah.

440
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,458
It's nice.

441
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,461
There's a loose board there.

442
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,801
- Good morning.
-Hi.

443
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,681
Can I help you folks?

444
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,855
I certainly hope so.
We'd like a room, please.

445
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,727
We're on our way to Boston.

446
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,894
We thought we'd take a break
in your famous little town.

447
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,445
Famous?

448
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,398
Yeah, what with
the whole Sutter Cane thing and all.

449
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,404
Sutter who?

450
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,444
Cane.

451
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:26,744
We heard he came from around here
and comes back to stay once in a while.

452
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,834
I don't know anybody named Cane.

453
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:35,544
Heh, nobody passes through here
much anymore.

454
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,334
Let me get you your keys.

455
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,921
You want me to leave a deposit
or my credit card or something?

456
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,719
Oh, city folk.

457
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,176
- Mm.
-Heh. Oh.

458
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,815
Miss Styles,
if that's what you saw, then--

459
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,751
Yeah, heh, I guess it would
be a little unsettling.

460
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:57,512
I'd be a little unnerved myself.

461
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,817
But regardless of what you saw,
regardless of what you think...

462
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,154
...we are not living
inside a Sutter Cane story.

463
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,372
They're all in here.

464
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:15,627
The Mrs. Pickman in the book is a lunatic
who chops her husband into coleslaw.

465
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,842
That sweet old thing
that we met downstairs...

466
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,795
...isn't capable of anything worse...

467
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,424
...than dipping her dentures
into her husband's beer.

468
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,976
Trent, I know you think this is a joke.

469
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,599
Just listen to me for a second, please.

470
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,022
What if Cane's work isn't fiction?

471
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,147
Oh, for chrissake.

472
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,858
This is reality.

473
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,273
You hear that?

474
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,074
Reality.

475
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:47,950
Now, if what you're saying is true,
there should be out that window...

476
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,875
...a black Byzantine church
with 250-foot spires...

477
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,702
...with gold onions on the top.

478
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,537
Now, look.

479
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,755
You see?

480
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,583
Reality.

481
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,465
You didn't read closely enough.

482
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,839
The view is from the east.

483
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,856
"This place had once been the seat...

484
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,561
...of an evil older than mankind
and wider than the known universe.

485
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:23,819
It was a place of pain and suffering
beyond human understanding."

486
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,822
You got me reading this thing
like it's a guidebook.

487
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:31,786
"Originally, there was an old stone
church built on this site in 1788...

488
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,994
...but the black church swallowed up
the old sanctuary...

489
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,454
...the way it has swallowed our minds.

490
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,836
Now there is nothing left
of what was once here...

491
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,171
...except the mosaic of our Lord
and savior above the front door.

492
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,511
Some believe the old sanctuary
still exists somewhere...

493
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,064
...trapped inside this evil edifice.

494
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,564
It's primeval inhabitants
were a murderous race of creatures...

495
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,862
...whose vile existence
contaminated time itself...

496
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,566
...affecting history
with their sadistic wickedness."

497
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,221
It's the battle for heaven.
Archangel Michael's fighting off--

498
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,050
"Fighting off one of the creatures
from the other side."

499
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,977
A representation. The things
Cane writes are indescribable.

500
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,395
Beyond description.

501
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,939
Right.

502
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,767
Look, we're wasting our time.
We ought to be asking about Cane.

503
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,649
We'll have somebody to ask
in about two seconds.

504
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
Come on, we have to get out of here.

505
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,353
We can't be in front
of the church, Trent.

506
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:54,556
They have guns, Trent.

507
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,376
Cane!

508
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,849
No, I wanna go back.

509
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,182
Give him back!

510
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,520
Johnny.

511
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,321
Johnny boy.

512
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,218
Is that Cane?

513
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,874
Get in the truck.

514
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,460
- No!
- Where are they coming from?

515
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,881
No, no, no! Stop it!

516
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,650
I see.

517
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,318
Tell me how you knew about that mob.
Tell me that. Huh?

518
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,788
You see, you can't bullshit
a bullshitter, can you?

519
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:02,162
I'll tell you how. This whole thing
has been staged, that's how.

520
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,414
You, Harglow, and Cane
put me through this...

521
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,672
...so I can blab to the media
about "Cane's haunted little town"...

522
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,881
...help you sell a few
more million copies.

523
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:10,699
Well, fuck that.

524
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,631
- You're wrong.
-No, I'm not.

525
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,805
Before I leave, I'm gonna find someone
who's gonna come clean.

526
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,133
We're gonna dismiss your bullshit claim.

527
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,639
You're wrong, Trent.
I know you are wrong.

528
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,890
How am I wrong?

529
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,267
Because you're right.
You're half right.

530
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,852
This was a hoax.

531
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:29,436
We did send Cane away on a publicity
stunt, only he never showed up.

532
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:32,318
Harglow sent me with you
to make it look good...

533
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,240
...only we weren't supposed
to find anything, but we did.

534
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,035
That's how I know
what we're seeing is real.

535
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,455
We didn't stage any of this.

536
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,532
It's all happening for real, Trent.

537
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,084
And it is all in that book
and that's how I know.

538
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,833
You're lying.
I read the books too, you remember?

539
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,335
There's nothing about any mob,
any little girl.

540
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,502
Not in the old books, Trent.
In the new one.

541
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:58,424
No one knew what was in it
except me and Cane's agent.

542
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,521
All right.

543
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,981
What's it about, the new one?

544
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:13,780
It's about the end to everything
and it starts here in this place...

545
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,451
...with an evil that returns and takes
over Hobb's End piece by piece...

546
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,244
...starting with the children.

547
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:25,245
It's about people turning into things,
creatures that aren't human anymore.

548
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,794
It's fiction, Styles. Fiction.

549
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,002
We need to read the new book
to find the way out.

550
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,674
How is that gonna help?

551
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,127
We could skip to the ending.

552
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,846
Styles, I really hope
you're making this up...

553
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,890
...because if you're not,
you're actually crazy.

554
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,185
Please, Trent.

555
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:48,515
Don't make me do this alone.

556
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,851
Hey. Hey-

557
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,362
Are you coming with me?

558
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,822
Fine.

559
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,571
Have a nice bus ride home.

560
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,858
No smoking, please.

561
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,112
It bothers my husband.

562
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,241
I'm sorry. I just can't seem
to help myself around here.

563
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,328
I was just on my way out. I thought
I'd stop and admire the artwork.

564
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,125
It's beautiful, isn't it?

565
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,203
Sure is.

566
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,251
Styles told me you painted it yourself.

567
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,254
Styles?

568
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,677
Oh, the--

569
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,848
You mean the pretty young thing
you came in here with.

570
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,889
I don't know her at all.

571
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,269
Does she know me?

572
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,723
Well, she claims she does.

573
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,021
So you're not responsible for this?

574
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,151
Hell, no.

575
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,606
Well, it's a nice place you got here.

576
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,738
Oh, it must be a hell of a thing
to keep clean.

577
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,911
You look as if you've been up all night.

578
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,286
Been reading.

579
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,924
Styles?

580
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,309
Styles!

581
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,645
Styles!

582
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,730
Hush.

583
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,468
You're a writer?

584
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,647
No. You an actor?

585
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,975
Take a hint. Leave.

586
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,810
This ain't no tourist town.

587
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,945
Oh, I've been trying to.

588
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,524
You guys are good, you know?

589
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,952
You, the old lady at the hotel...

590
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,745
...really, really good.

591
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,494
Cane's been messing with the church.

592
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,577
Now, something came leaking out,
took the little ones first...

593
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,127
...then passed it on to us.

594
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,544
Can I buy you a beer?

595
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,834
Don't let it get to you. Just get out.

596
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:19,521
Give it.

597
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,070
What are you?
Where do you come from?

598
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,448
- Where do you live?
-With you.

599
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,118
- Who takes care of you?
- You do.

600
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,195
You're my mommy.

601
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,451
Know what today is?

602
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,409
Today is Mommy's Day.

603
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,549
Styles?

604
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,011
Linda.

605
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,442
Linda.

606
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,229
Nice to see you again.

607
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,861
You can edit this one from the inside...

608
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,742
...looking out.

609
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,417
It's funny, isn't it?

610
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,419
For years,
I thought I was making all this up.

611
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,629
But they were telling
me what to write...

612
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:49,439
...giving me the power
to make it all real.

613
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,108
And now it is.

614
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,376
All those horrible, slimy things...

615
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,416
...trying to get back in?

616
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,372
They're all true.

617
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,306
Come.

618
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,314
See the instrument of their homecoming.

619
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,446
What you have come looking for.

620
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,483
The new Bible...

621
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,573
...that starts the change...

622
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,284
...helps you see.

623
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,016
Do you like my ending?

624
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,318
An)' Suggestions?

625
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,767
You found something.
Where did you go?

626
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,978
I'm losing me. I'm losing me, John.

627
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,813
Help me. I'm losing me.

628
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,651
- What's happening?
-I saw the book.

629
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,659
Don't look at it. Don't read it, John.

630
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,616
I'm losing me.

631
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,762
Mrs. Pickman?

632
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,000
Come on, you old bitch.

633
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,952
Mrs. Pickman?

634
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,315
Styles.

635
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:11,455
We're going. Now.

636
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:15,844
Styles?

637
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,936
Styles?

638
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:22,897
Fuck you!

639
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,704
You're still here.

640
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,657
Busy night.

641
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,747
Special effects, hidden speakers.

642
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,500
You people are professionals,
I'll give you that.

643
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,083
The thing I can't remember
is what came first.

644
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,635
Us or the book.

645
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,888
We are not living
in a Sutter Cane story!

646
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,682
This is not reality!

647
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,727
Reality is not what it used to be.

648
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:02,274
Oh, Jesus,
this place makes my head hurt.

649
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:06,570
Oh, really? Come on, look at this.

650
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:11,446
This was done by a 5-year-old,
my 5-year-old.

651
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,993
Johnny's sister.

652
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:16,447
She did me after she did her mom.

653
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,575
You're alone.

654
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,591
Oh, shit. Oh, no, don't.

655
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,010
I have to. He wrote me this way.

656
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,040
Oh, shit.

657
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,294
The key.

658
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,632
Jesus!

659
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,227
Christ.

660
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,486
Shit.

661
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:59,058
Never leave the city. Why don't I learn?

662
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,802
Are we leaving?

663
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,099
We're already home.

664
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,103
You should have believed me.

665
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:09,359
Where's the fucking highway?

666
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,982
Cane's writing me.
He wants me to kiss you.

667
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,689
Why?

668
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,025
- Because it's good for the book.
-Jesus.

669
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,032
-It's what the readers wanna read.
-Oh, God!

670
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:25,833
Go-- Get--

671
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,541
Get away from me!

672
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,231
Cane has a job for you.

673
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,220
A few bad calls.

674
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,142
A few wrong turns.

675
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:51,008
Do you wanna know the problem
with places like this?

676
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,222
With religion in general?

677
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:58,269
It's never known
how to convey the anatomy of horror.

678
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:01,147
Religion seeks discipline
through fear...

679
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:05,231
...yet doesn't understand
the true nature of creation.

680
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,742
No one's ever believed it enough
to make it real.

681
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,530
The same cannot be said of my work.

682
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,496
Your books aren't real.

683
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,578
But they've sold over a billion copies.

684
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,215
I've been translated into 18 languages.

685
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:28,010
More people believe in my work
than believe in the Bible.

686
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,466
You got a point?

687
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,983
I think you know it.

688
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:47,527
There has to be some kind of an
explanation for what I've seen tonight.

689
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,152
I'll sort this shit out later.

690
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:53,578
But right now, there has to be some kind
of a simple fucking explanation.

691
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,165
Always looking for the con.

692
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,794
Even now, you're trying to rationalize.

693
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,419
Anyway...

694
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,301
...your books suck.

695
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,551
You must try reading my new one.

696
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,729
The others have had quite an effect...

697
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,103
...but this one will drive you
absolutely mad.

698
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,317
So I'm told.

699
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,401
It'll make the world
ready for the change.

700
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:36,364
It takes its power
from new readers and new believers.

701
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,370
That's the point. Belief.

702
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,086
When people begin to
lose their ability...

703
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:47,382
...to know the difference
between fantasy and reality...

704
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,095
...the old ones
can begin theirjourney back.

705
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:57,388
The more people who believe,
the faster the journey.

706
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,061
And with the way the other books
have sold...

707
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:05,893
...this one is bound
to be very, very popular.

708
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,147
Want to see?

709
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:18,409
Cane.

710
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,419
All done.

711
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:34,922
<i>In the Mouth of Madness.</i>

712
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,600
Yours to deliver, Trent.

713
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:45,519
What?

714
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,856
I'll be joining my new publishers now.

715
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:57,615
You take the manuscript back to the
world for me, that's what you do.

716
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,030
What I do?

717
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,377
You are what I write.

718
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,501
Like this town.

719
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,708
It wasn't here before I wrote it.

720
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,252
And neither were you.

721
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:17,884
No.

722
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,095
I know what's real.

723
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,222
I know what I am...

724
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:24,179
...and nobody pulls my strings.

725
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:30,227
Did you think my agent attacked you
by accident?

726
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,525
He read about you in there.

727
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,487
He knew you'd bring it back
and start the change.

728
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,786
Make what's happened here
happen everywhere.

729
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:41,822
He tried to stop you.

730
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,624
I'm not a piece of fiction.

731
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:49,462
I think therefore you are.

732
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,250
Read it if you don't believe me.

733
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,713
See what I have in store for you.

734
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,886
I know what I am.

735
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,565
Go back.

736
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,483
Your world lies beyond that passage.

737
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,457
Go now.

738
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,790
I can't hold them back any longer.

739
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,308
"Trent stood at the edge of the rip...

740
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:33,691
...stared into the illimitable gulf
of the unknown...

741
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:38,522
...the Stygian world
yawning blackly beyond.

742
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:41,573
Trent's eyes refused to close.

743
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,526
He did not shriek...

744
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:49,082
...but the hideous unholy abominations
shrieked for him...

745
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:54,129
...as in the same second he saw
them spill and tumble upward...

746
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:58,174
...out of an enormous
carrion black pit...

747
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,253
...choked with the gleaming
white bones...

748
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,930
...of countless unhallowed centuries.

749
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:09,386
He began to back away from the rip
as the army of unspeakable figures...

750
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:12,438
...twilit by the glow
from the bottomless pit...

751
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:16,313
...came pouring at him
toward our world."

752
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,196
Come with me.

753
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:23,611
I can't.

754
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,615
I've read to the end.

755
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,023
Hey, kid.

756
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,074
You want a paper?

757
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,293
Have you been in an accident?

758
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,583
Yup.

759
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,170
You want me to get somebody?

760
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,639
No, just...

761
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,060
Just point me to the highway.

762
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,391
Straight up.

763
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,811
Hey, kid.

764
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,151
Did you ever hear of Hobb's End?

765
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,255
No!

766
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,958
<i>No!</i>

767
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,795
Mr. Trent.

768
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,163
What?

769
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,207
Package for you, sir.

770
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,585
But nobody knows I'm here.

771
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,800
Well, someone does.

772
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,618
- Who delivered this?
-I don't know.

773
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:44,261
- Who?

774
01:17:44,287 --> 01:17:46,024
I don't know.
I wasn't here last night.

775
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,796
- Who was it?
- I was.

776
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,795
And I didn't see shit.

777
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:13,527
I remember New York
during the Depression.

778
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:16,484
People think they have it bad now.

779
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:20,117
You should have seen the Bowery
back then.

780
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:24,701
Bodies piled 2, 3 feet high
off the gutter.

781
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,604
I'm not going anywhere.

782
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:48,557
I'm God now, you understand?

783
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:51,689
God's not supposed
to be a hack horror writer.

784
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:55,398
But maybe I can help you believe.

785
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:57,279
Look around when you wake up.

786
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:02,117
Did I ever tell you my
favorite color was blue?

787
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,969
Relax, buddy. Relax.

788
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:30,308
- You're awake now.
-It was just a bad dream.

789
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,440
Are you deaf and dumb, sir?

790
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:39,074
I was just there in the town,
in that town...

791
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:43,746
...and there were people there
and shops and homes and--

792
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:45,414
I don't doubt that.

793
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,912
What I'm telling you for
the 10th time...

794
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:50,370
...is it couldn't have
been called Hobb's End.

795
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:54,047
There never was, is,
or shall be any such place...

796
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:56,967
...by that name in this state.
Ever.

797
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,299
I wanna see your supervisor!

798
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:48,394
Well, that is
quite a story.

799
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,473
If you could write it,
I'd publish it.

800
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,892
You don't believe it, do you?

801
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:02,359
Well, if I don't, what's my option?
That I'm crazy?

802
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,027
I'm not crazy.

803
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,329
Have you heard the rumors...

804
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:12,285
...that, uh, Cane's books
have affected certain readers?

805
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,746
Yeah, Styles told me.

806
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:19,880
Styles. Oh, that's the girl you say
I sent with you that...

807
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,553
But I know I sent you off alone.

808
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,590
Why wouldn't I remember her?

809
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,346
Well...

810
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:36,016
Well, that's easy.
She was written out.

811
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,855
- Written out?
- Yeah.

812
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:44,067
Look, do you think those books
somehow infected you?

813
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,326
Listen to me, Harglow.

814
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:49,155
Everything I've said is true.
It's real.

815
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:53,163
And that's why I had to destroy
the last manuscript.

816
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:56,169
But I know that's not true.

817
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,460
What are you talking about?

818
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,593
You delivered that manuscript
to me months ago.

819
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,971
To me personally in this room.

820
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:10,263
- I did?
-Yes, you did. Last spring.

821
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,811
For God's sakes, we published in July.

822
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,184
The book's been in the stores
for seven weeks.

823
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:18,855
Have you read it?

824
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:23,272
No, I never read Cane's work.
I haven't got the stomach for it.

825
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:26,401
Pull it. Don't distribute it.

826
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,862
Even if everything I've said
is totally Looney <i>Tunes...</i>

827
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,243
...I know this book
will drive people crazy.

828
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,084
Well, let's hope so.

829
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,707
The movie comes out next month.

830
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,221
<i>The newest
and presumably posthumous work</i>

831
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:56,806
<i>...of Sutter Cane continues to sit
at number one on the best-seller list.</i>

832
01:22:57,014 --> 01:23:01,861
<i>In the Mouth of Madness is expected
to break all previous publishing records.</i>

833
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,688
<i>On the local scene,
police are at a loss to explain...</i>

834
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:08,151
<i>...the outbreak of violent crime
among the city's clergy.</i>

835
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,360
<i>The mayor has called
an emergency meeting...</i>

836
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,621
<i>...of law enforcement
and medical agencies...</i>

837
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:16,659
<i>...to discuss an apparent epidemic
of paranoid schizophrenia.</i>

838
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:19,245
<i>Just an
unbelievably horrible story, Bob.</i>

839
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:23,003
<i>What began locally has now
broken out into a global epidemic.</i>

840
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,630
<i>An epidemic of monumental
proportions...</i>

841
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,213
<i>...of senseless, seemingly
unmotivated acts of violence.</i>

842
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:32,265
<i>- There are major...
-Like the book?</i>

843
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,968
I love it.

844
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,603
Good.

845
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,973
Then this shouldn't
come as a surprise.

846
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,080
It's spreading out there,
isn't it?

847
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,413
Just because you know
the symptoms doesn't mean...

848
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,214
...to say your story's true.

849
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,751
It's Cane's story.

850
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,049
And it'll spread with
each new reader.

851
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:13,053
That's how it gets its power.

852
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:17,102
What about the people
who don't read?

853
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:21,606
There's a movie.

854
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,519
Oh, yes, of course.

855
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,572
I'm gonna leave now.

856
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,329
But I'll be coming back,
I promise.

857
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,453
I want to help you.

858
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:43,083
There's no hurry.
It's safer in here now.

859
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,623
It'll get worse out there.

860
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,545
Why?

861
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:53,464
Every species
can smell its own extinction.

862
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,767
The last ones left...

863
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,973
...won't have a pretty time of it.

864
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:03,566
And in 10 years, maybe less...

865
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:09,064
...the human race will just
be a bedtime story for their children.

866
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:12,241
A myth. Nothing more.

867
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:36,007
Did he have anything to say?

868
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:38,934
No. It was useless.

869
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:41,265
He thinks he's fiction...

870
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,395
...and that Sutter Cane's
causing the epidemic.

871
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:51,356
Do you read Sutter Cane?

872
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:25,810
Oh, God!

873
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,774
<i>I'll try to continue
this emergency broadcast...</i>

874
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:39,440
<i>...as long as we can hold out here.</i>

875
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:41,824
<i>The city
is almost completely deserted now.</i>

876
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:45,620
<i>There are only a few stragglers left
on the streets.</i>

877
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:50,000
<i>No emergency services. The fires
continue to burn out of control.</i>

878
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,000
<i>This incredible epidemic
of random mass killing...</i>

879
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:56,707
<i>...has spread to every country
in the civilized world.</i>

880
01:28:56,915 --> 01:29:00,340
<i>Every hour,
more people are becoming infected...</i>

881
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:03,889
<i>...being driven to senseless acts
of extreme violence.</i>

882
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,763
<i>Now, we have gotten reports,
sketchy at best...</i>

883
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:10,938
<i>...of people mutating,
their bodies swelling and distorting...</i>

884
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:13,139
<i>...changing somehow.</i>

885
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:16,564
<i>Locally, the mass killings appear
to have moved inland.</i>

886
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,895
<i>All major cities on the
East Coast are silent.</i>

887
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:22,066
<i>We lost contact with Los Angeles
and the West Coast last night.</i>

888
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:26,199
<i>So it's impossible at this time to know
how many unaffected people are left.</i>

889
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:32,751
<i>If for any reason, you are one of us
who hasn't become infected...</i>

890
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,419
<i>...take shelter immediately.</i>

891
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,713
<i>Do not trust any friends
or family members.</i>

892
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,291
<i>I repeat, do not--</i>

893
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,511
<i>Oh, you go in. Get in there.</i>

894
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:44,762
Go.

895
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,465
No!

896
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,346
<i>No, wait, wait.</i>

897
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:51,770
<i>I'm sorry about the balls.
It was a lucky shot, that's all.</i>

898
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,472
<i>Wait!</i>

899
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,603
<i>I'm not insane.</i>

900
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:59,357
<i>Do you hear me?
I'm not insane!</i>

901
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:05,784
Relax, <i>buddy.</i>
You're awake now.

902
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,863
<i>This is not a Sutter Cane story.
This is not reality.</i>

903
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,618
<i>Not reality. Not reality.</i>

904
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,121
<i>This is reality.</i>

905
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,543
<i>Hear that? Reality.</i>

906
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:17,838
<i>Not reality. Reality.</i>
