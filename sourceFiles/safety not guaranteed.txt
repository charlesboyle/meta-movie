1
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,325
How far back do you want me to go?

2
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,788
College?

3
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,165
I was totally outgoing.

4
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,668
A real people person.

5
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,507
In high school, I felt like that mouse

6
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,261
that gets dropped into the snake cage
and just kinda sits there,

7
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,388
frozen, trying to blend in.

8
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,143
I guess I remember being happy
when I was a kid.

9
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,187
Back when you just naturally expect
good things to happen.

10
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,899
Before my mom died.

11
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,780
Now I just expect the worst

12
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,450
and try not to get my hopes up.

13
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,703
Which is why I'm here.

14
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,371
Does that answer the question?

15
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,335
Usually people just say where they're from
and where they worked before.

16
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,464
Great. I'm already overqualified.

17
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,674
So, in your previous experience,

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,303
can you give me an instance
in which you went above and beyond

19
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,181
the call of duty for a customer?

20
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,474
No.

21
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,727
I get it.

22
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,231
You think you're too good for this.
Why are you even here?

23
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,984
No, I'm sorry...

24
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,738
I really need the money.

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,784
I Iive at home,
I work my ass off at this internship.

26
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,328
- I just...
- Yeah, it's not gonna work out here.

27
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:04,165
I can tell your type.
You're just not a quality hire.

28
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,731
Wazzup?

29
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,576
No, I don't want the prepubescent Iook.
I want a woman.

30
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,871
We don't retouch at Seattle Magazine.
We're journalists.

31
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,123
No, not there. An intern.

32
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,542
Yeah.

33
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,877
That's what I'm saying. We respect women.

34
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,046
Don't put that there.
That goes in the utility closet...

35
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,548
- I know...
- And then refresh all the bathrooms.

36
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,757
I was just giving you this change.

37
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,717
Yeah, this is my job now.

38
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,053
It's Iike spelling things out for interns.

39
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,861
Fuck! Okay.

40
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,696
Writers, ideas.

41
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,575
It's idea time again. It's that time.
What have you got?

42
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,454
Does anybody have an idea? Or a story?

43
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,876
Are you guys here?
Can you hear me? Anyone?

44
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,503
- Top 10 dog parks in Seattle.
- No.

45
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,589
Summer activities for winter people.

46
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,924
Not interested. Jeff?

47
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,802
AII right. How about this time travel ad?

48
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,928
What have you got?

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,224
Yeah, somebody e-mailed it in
from the classifieds.

50
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,102
He's Iooking for somebody to go
back in time with him.

51
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,438
Do a Iittle tongue-in-cheek investigation.

52
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,566
Find this guy,
see if he thinks it's real or if it's a prank.

53
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,650
Not bad.

54
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,360
The guy says, "You'll get paid
when you get back.

55
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,862
"Bring your own weapons.

56
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,574
"Safety's not guaranteed."
And he's only done this once before.

57
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,702
See if maybe he believes in this stuff.
I don't know. I think it could be funny.

58
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,663
You wanna do it? AII right. You got it.

59
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,956
Can I get a couple interns?

60
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,583
- Help me with the research?
- I'll do it.

61
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,711
- Do some heavy Iifting...
- Me, too, please. Me.

62
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,505
AII right. Give me the Iesbian and the Indian,
and I got a story.

63
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,634
We sent a Ietter to the address in the ad
and asked them to get back to us.

64
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,093
And I called the Iocal paper,

65
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,555
but they're really uptight about giving out
information on people that take out ads, so...

66
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,723
I fucked Bridget.

67
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,894
Yeah. You know, sometimes
somebody pisses you off so much

68
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,395
that you just wanna get in there with...

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,106
Did she Iike criticize your technique
the whole time?

70
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,901
Like boss you around? She did, right?

71
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,028
Maybe a Iittle.

72
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,948
AII right, we should go.
Let's go to Ocean View.

73
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,742
We can just find whoever put up the ad
and stake him out.

74
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,661
We? What do you mean "we"?

75
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,497
I mean we, the three of us.
Now you don't wanna go?

76
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,707
- That place sucks.
- That place does not suck.

77
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,501
I had the best summer of my Iife
in Ocean View.

78
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,252
I'm not going.

79
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,046
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

80
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,424
It seemed Iike I was asking,
but I'm actually telling as your boss.

81
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,176
You're coming.

82
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,805
Dad, I'm going out of town for a few days.

83
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,934
- Out out?
- No, it's just this work thing.

84
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,356
Yeah, I think it'd be great if you went out,
did a Iittle social stuff.

85
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,983
Get out of your funk.

86
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,610
I have no funk. I'm totally funkless.

87
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:23,197
Going out and being with your friends.
I think it's a great idea.

88
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,241
What's wrong with me?

89
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:30,371
Well, you're sad.
I don't know how to describe it.

90
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,875
It's Iike there's a cloud following you.

91
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,879
- You're antisocial, and you're a virgin.
- What?

92
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,965
I don't ever see you with any guys.

93
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,800
I don't remember the Iast time
you brought a guy home.

94
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:47,430
Yeah, well, how do you know I'm not
on Craigslist having casual encounters?

95
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,432
Or when I was away at the dorms?
You weren't there.

96
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,808
I talked to Amy.

97
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,309
Why are you talking
to my college roommate?

98
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,436
We're Facebook friends.

99
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,397
Oh, my God! How do I eject?

100
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,036
Why do you have flames on your Iaptop?

101
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,248
It's a gaming Iaptop. It's really fast.

102
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,381
What time would you go back to?

103
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,093
- If you could?
- I don't know.

104
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,932
- I'm fine here.
- I would definitely go back.

105
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,435
Everything cool is gone.

106
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,438
The Aztecs.

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,816
People killing themselves for each other.

108
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,027
You wouldn't wanna see the dragons
and the elves

109
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,029
fight each other in the magical forest?

110
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,908
- Come on!
- No. That wasn't a time.

111
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,872
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,210
Get in, retards.

113
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,511
So, here's what I'm thinking.
We're budgeted for two rooms,

114
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,887
but if we share a room,

115
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,806
we can use that extra money
for some other shit.

116
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,516
- What, drugs?
- That's exactly right.

117
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,644
Easy, Arnau, we're messing with you, pal.

118
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,855
We're talking about using it
for buffets and shit.

119
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,733
You never done coke or anything
when you're studying for an exam?

120
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,361
Cocaine? Are you crazy?

121
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,823
- What is it you study?
- Biological and Iife sciences.

122
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,909
Makes sense. So what are you doing
interning at a magazine?

123
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,411
Diversity Iooks good on an application
for grad school.

124
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,623
We got to get you Iaid on this vacation.
That's what needs to happen.

125
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,335
- Vacation?
- AII right, work trip, whatever.

126
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,879
It's freezing here.

127
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,047
It's got bite, don't it?

128
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,341
Reminds me of going back to school.

129
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,928
Yes. It's all one Iong school year now.

130
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,722
No start, no finish.

131
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,808
Except for this guy.

132
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,311
How many years till you graduate, Arnau?

133
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,855
Total, including doctorate
orjust undergraduate?

134
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,565
Forget it.

135
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,823
How're we doing the beds?

136
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,117
We'll do me in one, interns on the other.

137
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,702
- Okay.
- No.

138
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,746
Cool. Me and Darius.

139
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,082
Fine. I hope you moisturize, Arnau,
'cause I cuddle.

140
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,753
Tomorrow morning first thing,
we hit the post office.

141
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,422
Let's hope our boy checks
his P.O. Box every day.

142
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,132
There she is.

143
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,427
What?

144
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,141
"Wanted, someone to travel
back in time with me,

145
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,268
"this is not a joke.

146
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,357
"P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, Washington.

147
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:31,111
"You'll get paid after we get back.
Must bring your own weapons.

148
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,323
"Safety not guaranteed."

149
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,330
Hey, here we go.

150
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,375
No way. He's too old to be time traveling.

151
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,046
Come on. That's the time traveling demo.
White beards, spectacles, pipes.

152
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,301
- Close.
- Wait, what about this one?

153
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,389
Yeah. She wants to stop whoever
gave her that haircut from being born.

154
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,673
Yo! Yo! It's him. It's the guy.

155
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,591
Him? Are you sure?

156
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,594
Yeah, I'm sure. Box 91. Get in.

157
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,596
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Following him.

158
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,640
What about Jeff? You should call him!

159
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,664
That's pretty amazing stuff, man.

160
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,542
I'll tell you about the cat in the box theory,
it'll blow your mind.

161
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,170
It's Iike I'm the only one who really gets it.
You know?

162
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,882
I started this dialog with some
big shot theoretical physicist online,

163
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,427
and I'm Iike, "Do the rules of quantum
mechanics allow for alternate histories?"

164
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,970
And he just blasted me.

165
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,098
You know, people are just so convinced
it's a fixed thing,

166
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,351
but they're just, Iike, Iooking
at this Iittle sliver of time,

167
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,435
that's all people can see.

168
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,106
It's not a fixed thing, Shannon.
You know, it's on and on in both directions.

169
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,690
It's Iike a "V," you know what I mean?

170
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,275
I gotta do a bathroom check, brother.

171
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,111
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

172
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,283
I'd Iike to fill out a comment card
on one of your employees, Kenneth.

173
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,701
What's his Iast name?

174
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,371
Sorry, ma'am, he's a Iittle...

175
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,624
No, no, it's a positive comment.
It's Iike complimenting him.

176
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,003
Good. Kenneth Calloway.

177
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,172
Calloway.

178
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,637
Thanks.

179
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,600
Hit the thing that says I have a new message.

180
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,979
"Liz confirmed you on Facebook."

181
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,399
Here. No photos, that's a drag.

182
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,402
Okay, good. She still Iives here.
She Iives in this town.

183
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,654
Who is Liz McHollis?

184
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,739
She was a girl I had a fling with

185
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,658
when my family used to come here
over the summers.

186
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,620
She was this really smokin' hot blond.
She was my first blowjob.

187
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:13,333
If there's one girl
that I still think about, honestly.

188
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,173
Here she is. Look at you, you went all rogue.
What did you get?

189
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,842
- Got his name, where he works.
- Great.

190
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,469
What did you guys get?

191
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,474
She accepted, but no photo,
so I'm not really sure.

192
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,600
What?

193
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,478
He came here to hook up
with an old high school girlfriend.

194
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,938
Seriously? That's what you've been doing?

195
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,357
Well, I've been doing other stuff too, but

196
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,651
maybe this will change your attitude
a Iittle bit.

197
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,654
That's her when she was 18,
I used to see her naked.

198
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,739
So?

199
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,824
So I'm coming back
to try to see her naked again.

200
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,119
I'd be weirded out if some guy tried
to track me down after 20 years.

201
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,039
I'd be weirded out too
if some guy tried to track you down.

202
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,790
- Why?
- Who would do that?

203
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,793
Tomorrow morning, I'll go in.

204
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,671
You know, go undercover,
pretend to answer his ad

205
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,090
and get the scoop on this yo-yo.

206
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,520
- 991 Mallory. This is definitely it.
- What a piece of shit.

207
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,065
AII right, I'm goin' in.

208
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,317
- How do I Iook, Arnau? Good.
- Good.

209
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,152
- Can I go in?
- No, you did good Iast night,

210
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,780
but I'm gonna handle this.
I don't wanna overwhelm the guy.

211
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,032
AII right? Wish me Iuck.

212
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,876
So...

213
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,714
Do you go out a Iot back home,
Iike clubs and stuff?

214
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,258
Not really.

215
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,511
You know those really tight Ieggings
that girls wear,

216
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,846
do you ever wear those?

217
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,139
No.

218
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,184
I think you would Iook nice in them.

219
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,286
Hello?

220
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,966
Kenneth?

221
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,222
Kenneth? Kenneth Calloway, right?

222
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,975
Is that right?

223
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,022
My name is Jeff.

224
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,904
Look, I saw your ad in the classifieds.
I wanna know if you need a partner.

225
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,035
- What's your mission?
- What do you mean what's my mission?

226
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,911
What's your reason for going back?

227
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,833
Well, who wouldn't want to go back?
It's an amazing opportunity.

228
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,793
To go back in time, you know?

229
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,672
See gladiators and watch dinosaurs
with my own eyes.

230
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,925
Have sex with a pilgrim.

231
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,762
Fun stuff, that's all I want.
I wanna go back. It's neat.

232
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,096
Who wouldn't want to go back, Kenneth?

233
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,890
You wanna go back.
Why do you wanna go back?

234
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,939
Well, do you need a partner?

235
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,115
- Can you Iook fear and danger in the eye?
- That's an odd question.

236
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,535
Have you ever stared
fear and danger in the eye

237
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,746
and said, "Yes"?

238
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,376
- Sure.
- Get off my porch.

239
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,920
Let's start over. Come on, we could be pals.

240
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,548
Let's go back in time.

241
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,344
Man, that smile...

242
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,138
What is that smile?

243
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,267
- You don't know pain.
- I don't know pain?

244
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,478
- You don't know regret.
- Yeah. AII right.

245
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,480
- You don't know...
- Okay.

246
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,316
Well, it was really nice to meet you.

247
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,578
That's what I thought.

248
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,667
So, what'd he say?

249
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,420
Well, he's the real deal. That ad is no prank.

250
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:30,215
He's not Iike retarded,
but there's something wrong with this guy.

251
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,759
Definitely didn't Iike my ass, I'll tell you that.

252
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:36,304
- So, what, that's it?
- Oh, no, this just got good.

253
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,307
What makes you think
he won't slam the door in my face, too?

254
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,476
'Cause you gotta be sincere
and charm him, okay?

255
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,104
He's used to assholes Iike me
coming and making fun of him.

256
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,274
Also probably none of the other people
were beautiful girls.

257
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,276
- Easy, Arnau.
- What?

258
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,196
But he's right. Use that, too.
There's something off about this guy, okay?

259
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,949
So you gotta go slow,
Iike you're trapping a skittish animal.

260
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,911
You know, Iure him, play coy.
Girls know how to do that shit.

261
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,456
You're dangling my vagina
out there Iike bait?

262
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,915
What if this guy's a murderer?

263
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,126
What if he cuts me up into Iittle pieces
and eats me?

264
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,336
Then the story's even better.

265
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,659
Do you sell guns here?

266
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,663
- What kind of guns?
- I don't know.

267
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:48,084
Something sexy and affordable
with killing power.

268
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,006
You should try C&R Guns in Wilkins.

269
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,175
The state of Washington does not allow

270
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,929
the sale of firearms in the business premises
of a grocer.

271
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,599
What about those thingies

272
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:08,480
with the spiky ball
at the end of the chain things?

273
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,399
You know, with the... Do you have those?

274
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,110
What exactly is the intended use?

275
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,197
Is there a pest problem, or hunting?

276
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,117
Well, if your ad had been written properly,
I may have a better idea of what I need.

277
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,288
- My ad?
- Yeah.

278
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,874
- It's pretty sloppy.
- Excuse me?

279
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,042
You heard me.

280
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,503
I hope you worked harder
on your calibrations.

281
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,799
My calibrations are flippin' pinpoint, okay?

282
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,721
There are people after me.
How do I know you don't work for them?

283
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,431
Because I've never worked
for anybody in my Iife.

284
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:44,599
You ever faced certain death?

285
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,019
If it was so certain,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

286
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,573
This is a bad place to talk.

287
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,285
I get off in Iike 15. Rendezvous?

288
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,245
See you in eight.

289
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,682
- Get down!
- What's going on?

290
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,601
- Just get down! Don't Iet him see you.
- Wait, is he coming?

291
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,685
- Yeah.
- What the hell is he doing?

292
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,146
I don't know. He's all freaked out.
He thinks people are following him.

293
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,857
We're gonna rendezvous.
He's taking me to a secure Iocation.

294
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,275
Get down!

295
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,195
If this guy's taking you to some sex bunker,
he's gonna be freaked out

296
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,115
when me and Arnau pull out of this thing
Iike it's a clown car.

297
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,627
- Hey, what's going on out there?
- Get down!

298
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,422
Shit! He's coming!

299
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,049
Don't Iet him see me,
it'll blow everything for you.

300
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,636
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know! Do something!

301
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,682
We're being followed!
Go! Get in your car! Go!

302
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,234
What the hell is this?

303
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:21,947
- Oh, shit!
- Git! Git! Go! Get out!

304
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,324
- What the fuck?
- He's got a gun!

305
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,498
- Just get out.
- Where are we?

306
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:35,835
I don't know. Just get out.
I'll come get you when I'm done. Come on!

307
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,590
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Fuck that.

308
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,885
- Are you guys racist?
- It's complicated.

309
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,890
- Hello?
- It's too hot here right now. Can't talk.

310
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,852
Look, my gut tells me you're not with them,
but I have to be absolutely certain.

311
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,021
I'm gonna do
a quick background check on you.

312
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,607
If everything is good, I'll be in touch, okay?

313
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,526
Yeah, okay.

314
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,696
AII right, over and... Good night.

315
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,026
Hi, is Liz around?

316
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,954
And it's not necessarily...

317
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,749
It's not a false relationship,
but she's so charismatic.

318
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,920
She's such a beam of Iight.

319
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:05,884
AII the reporters are saying that.
Also, what I'm reading from...

320
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,180
I don't know. She was big, and Iike...

321
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,267
And Iike your age? Yeah. Gross.

322
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,436
It was more Iike...

323
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:20,315
I don't know, Iike the years
have not been kind to her, you know?

324
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,650
They pretty much took a shit
all over her face.

325
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,988
- So, did your dude call yet?
- No.

326
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,949
Maybe we should do a background check
on this guy,

327
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,118
you know, make sure he's not a psychopath.

328
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:35,038
- He seems pretty harmless.
- Don't worry, Darius, he'll call.

329
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:39,459
I'm sure your weird mojo clicked with
his weird mojo and you got it in the bag.

330
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,795
- C'mon!
- Ready, hike!

331
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,224
Hi.

332
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,895
- Thanks.
- Listen, I'm sorry about the noise Ievel here.

333
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,647
But we need to maintain cover.

334
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,649
I'm certain I'm being recorded,
I'm certain I'm being followed.

335
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,986
So, who are we dealing with here?

336
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,324
I'm not sure yet.
Government agents maybe. Probably.

337
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:12,742
But the joke's on them.

338
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,829
The technology I've invented
can't be understood by the average mind.

339
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,291
So, what are the means of transportation?

340
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,836
Just hold it in your holster
for a second, okay?

341
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,921
I'm still making up my mind about you
as a potential partner.

342
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,090
I have to be absolutely certain
that I can trust you

343
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,135
before I include you in certain information.

344
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,179
Well, I just don't wanna be jerked around.

345
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,098
You know, jerking around is forjerks.

346
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,274
God, I remember this smell.
The smell of grass.

347
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,901
I used to play a Iittle bit, back in the day.

348
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,445
- I think you should give Liz another chance.
- Oh, you do?

349
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,574
That sucks to spend all that time
thinking about her,

350
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,076
and you're finally here
and you don't follow through with it.

351
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:58,163
I think it's sad that you're a 22-year-old virgin
with those creepy glasses,

352
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,455
but I don't bring it up.

353
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,417
You know what? Actually, Arnau,
there are Iots of hot chicks here, man.

354
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,377
You could kill in a place Iike this.

355
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,255
You should run game.

356
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,383
Arnau, Arnau, Arnau, be cool, run game.

357
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,678
- She's in high school.
- I know!

358
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,222
I know she's in high school
and you're in college.

359
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,474
Who do you think that girl wants to fuck?
You!

360
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,851
- Could you, please!
- What?

361
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,228
So what's the year? Where are we going?

362
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,024
- 2001. Is that gonna work for you?
- It's perfect.

363
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,067
I will need to know the timetable, though.

364
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,612
There's a critical step soon.

365
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,740
I need to obtain certain materials
to facilitate the travel.

366
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,201
I plan to execute this step
within the next week.

367
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,412
Why 2001? What are you going back for?

368
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,582
Like I said, certain information
will have to wait.

369
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,626
Knock him on his ass, he's a bum!

370
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,378
- Right there, these two.
- AII right. Let's go.

371
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,215
Why? Sit down. We're not going anywhere.
Tell me why. Why?

372
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,258
You're drinking alcohol
at a high school game.

373
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,970
You're damn right I am.
United States ofAmerica.

374
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,348
Drinking a beer at a football game.

375
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,018
Don't get tough on me, big guy.
Let's not do this.

376
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,103
Wait a minute, I know him.
He came to my house.

377
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,649
I think that guy
is recording our conversation.

378
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,901
Is there somewhere else we can go?

379
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,027
Let's get out of here. Come on.

380
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,035
- Stay close. Yeah.
- Are you okay?

381
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,288
I really would have messed that guy up
if I wasn't trying to keep such a Iow profile.

382
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,540
I'm glad I got to see your qualities, though.

383
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,626
I think you're ready for the next step,
some basic training.

384
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,213
The heat's moving in. That's all for tonight.

385
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,973
I'm Ieaving. I'm walking out!

386
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,934
I'm Ieaving by choice. By choice.

387
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,437
- Seriously?
- This place is a dump. Let's get out of here.

388
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,106
Fuck.

389
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,949
Pretty good. You might be a one arm shooter.

390
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,993
- Okay, I'll try it.
- Let's just Ioosen it up.

391
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,786
- You ready?
- Yeah.

392
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,626
- Yeah! You smoked him!
- I smoked him.

393
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:09,961
Come on!

394
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,505
I think I'm getting better than you.

395
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,341
Hey, Iet's not get ahead of
yourself here, okay?

396
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,261
It's one thing to hit a target
that's standing still,

397
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,056
but think about it when the heat's moving in.

398
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,479
Smoke it!

399
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,537
Double smoke!

400
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,981
- How are your hamstrings holding up?
- Real good.

401
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:14,067
You're pretty impressive with a handgun.

402
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,029
It's a superlative performance
under simulated pressure.

403
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,405
Our chemistry is starting to build.

404
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,577
I really Iike your intensity.
You're, Iike, no-nonsense.

405
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,288
There's no sense in nonsense.
Especially when the heat's hot.

406
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,915
Exactly.

407
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,212
I Iike your intensity, too.

408
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,464
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You've got good moves.

409
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,841
Nobody's seen my moves before.

410
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,135
Haven't brought a candidate
this far into the training process.

411
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,428
Really?

412
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,597
We'll be Iearning from each other
from now on.

413
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,517
Good.

414
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,065
We still have to discuss your reason
for going back.

415
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,110
That's classified information.

416
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,529
I can appreciate that, I respect that,

417
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,156
but I have a certain responsibility to keep
as the Ieader of this mission.

418
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,284
Then I have to tell you that it's personal.

419
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,540
Darius, sometimes I think we are progressing
in this mission,

420
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,626
and then other times, I'm not so sure.

421
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,429
I'm going back to stop my mother
from dying when I was 14.

422
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,436
How'd she die?

423
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,772
She was killed by some guy.

424
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,235
Just some guy at a gas station
took her and killed her.

425
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,655
- Oh, man. Just some random thing?
- Yeah.

426
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,875
Well, no, actually.

427
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,005
She was driving home. It was really Iate,

428
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,009
and she called me to tell me
she was coming home, and I...

429
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:10,057
I asked her to stop
and get me chocolate milk.

430
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,061
Because I had to have chocolate milk.

431
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,150
So Iike five minutes Iater, she called me

432
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:23,404
to tell me that she got the chocolate milk
and she was coming home.

433
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,240
And her voice was Iike,

434
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,203
really excited, Iike she was really happy.

435
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:37,126
And I was, Iike, okay, whatever.
I wasn't even nice.

436
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,798
That was the Iast time I talked to her.

437
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,426
That's not your fault.

438
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,806
Yeah. That's what they tell me.

439
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,562
AII right, Darius.

440
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,651
I think you're ready. I trust you.

441
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,820
Good.

442
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,698
You should.

443
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,610
- Jeff! Hey!
- Hey. Liz, it's great to see you.

444
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,529
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

445
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,198
- So, this is where you Iive.
- This is my house.

446
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,325
Well, Iook, I wanna say
I'm sorry about yesterday.

447
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,202
I was gonna come,
but work's getting crazy and...

448
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:57,582
I was sad 'cause you got me
thinking about you on that Facebook.

449
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,169
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- I never thought I'd see you again.

450
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:06,549
Oh, God, excuse me. Would you come in?

451
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,634
I'd Iove to.

452
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,055
Your hair's red.

453
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,181
Yeah.

454
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,558
It's different.

455
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:20,021
Yeah. I changed it.
It's just about the only thing I've changed.

456
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,316
- Really?
- Yeah.

457
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,485
Kind of. What about you?

458
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,654
A Iot has changed. Almost, Iike, everything.

459
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,490
- Tell me.
- The car... I got an Escalade.

460
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:36,245
And my job's going really well.
Got a great condo.

461
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,957
Tell me about your Iife.

462
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,667
I just did.

463
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,046
- I've got to read this magazine of yours.
- Oh, don't.

464
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,215
- That is so exciting.
- It's not that exciting.

465
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,800
You know what?

466
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,595
I always thought you'd do something
special with your Iife.

467
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,723
If you knew what it was really Iike,
you wouldn't say it was special.

468
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,683
Oh, come on. What...

469
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,102
- What's wrong with your neck?
- Sorry I'm doing that.

470
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,230
It's just I got this shooting pain.
I have to share a bed with a male intern.

471
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,316
And I don't feel Iike
rubbing asses with him, so...

472
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,278
- Let me see.
- You don't have to do that.

473
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,159
- You need to put some heat on that.
- I do?

474
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,496
- I have pies in the oven.
- You make pies?

475
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,542
I made some pies.
I made peach, apple, strawberry rhubarb.

476
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,003
Which one do you want?

477
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,713
Yeah.

478
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,053
Liz, that is unbelievable.

479
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:39,350
You bake pies, you give these massages,

480
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,061
and you're not married?

481
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,105
I don't get it.

482
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,483
I was married. He was a ball player.

483
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,904
And I was the good Iittle wife,
baking cookies for the team.

484
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,823
Oh, my God, you bake cookies, too?

485
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,116
Cameron got traded,

486
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,536
and when he went up to the Marlins,
he started making money

487
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,165
and started messing around
with those Miami girls.

488
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,627
Well, I can say this honestly,
Cameron's an idiot.

489
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:08,963
Yeah, well, we were young.

490
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:13,008
Hey, do you have one free night
while you're in town?

491
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:17,012
Because I would Iike to make you
a homemade dinner.

492
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,309
I wanna eat that homemade dinner.

493
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,354
I'm just gonna press "record." Okay.

494
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,316
So, Kenneth,
why are you looking for a partner?

495
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,360
I feel Iike

496
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,448
the world is mostly full ofjankholes,

497
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,451
but I believe that there are purists out there,

498
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,077
and that's why I put that ad in the paper.

499
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,706
It's my hope that
if you're watching this video,

500
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,959
something incredible has happened.

501
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,545
I do believe that martial arts
are for self-defense only.

502
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,423
While I would like to maneuver through
this world with an open heart and mind,

503
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,883
sometimes that doesn't gain you favor.

504
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,093
So I just need to be equipped
with the necessary skill sets,

505
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,554
guns, training, weapons, fighting,

506
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,223
in case I encounter any obstacles
that need to be defeated.

507
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,058
- The area is clear.
- Oh, my God!

508
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,268
Mission accomplished.

509
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,314
- Wow! Man, that was intense.
- Task completed.

510
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,816
The mission has to do with regret

511
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:14,153
and the mission has to do with mistakes.

512
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,114
The mission's also about Iove.

513
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,747
I'm already saying too much.

514
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,167
Aren't you interested in some of
this equipment or something?

515
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,669
Can we talk about something else?

516
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,758
So it's very important that you and I
do not abuse the power

517
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,176
that will come with our knowledge
of the future.

518
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,805
No matter how tempting
it will be to gain personal fortune

519
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,058
or notoriety by say,
being the first person to Iist

520
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,685
the Contra code for up, up,
down, down, Ieft-right, Ieft-right, B-A-start.

521
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:50,272
Or to say, "Hey, Ieave your Star Wars
figurines in the box

522
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,858
"'cause they'll be worth Iike hundreds more
if they are super pristine."

523
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,862
But what about if it's, Iike,
for the betterment of future society?

524
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,825
Absolutely not. We have to stick to the plan.

525
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,496
So when do you fill me in on the plan?

526
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,374
Pretty soon. The action's getting hungry.

527
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,044
I can't eat here.

528
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:15,297
- Why?
- See that kid? He's Iike a mutant kid.

529
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,217
Hey, there's something on your ear.

530
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,136
- It's fine, it does...
- Are you okay?

531
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:25,057
- It Iooks Iike it's falling off or something.
- No, no, no. It's fine. Don't worry about it.

532
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,602
Shit! Sorry. It's off.

533
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,482
- Kenneth!
- The mission's off, I'm sorry.

534
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,110
Forget it. You're not the right one.

535
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,925
Hey, what's wrong?

536
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,636
It's fake.

537
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,765
- What's fake?
- My flipping ear is fake.

538
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,771
They used to make fun of me,
all the other kids.

539
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:22,698
My parents could only afford one prosthetic,
so I had to wait until I was fully-grown.

540
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,659
- You know that's not a big deal, right?
- Yes, it is!

541
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,203
No, it isn't.
People used to make fun of me, too.

542
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,705
Yeah, right.

543
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,084
I shave my arms and wax my upper Iip, okay?

544
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,004
- You're saying that to make me feel better.
- I'm serious.

545
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,298
I had a freaking mustache until I was 14.

546
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,308
Okay, we can still do this,
but you have to promise me

547
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,686
we're never, ever gonna talk about
my ear ever again

548
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,688
for as Iong as you and I both shall Iive.

549
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,649
- Okay. Okay.
- Forever.

550
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,984
- But can I say something?
- What?

551
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,236
I think it's kinda cool.

552
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,574
- Get in.
- Okay.

553
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:25,219
So then, what did you tell him your reason
for going back to 2001 is?

554
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,180
I just made up some story.

555
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,182
Yeah? What's the story?

556
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,851
I told him that I was gonna go back

557
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,687
and stop my parents from getting divorced.

558
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,773
Arnau, you son of a bitch. Smash him!

559
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,274
What are you doing?

560
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,486
Whatever I'm doing,
I'm feeling fan-fucking-tastic doing it.

561
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,531
Did you just have sex with that girl
you came here to stalk?

562
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,742
No, I didn't, actually.
We shared a nice conversation.

563
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,869
And you know the truth is, she's not that fat.

564
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:55,416
I don't know,
a girl's beauty, it's in the eyes, you know?

565
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,793
And that doesn't go away with age.

566
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,587
So, anyway,
can we please just focus on the article

567
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,174
and figure out what's wrong with this guy,
Iike Iow I.Q.,

568
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,385
or emotional disorder, or whatever it is?

569
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,053
What makes you think there's something
wrong with him?

570
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,222
'Cause he thinks he can go back in time.

571
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,433
Was there something wrong with Einstein
or David Bowie?

572
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,642
Not the same.

573
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,811
Just because the guy's
trying to do something new

574
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,979
doesn't mean he's a freak show.

575
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,231
So you think this is normal?

576
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,817
I don't know. Is it normal that your interns
do all your work for you?

577
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,360
- Is that normal?
- Right.

578
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,611
Is that how all your articles get written?

579
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,866
It's him. I have to go.

580
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,718
Okay, this is it.

581
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,762
There's technology inside this building

582
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:54,016
that I need to complete the machine
that will take us on ourjourney.

583
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,311
I'm gonna breach the outer perimeter,
gonna disable their security measures,

584
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,980
penetrate the target,
Iocate and secure the package,

585
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,691
then we'll rendezvous at the getaway point.
You got it?

586
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,276
Rendezvous at the getaway point.

587
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,903
- I've been watching this place for weeks.
- Yeah, got it.

588
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,281
- The security's full of holes. We'll be fine.
- Okay.

589
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,411
- Fuck!
- Stay focused.

590
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:25,130
What am I doing? Why am I doing this?

591
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,599
Let me see those keys.

592
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,211
Shit!

593
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:08,549
Okay.

594
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:41,892
Come on!

595
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,314
Excuse me?

596
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,484
Hey! Hey! What is that? What are those?

597
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,236
- Lasers.
- Lasers?

598
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,947
- Those are real Iasers?
- The mission's been compromised.

599
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,490
Hey. Where are you going?

600
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,283
Let's get out of here! Drive!

601
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,496
- Floor it!
- Sorry.

602
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,921
What do we do with the van?

603
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,423
Leave it. I stole it from the Iot.

604
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,927
Hey, you didn't hurt anyone, did you?
Like, you didn't...

605
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,804
No, no, no, no. Look, it's a fake.

606
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,514
- No casualties. Here. Take it.
- Okay.

607
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,556
- You okay?
- Yeah.

608
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,975
Take this. It'll make you feel better.

609
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,145
You're shaking.

610
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,314
It's just adrenaline from the infiltration.
It's good.

611
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,109
- You ready? Come on, Iet's go. Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,485
Go. Go.

613
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,821
We gotta stick to the back roads,
we can't be seen out here.

614
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,950
Oh, my God! Okay.

615
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,453
- Damn it! We're getting off the road.
- Why?

616
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,998
Those are government employees.
They'll blow our cover.

617
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,042
We gotta wait it out.

618
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,673
Kenneth, it's fine. They won't tell.

619
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,592
No. We can't have any witnesses
that will connect my car to the van.

620
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,594
The people that are after me
are gonna be on full alert.

621
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:00,971
They'll put the pieces together.

622
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,473
Totally unprofessional!

623
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,560
It's okay.

624
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,399
It's just...

625
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,613
It's a girl.

626
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,412
My reason for going back is a girl.

627
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,917
- Who was she?
- She's my first girlfriend.

628
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:36,173
Her birthday was the exact same day
in April as mine is in October.

629
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,510
We ended up working at the same restaurant.

630
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,845
She was just so nice to me.

631
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:46,099
She would make me special food

632
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:51,188
and after work, while all her friends
were getting ready to go out,

633
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:55,108
she would just hang out and talk with me.

634
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,361
She was really pretty.

635
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,739
What happened to her?

636
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,909
She died.

637
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,665
Some jerk,

638
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:17,089
some a-hole jerk in a band got drunk

639
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:22,135
and crashed his car into her Iiving room.

640
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,265
I should have been there, you know.

641
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,147
People tell you that

642
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,442
there are other girls out there, you know, and

643
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,611
it's not just about a girl, it's about...

644
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,740
It's about a time and a place.

645
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,827
Do you have a favorite song?

646
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,667
Would you tell me what it is?

647
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,294
- It's stupid.
- What is it?

648
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,340
Over the Rainbow.

649
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,427
It's a really beautiful song.

650
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,765
It's that time and that place and that song,

651
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,102
and you remember what it was Iike
when you're in that place,

652
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,562
and then you Iisten to that song,

653
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:17,649
and you know you're not in that place
anymore and it makes you feel hollow.

654
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,612
Can't just go find that stuff again.

655
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,871
I Iike your reason for going back.

656
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,420
It's really nice.

657
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,134
Thanks.

658
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,478
- Fucking Iasers?
- What kind of Iasers?

659
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,480
I don't know, I'm not a frickin' Stormtrooper.

660
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,064
This guy's awesome.
He's over there right now

661
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,941
thinking he's building
a frickin' time machine.

662
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,152
Hey, Arnau, what are the chances
he can do that with these Iasers?

663
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,570
- How would I know, I'm not a...
- He doesn't know.

664
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,654
He's not a frickin' Stormtrooper either.

665
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:08,033
Stormtroopers don't know anything
about Iasers or time travel,

666
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,910
they're blue-collar workers.

667
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,244
I gotta see this shit.

668
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,630
- Isn't this Iike violating his privacy?
- Don't worry about it.

669
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:26,468
I can't see much. Looks Iike an engine.

670
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,638
What are you building in there, Kenny?

671
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,446
Who's this asshole?

672
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,532
Oh, my God, there are people following him.

673
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,617
There are really people following him.

674
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,246
We're doing this.

675
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,511
Stay back. Don't spook him.

676
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:14,099
- Stay back. Don't scare them.
- This is fucking intense.

677
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,684
We're going fifteen miles an hour.

678
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,403
Shit. He saw us.

679
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,738
Oh, shit, they're onto us.

680
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,073
Onto what?

681
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:42,586
Shit.

682
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,922
Don't Iet him see you! Duck!

683
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,176
Stay down!

684
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,306
What the hell, did you see those guys?

685
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,516
They Iook Iike government agents
or something.

686
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,769
- He's really being followed.
- Holy shit! Is this guy for real?

687
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,691
- Kenneth? Are you okay?
- I can't talk right now, okay?

688
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,568
- Just watch your back.
- Okay.

689
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,528
- Stay Iow and Iay Iow.
- Yeah.

690
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:11,448
Go to the beach, I'll pick you up.
It's almost time, Darius.

691
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,537
This is totally crazy.

692
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,290
- Who do you think those guys are?
- I have no idea.

693
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:24,002
Maybe he's not totally insane, maybe he
really thinks he's doing something and...

694
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,503
I don't know.

695
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,049
What? Why are you Iooking at me Iike that?

696
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,718
I don't know. You got a thing for this guy?

697
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,136
What?

698
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,141
No! I'm talk...

699
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,393
You saw those guys.

700
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,104
Can I ask you a question?
Do you mind, as a reporter?

701
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,731
What?

702
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,192
What is it that you two weirdos
do when you're off alone?

703
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,195
I'm getting information.
What are you doing when you're off alone?

704
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,571
I'm seeing an old friend.

705
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,325
Just take me to the beach. I have to meet him.

706
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,292
AII right, this is it.

707
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:07,170
It's pretty obvious they see a threat in me
possessing this kind of power.

708
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,589
It's not clear yet what entity they represent.

709
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:12,384
Their presence here
definitely accelerates the plan, though.

710
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,137
They're gonna
have one of their guys at every door,

711
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,390
but you should be okay.
I don't think they've ID'ed you yet.

712
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,017
- Got it.
- Good Iuck.

713
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,061
Wait!

714
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:25,730
Go! Go!

715
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,244
Shannon?

716
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:45,750
I'm supposed to give this to you.
This is from Kenneth.

717
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,053
Kenneth said to give this to me?

718
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,726
My wife, she's...

719
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,397
You tell him...

720
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,902
Tell him I hope he gets wherever he's goin'

721
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:17,532
and it all works out Iike he wants.

722
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,160
I'll tell him.

723
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,633
AII good?

724
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:37,927
Yeah.

725
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,014
What?

726
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,517
Nothing.

727
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,415
Yeah, we're getting
some really great stuff, Bridget,

728
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm gonna need a couple more days.

729
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,128
Bridget, I'm doing an interview right now.

730
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,964
Yeah, I'll send you an e-mail
with all the information,

731
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,217
and I'll paint you a real picture.

732
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,968
Okay. I have to go right now.

733
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,932
That all seems so dangerous.
Her running around with this guy...

734
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:27,060
She'll be fine. You got any more
of that Ieftover pie? That was pretty good.

735
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:31,189
I was thinking about you
and the time we spent together.

736
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:35,151
I was pretty ripped back then.
Top of my game back then.

737
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,820
- You were not ripped.
- Yes, I was.

738
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:38,488
Why don't you feel me now?

739
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,209
You Iook great.

740
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,932
- Are you familiar with cryptography?
- Yeah. Of course.

741
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,809
Yeah. Well, I prefer
the St. Goodnight code and cipher

742
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,144
for sending messages
that can't be compromised.

743
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,815
It's just 4-4-3-1 -4 and
then you just reverse the whole thing, okay?

744
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,233
Yeah. Got it.

745
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,735
Learn it. Practice it.

746
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,738
Hey!

747
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,409
If I show you something, will you promise
not to tell anybody else about it, ever?

748
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,618
Yeah.

749
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,333
When we go back in time,
if anything bad happens,

750
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:34,961
if somebody gets hurt,

751
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:39,799
or if you mess up, or if the guys
who are after me find me and catch me,

752
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:42,927
put a note inside this tin.
I'm gonna do the same thing.

753
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:46,848
If anything goes wrong,
we go back and we fix it.

754
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,224
Okay.

755
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,274
So far so good.

756
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,235
So that's been there since 2001?

757
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,404
Since I was a kid.

758
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,323
I used to come up here

759
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,783
and camp with the Boy Scouts
near here when I was Iittle.

760
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,452
Do you know what Star Wars is?

761
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,038
- Yes.
- Yeah.

762
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:14,250
So, when I was younger,
I used to bring my Star Wars figures up here,

763
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:17,211
'cause I didn't wanna Ieave 'em
back at the house 'cause they'd get Ionely.

764
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:21,299
And some of the more cynical kids
would make fun of me,

765
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,551
- they would throw them in the fire and stuff...
- Really?

766
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,929
This was before my martial arts training,
of course.

767
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,972
But I found this hiding spot

768
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,516
and sneak out here at night,

769
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:36,022
and put 'em in the tin, take them out,
then put them back in the morning and...

770
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,148
Anyway...

771
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,651
I wish I could see you
when you were a Iittle kid.

772
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,320
I was not as impressive as I am now,
I can assure you.

773
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,155
- What?
- Yeah.

774
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,617
Okay.

775
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,827
- Wanna see something cool?
- Yeah.

776
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,454
Come on.

777
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,931
That was the best sex I've ever had.
And I've had a Iot of sex.

778
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,017
That's what you said about the roast chicken.

779
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,353
That was the best roast chicken I ever had.

780
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,315
You don't know
how Iong I've thought about this.

781
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,069
You've become this, Iike, character

782
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,281
in my head that's Iike,
it feels Iike you're from a fairy tale,

783
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:30,535
and you're Iike this purity
that's just not in my Iife.

784
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,706
You are so cute.

785
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,503
Hey. This is gonna sound crazy.

786
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,340
I want you to come to Seattle with me.

787
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,969
- What?
- Yeah.

788
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,639
It's crazy, but I want you to come...

789
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:54,976
Jeff, the minute you drive out of this place,
you are not going to want to be with me.

790
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,146
That's just not true. That's what I'm saying,
I mean, do you not feel this?

791
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,982
- You're not in your right mind right now.
- I'm absolutely in my right mind.

792
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,192
This is the clearest I've been in a Iong time.

793
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,531
I've done this before.

794
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,993
- You haven't done it with me.
- No, I've done this before and I'm too old.

795
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,828
We're the same damn age.

796
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,346
That's perfect.

797
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,640
That's unbelievable.

798
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,480
Unbelievable. Okay. Great. This is good.

799
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,940
This is perfect. I'm glad you said that
'cause this was a mistake.

800
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,736
You're right. You know what?
I open up my heart to you and...

801
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,822
Thank you,
because my head was turned around...

802
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,408
- Jeff...
- But it ain't anymore.

803
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,411
I think you're being a Iittle crazy about this.

804
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,622
Yeah. I think you're crazy for saying no.

805
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,582
Please go.

806
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,464
I'm goin' by choice.

807
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,566
Why are you sitting here?

808
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,694
Why would you be sitting on your computer?
You are a young man.

809
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,072
You got the whole world ahead of you.

810
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,867
I'm asking you to be a man and try.

811
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,037
Are you ready to have a crazy night with me?
'Cause I'm ready.

812
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,373
- Say you're ready. Say you're ready.
- I'm ready.

813
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,958
My man. Good answer.

814
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,460
Let's do something stupid!

815
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,629
Stay here.

816
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,017
You guys ever partied in an Escalade?

817
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,728
Here we go. Here we go. Drink. Drink.

818
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,606
You drink. Open that up and start drinking,
I didn't buy it for nothing.

819
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:06,858
Good girl.

820
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,192
Go. Go.

821
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,654
Drink, drink, drink.

822
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,377
Arnau!

823
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,047
This guy's getting Iaid tonight.
He's my best friend!

824
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:35,720
Arnau! Pay the son of a bitch!

825
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,866
You warm enough?

826
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,329
This is all your stuff?

827
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,164
Well, I just kind of set up here,

828
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,918
the Boy Scouts don't really
come up here after September, so

829
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,087
it's kind of Iike having a second home,

830
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,715
come to spend some nights

831
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,051
and clear the head.

832
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,514
Okay. This is for you.

833
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,100
I circled the Iocation on the map,

834
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:26,187
this way you'll always know
where to find the truck and this campsite.

835
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,358
- Don't get Iost.
- Okay.

836
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:36,322
What's that? Is that a guitar?

837
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,907
No, it's called a zither.

838
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,700
Can you play this?

839
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,203
Not very well at all.

840
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,331
My dad had one, he was really good.

841
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,541
Belinda really Iiked music, so...

842
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,169
I always wished I could have
played her something,

843
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,088
so I've been writing her this song
for when I see her again.

844
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,798
Will you play it?

845
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,717
- It's...
- Please?

846
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:01,055
No, it's not finished
and it's really just not very good, so...

847
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,224
Well, I'll tell you if it's good or not.

848
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,643
Okay.

849
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,813
It's only halfway done, so it's just Iike...

850
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,625
Stand straight

851
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,962
Fall back in Iine

852
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,507
Comb your hair

853
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,343
Get to work on time

854
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:46,225
Everyone in the big machine

855
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,979
Tries to break your heart

856
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,773
And pull you underneath

857
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,402
Maybe I'm wrong

858
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:00,823
And all that you get is what you see

859
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,284
Maybe I'm right

860
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:08,205
And there's something out there to believe

861
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,585
Everybody's talking in their sleep

862
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,466
They push a lot of air around

863
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,885
But don't say much of anything

864
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,264
Except when they laugh at me

865
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,391
Like ghosts under a sheet

866
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:36,400
Everybody's talking in their sleep

867
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,823
I messed up a bunch of parts,

868
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,117
- but that's basically what it is.
- No, it's so good.

869
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,535
Shut up.

870
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,121
So good.

871
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,377
Thanks.

872
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:58,756
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Anyway, you cold?

873
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:07,515
Trust me. Trust me.

874
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,269
Now, feel this.

875
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,108
It works, right?

876
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,221
What are you doing in the Iobby?

877
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,514
Are they still in there?

878
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,850
Yeah, that's the point. She's still in there.

879
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,602
- You go.
- What do you mean I go?

880
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,063
I didn't want to hang out with these three.
I did it for you!

881
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:57,815
I don't think so. It's fine. You go.

882
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,609
- Are you gay?
- What? No...

883
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,695
- Is that what this is?
- No.

884
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,613
I'm asking you seriously,
I'm not judging you.

885
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,740
You don't know this about me,
but I don't care about that stuff.

886
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,534
No, Jeff, I'm not gay, no.

887
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,870
This is set up perfectly.
Do you not think she's hot?

888
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,955
- You're acting Iike it's so easy.
- Because it is so easy.

889
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,583
- No, Jeff. It's easy for you, not for me.
- Why not?

890
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:19,462
Because I'm not you, Jeff.
Do you just wanna see me get embarrassed?

891
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:21,672
No!

892
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,758
Arnau, come here, man. Come here.

893
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,845
Fucking come here.
I'm not pranking you, man.

894
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:31,098
You're not gonna get this opportunity
very much Ionger.

895
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:34,185
You're not always gonna be 21, young man.

896
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,479
I promise you fucking that.

897
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:40,316
I don't know. I don't know what to...
How do I start?

898
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,568
First of all, take these pedophile glasses off

899
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,529
and don't wear these,
they make you Iook Iike a weirdo, man.

900
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,324
I'm gonna put these on you. Holy shit!

901
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:49,992
Look at that killer.

902
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,702
That dude right there crushes chicks.

903
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,622
I would take a photo of you and show you
how good you Iooked right now,

904
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,915
'cause you Iook fantastic.

905
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,292
- You Iook Iike a damn pilot.
- Okay.

906
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,711
Like a cool pilot who drives jets.

907
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,047
Pop this shit.

908
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:07,384
Act Iike you've been there before.

909
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,386
You're not gonna be your age forever.

910
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,388
One day, you're gonna be the old dirtbag.

911
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:15,309
AII by yourself.
This is the moment you Iive for.

912
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,393
- Okay.
- Okay?

913
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,187
Okay.

914
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,235
Hey, Halloween, you smoke?

915
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,826
- Yeah.
- Jeff, what the fuck?

916
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,786
It's so early, Bridget.

917
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,831
Yeah, I'm working here.
Isn't that what you're doing down there?

918
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,125
Yes. That's what I'm doing.

919
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,296
I've been going over the notes
that you've been sending in.

920
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,967
This Belinda St. Sing,
the ex-girlfriend he said died in an accident.

921
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,677
Is that her name?

922
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,971
Yeah, that's right. Why?

923
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,362
You're past curfew.

924
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,948
- Were those girls with you?
- 100 % Arnau.

925
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:38,661
Hey, you know that girl your boyfriend
was going back in time to save, Belinda?

926
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:39,745
Yeah?

927
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:43,957
Well, she's alive and well.
Lives about an hour away.

928
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,630
How? What do you mean?

929
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,382
Bridget called and set up an interview.

930
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,218
I think your Iittle boyfriend is seriously nuts.

931
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,145
Yeah, I know, he's totally nuts.

932
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,064
He's completely crazy. I know.

933
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,400
So she's alive. Okay.

934
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,696
- I wanna do the interview.
- That's fine.

935
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:24,581
You sure you got this, kiddo?

936
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,543
Yeah?

937
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,813
- Darius?
- Hi.

938
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,108
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

939
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,735
Come on in.

940
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,571
I've never been interviewed
by a magazine before.

941
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,158
He worked at Anderson's,

942
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,785
which was the restaurant I waited at
all throughout college,

943
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,704
and he was really nice.

944
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:08,417
Different just than the typical guys, I guess.

945
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,169
So how Iong were you guys together?

946
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,507
Well, we were never really together, together.

947
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,594
You never dated?

948
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,431
I mean, I wouldn't call it dating. He was...

949
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:25,976
He was one of those guys, who

950
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,145
you kind of know has a crush on you,

951
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,940
but he's really nice
and so you're really nice back.

952
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:36,987
But he wasn't the type of guy
who you could easily

953
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,992
fit into your Iife, you know,
with your friends and everything.

954
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:43,660
He was

955
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:48,791
weird, I guess we've all
had one of those guys, right?

956
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,837
Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean.

957
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:58,842
So, then what happened?
Do you guys still talk?

958
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,928
After that, I started dating Rob,

959
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:04,139
who was my Iast boyfriend
before I met my husband,

960
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:07,434
and then Kenneth quit the restaurant.

961
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:11,063
I didn't see him for a while after that.

962
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,106
Then there was the accident.

963
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:16,610
Accident?

964
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,657
Kenneth ran his car
into my boyfriend's house.

965
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,826
There was a big dent
under the kitchen window.

966
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:24,952
My God!

967
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,539
So I convinced Rob to just Iet him go
and we...

968
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,291
We told the police it was a hit and run.

969
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,838
I haven't seen him since then.
But you said you've seen him recently.

970
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:37,881
How is he?

971
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,553
He's good.

972
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,363
Excuse me. Darius?

973
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:04,658
Can we have a moment of your time?

974
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:06,827
Nothing to be alarmed about.

975
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,079
We'd just Iike to ask a few questions
about Kenneth Calloway.

976
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,499
Guys? We're from Seattle Magazine.

977
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,334
We're just here doing a story on this guy.

978
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,670
We're not involved
with what he's involved with.

979
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,838
What do you want with him?

980
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,507
He's been contacting government scientists
on the Internet,

981
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:24,011
asking questions
about our particle accelerator in Berkeley.

982
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,512
We've been investigating Calloway

983
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,598
for a couple of years now
and we suspect him of being an agent.

984
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,765
He can't be a spy.

985
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:32,352
He was arrested in Colorado for
breaking into a nuclear physics Iaboratory.

986
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,606
And then there was the recent robbery
at a medical research center here.

987
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:36,940
Oh, yeah? And what did he take?

988
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,903
Are you sure it was him
that broke into the medical research place?

989
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,070
You have evidence?

990
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:43,906
We're confident.

991
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,617
He hasn't been back to his house
in the past 24 hours.

992
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,118
Give us a call if you hear from him?

993
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,620
Will do.

994
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,456
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

995
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,294
So, what's your story about?

996
01:10:58,421 --> 01:10:59,755
The story.

997
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,300
I don't know anymore, actually.

998
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:09,973
You all right?

999
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,605
You sure?

1000
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,275
Yeah.

1001
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,994
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

1002
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,134
Kenneth?

1003
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,682
Kenneth? I'm coming in.

1004
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,734
Darius?

1005
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,403
Hey. What are you doing here?

1006
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,282
Everything's set.

1007
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,993
We move the machine to the Iaunch site.
Departure is at 5:00 p.m.

1008
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:56,163
How'd you get in here anyway? The spooks
are all over me. It's crazy out there.

1009
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,581
I had to sneak in through the back.

1010
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,417
Hey, we need to talk.

1011
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,755
About Iast night. I know.

1012
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,051
Last night

1013
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,720
was a thunderbolt.

1014
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,681
But I realize

1015
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,642
our working relationship
became complicated,

1016
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:22,230
so for now, maybe we just
re-focus and concentrate on the mission.

1017
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,565
Whose house is this?

1018
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:28,070
It's my house. My parents Ieft it to me.

1019
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,405
Where are the Iasers?
Can you show me the Iasers?

1020
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,116
What's wrong with your voice?

1021
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,536
- Where's the time machine?
- The time machine is at the Iaunch site.

1022
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,163
Oh, right, it's at the Iaunch site.

1023
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,456
Darius.

1024
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:42,959
What are you doing?

1025
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,129
I talked to those guys who are following you.

1026
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,508
And they told me
that you stole those Iasers because

1027
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,260
you're some kind of spy or something.

1028
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:57,933
That's perfect. Let them think that,
it works in our favor. It's better. Seriously.

1029
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,268
I also talked to Belinda.

1030
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,980
- What?
- Yeah.

1031
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,691
- You did not talk to Belinda.
- Yeah, I did.

1032
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,568
I talked to Belinda. I was just at her house.

1033
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:09,986
No! No!

1034
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,448
What are you doing?

1035
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,290
She's alive! She's alive! Okay.

1036
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:24,668
This is good. Okay.

1037
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:29,631
This means the mission must have
been successful, and we have saved her

1038
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,633
- and we've come back to the present...
- Hey, hey...

1039
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:35,428
Hey, you can be honest with me, okay?

1040
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,348
- I really Iike you.
- Okay.

1041
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:40,267
Yes. But this is the thing.

1042
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:43,895
It's a complicated science
and cannot be measured by our brains...

1043
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,438
You can't time travel!

1044
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,984
This is all crazy. Okay, you Iied to me.

1045
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,528
- Listen to me.
- What else are you Iying about?

1046
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:53,738
Hey, hey, Iisten to me.

1047
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,826
You come to that Iaunch site at 5:00 p.m.,

1048
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,789
you take my hand
and I'll show you who can't time travel.

1049
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,670
Oh, shit!

1050
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,009
AII right?

1051
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:17,179
Darius! They're right behind the house!

1052
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,014
- Wait...
- They're right behind me.

1053
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,640
Wait, you're with that guy?

1054
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,685
- Are you...
- No.

1055
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:26,271
- Were you making fun of me?
- No, I would have never...

1056
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,647
Nobody was making fun of you, Kenneth.

1057
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,066
We are writing an honest piece
about you for a magazine.

1058
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,902
Magazine? Darius, don't...

1059
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:34,154
- We're not making fun of you.
- Get out of my house!

1060
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,073
- We're on your side. We're here to help.
- No, I'm Ieaving tonight!

1061
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,630
So is he really building
a time machine or what?

1062
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:52,964
Why did you make me do this?

1063
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,342
I didn't make you do this.
You wanted the story.

1064
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,636
You don't care about the story!
You don't care about him.

1065
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,512
You just came here
to hook up with old girlfriends.

1066
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,890
- What's going on?
- Hey, guys, check this out.

1067
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,099
It's open.

1068
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,739
Watch your head.

1069
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:23,203
I know what they were Iooking for.
I saw it, it was Iike a,

1070
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,080
Iike a jet engine or something.

1071
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,926
It's gone!

1072
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,724
Darius, have you seen this stuff before?

1073
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,482
What the hell was he building in here?

1074
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,486
I don't know.

1075
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,993
You don't think he actually built it, do you?

1076
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,161
Holy shit!

1077
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,006
Move!

1078
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:21,970
Darius!

1079
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,585
Kenneth, I'm sorry.

1080
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:37,879
Were you making a joke of me
the whole time?

1081
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,756
No.

1082
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,050
I promise.

1083
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,597
I Iied about the story, but everything else
was real, okay? That was really me.

1084
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:57,982
Then get on.

1085
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,407
Come with me.

1086
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,972
The mission's been updated.

1087
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,100
I'm going back for you now.

1088
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,105
AII right. You trust me?

1089
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:43,820
Come on.

1090
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:50,285
Take my hand. I know what I'm doing, okay?

1091
01:19:56,292 --> 01:20:00,003
Flip that switch. Do it. Flip it down.

1092
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:23,359
Are you ready?

1093
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,555
Go!

1094
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,296
...to go it alone or to go with a partner.

1095
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:29,634
When you choose a partner, you have to
have compromises and sacrifices,

1096
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:30,885
but it's the price you pay.

1097
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:34,514
Do I wanna follow my every whim and desire
as I make my way through time and space?

1098
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:35,598
Absolutely.

1099
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:39,477
But at the end of the day, do I
need someone when I'm doubting myself,

1100
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,563
and I'm insecure and my heart's failing me?

1101
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:44,983
Do I need someone who,
when the heat gets hot, has my back?

1102
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:48,111
- So, do you?
- I do.
