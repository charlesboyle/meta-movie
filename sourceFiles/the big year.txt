a sledgehammer to this.

512
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,344
I'm supposed to put my
life on hold for a year?

513
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,307
Like a pathetic
golf widow?

514
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:18,138
You're not a golf widow.
You can't compare golf to this.

515
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,642
Golf's just like a hobby.

516
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,940
And the birding
is what exactly?

517
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,486
I don't know, it's like a calling.
This is like my calling.

518
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,817
Like Gandhi?

519
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:32,527
No, come on. I'm not comparing
myself to Gandhi, okay?

520
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:37,490
That's ridiculous. Okay?
It's more like I'm Mozart, I guess.

521
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,999
Okay, fine. You got a calling.
I got a calling, too.

522
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,625
It's known <i>as</i> a baby.
Yeah.

523
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:48,676
I know. I like to think that that's
like another one of my callings, too.

524
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,720
And you're gonna have to contribute,
you realize, eventually.

525
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,047
I realize.
In person.

526
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,100
Yes. In person.
I wouldn't want it any other way.

527
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,225
Really? 'Cause I ain't
so sure, Wolfgang.

528
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:03,057
Maybe I can
convince you.

529
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,483
I didn't mean now.

530
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,815
Come on. What's
the matter with now?

531
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,026
'Cause we have a house
full of men.

532

Really? After being outside

No, it's my pleasure.

666
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,340
Look, when I'm birding, I don't
fly first class or hire guides.

667

It's too much like corked
bats and steroids to me.

we're celebrating.

01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:14,918
755?

1694
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:17,129
Son of a bitch!
I... That's...

1695
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:19,593
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

1696
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:20,798
That's shocking.

1697
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:22,350
I know,
it's not quite human.

1698
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,098
But you are second!
How amazing is that?

1699
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:27,476
A full-time job
and you're second?

1700
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:30,975
And? You're third?

1701
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:32,981
Fourth. What can I say?

1702
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:35,067
I waited
too long to do it.

1703
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,443
<i>No, you didn't.
Don't say that.</i>

1704
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:38,820
Then you would have done it
some other year.

1705
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,653
And really, we won.

1706
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,154
What do you mean?

1707
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,869
We won, Stu!
I don't know how else to put it.

1708
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,585
<i>I don't just mean I wouldn't have
come in second without you.</i>

1709
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,957
<i>Although that's true</i>

1710
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:56,043
I mean, I don't know, he got more
birds, but we got more everything.

1711
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:58,424
Do you know
what I mean?

1712
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,174
Yeah, I do.

1713
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:07,266
Thank you, Stu.
Have I said thank you?

1714
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,063
Hey, for what?

1715
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:11,816
Congrats.
Take care, buddy.

1716
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:15,853
Yep.

1717
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,652
Looks like you'll be
spending the weekend

1718
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,859
with the second best
birder in the world.

1719
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,120
(SQUEALING EXCITEDLY)

1720
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:36,541
Bostick!

1721
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,547
(SNICKERING)

1722
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:42,346
<i>NARRATOR: Eight weeks later,

1724
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:49,596
<i>She hopes
it will be uneventful.</i>

1725
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,228

1728
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,279
That's a male goldfinch.

1729
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:05,077
In a couple of months,
it's gonna turn all yellow.
