James Bond
Never Say Never Again

1
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,330
<i># You walk in a room. #</i>

2
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,880
<i># A woman can feel the heat. #</i>

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,960
<i># One look is a guarantee. #</i>

4
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,680
<i># Nights could be long and sweet. #</i>

5
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,220
<i># The message is clear. #</i>

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,890
<i># Like nothing I've ever known. #</i>

7
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,900
<i># But from all that I hear. #</i>

8
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,730
<i># Forget about long-range plans. #</i>

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,190
<i># 'Cause this man's got his own. #</i>

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,950
<i># To get mixed up with. #</i>

11
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,660
<i># A man who says never. #</i>

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,710
<i># May be big trouble, but then #</i>

13
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:37,760
<i># I just could be the woman to take you. #</i>

14
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,930
<i># And make you never say never again. #</i>

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,640
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

16
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,400
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,150
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

18
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,700
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

19
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,410
<i># You've got all the moves. #</i>

20
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,960
<i># No matter your attitude or your mood #</i>

21
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,710
<i># I'll come through. #</i>

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,470
<i># The touch of your voice. #</i>

23
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,220
<i># The feel of your eyes on me. #</i>

24
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,970
<i># You leave me no choice. #</i>

25
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,810
<i># Though I know there's danger there #</i>

26
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,230
<i># I don't care, let it be. #</i>

27
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,070
<i># To get in bed with. #</i>

28
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,200
<i># A man who says never. #</i>

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,790
<i># May have no future, but then #</i>

30
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:54,750
<i># I just could be the woman to reach you. #</i>

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,180
<i># And teach you to never say never again #</i>

32
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,930
<i># I'll beg you I'll get you #</i>

33
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,730
<i># I'll reach you I'll teach you #</i>

34
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,610
<i># I'll take you I'll make you. #</i>

35
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,810
One minute, 47 seconds, sir.

36
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,320
Not too shabby, sir.

37
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,360
But dead, 007. Dead!

38
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,030
You should have studied
the plot more carefully.

39
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,660
Fanatical revolutionaries
kidnap a millionaire's daughter

40
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,120
and hold her captive for eight weeks.

41
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,120
Of course she could have been brainwashed.

42
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,120
Could have turned.

43
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,250
Evidently she did.

44
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,330
With due respect, sir,

45
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,880
I played your war games for two
weeks and I only got killed once.

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Twice.

47
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,170
You've forgotten the land
mine on the Black Sea beach.

48
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,010
Correction, sir. I lost both legs.
I did not die.

49
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,890
You were immobilized.

50
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,980
It can never be the same
playing with blanks.

51
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,390
It is somewhat different in the field.

52
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,060
With your life on the line, you...

53
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,940
Well, your adrenaline gives you an edge.

54
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,980
But is your edge sharp enough?

55
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,490
That's the difference between
a double-0 and a corpse.

56
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,950
Since you took over, sir, you've
had little use for the double-0's.

57
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,870
I've spent most of my
time teaching, not doing.

58
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,330
I'll make you no secret.

59
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,210
I hold your methods in much less regard
than my illustrious predecessor did.

60
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,920
But my duty is to keep you up to par.

61
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,340
Too many free radicals,
that's your problem.

62
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,590
Free radicals, sir?

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,100
Yeah, they're toxins that
destroy the body and the brain.

64
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,560
Caused by eating too much
red meat and white bread

65
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,690
and too many dry martinis.

66
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,310
Then I shall cut out the white bread, sir.

67
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,860
You'll do more than that, 007.

68
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,110
From now on, you will be suffering a
strict regimen of diet and exercise.

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,780
We shall purge those toxins from you.

70
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,620
Shrublands? You've got it.

71
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,040
Have you got an assignment, James?

72
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,130
Yes. Yes, Moneypenny.

73
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm to eliminate all free radicals.

74
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,800
Oh!

75
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,590
Do be careful.

76
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,550
Come on, now. Keep up with me.

77
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,440
Welcome to Shrublands, sir.

78
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,570
Thank you.

79
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,070
My word. They don't make
them like this anymore.

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,610
You're right.

81
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,120
It's still in pretty good shape.

82
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,870
This way, sir.

83
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,870
Your body's got enough scar
tissue for an entire regiment.

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,750
Right. But it's still in pretty good shape.

85
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,090
We'll be the judge of that, Mr. Bond.

86
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,920
Our job is not just to rehabilitate you.
It's to re-educate you.

87
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,180
I want to open your mind to the virtues of
nutrition, proper exercise, meditation,

88
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,720
and, hopefully, spiritual enlightenment.

89
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,020
I'd like you to see the iridologist
at 4:00, have a colonic at 5:00,

90
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,020
and then you can cut along
to the light-dining room

91
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,900
and have a refreshing cup of parsley tea.

92
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,110
Mr. Bond, I need a urine sample.

93
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,490
If you could fill this beaker for me.

94
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,910
From here?

95
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,750
Box 274 and quickly, please.

96
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,930
We have invested extensively

97
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,270
in the Middle East and Central America

98
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,350
to promote insurgency and revolution.

99
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,190
Fortunately, our capital outlay
has been handsomely offset

100
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,320
by the resultant sales of
armaments and missiles.

101
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,000
You will note that we have supplied
both rebels and government forces

102
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,750
on an equal basis.

103
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,210
In matters of death, SPECTRE
is strictly impartial.

104
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,590
Now for the future.

105
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,840
SPECTRE's most audacious enterprise of any,

106
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,220
next to which our previous
ventures are inconsequential.

107
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,270
Our esteemed Number One is in complete
charge of the entire operation,

108
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,270
which will henceforth be
called "The Tears of Allah."

109
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,190
He will now join us.

110
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,700
According to plans, an
American Air Force officer

111
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,410
has been introduced to a
cruel mistress, heroin.

112
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,920
I understand he is now our
willing and obedient servant.

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,550
A surgical operation has
been performed on him.

114
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,420
As a result of a corneal implant,

115
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,800
his right eye print is now an exact replica

116
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,810
of that of the President
of the United States.

117
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,810
He will soon be moved to a
convalescent clinic near London.

118
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,110
I have chosen Number 12 to
have the responsibility

119
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:17,700
of taking the most tender loving
care of Captain Jack Petachi.

120
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,210
I beg your pardon.

121
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,370
Is there no speed limit here?

122
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,040
She's not staff. She must be
one of those private nurses.

123
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,510
My name is Bond.

124
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,130
You're Mr. Bond. I believe I'm
having you in half an hour.

125
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,760
Splendid! Your room or mine?

126
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,760
Mine.

127
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,150
That's it. Okay, now just move
back on the couch for me, please.

128
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,480
That's it. Right. Now, let's
have this arm on the shoulder.

129
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,030
This one... No, underneath there.
That's good.

130
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,950
Okay, now just relax.

131
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,380
Yes, there are slight lesions
of the thoracic vertebrae.

132
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,420
Now, just hold still.

133
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,430
Yes. Some sacroiliac strain
at the base of the spine.

134
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,140
You know, there is a more beneficial
therapy for a man's lower back.

135
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,390
Oh, really? And what might that be?

136
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,230
I thought I'd surprise you, James.

137
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,100
Well, you have. Come in.

138
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,060
No, no, no, no. I can't come in.

139
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,900
You know if they found me here
they'd fire me on the spot.

140
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,150
I won't let anyone find you. Don't worry.

141
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,910
I have my reputation to think of.

142
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,120
I don't think you got your reputation
by living on a diet of wild rice.

143
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,830
So, lentil delight. Dandelion salad.

144
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,870
Goat's cheese.

145
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,050
Beluga caviar. Quail's eggs. Vodka.

146
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,880
Foie gras.

147
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,970
Strasbourg.

148
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,460
Jack's been smoking again!

149
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,720
Jack was ordered not to smoke.

150
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,480
Smoking is dirty.

151
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,440
It gets into Jack's eye.

152
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,450
Jack must do as he's told if he wants
his fast cars and his pretty clothes.

153
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,700
And if he wants to keep his
sister alive, he's got to...

154
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,030
You leave Domino out of this!

155
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,920
James?

156
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,520
Get up!

157
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,820
Now let's just take a look, shall we?

158
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,620
Very good.

159
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,130
With a contact lens, both eyes
will look exactly the same.

160
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:48,880
Now, darling must do his little
trickie in eight seconds.

161
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,680
Then nursie will give baby his candy.

162
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,830
P-3-4-1.

163
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,260
Come on, Jack.

164
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,970
Oh, damn.

165
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,380
Try it again, darling!

166
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,600
- Who's that?
- A man!

167
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,230
At the window!

168
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,400
Don't move.

169
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,820
Did he see you?

170
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,070
I don't know.

171
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,240
I guess he could have.

172
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,870
Do you know him?

173
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,670
Oh, yes. 007.

174
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,470
- Good morning, Mr. Bond.
- Good morning.

175
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,220
Miss Fearing tells me you're
making fine progress.

176
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,060
Oh, yes.

177
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,810
But I must say, you're looking
a bit peaked this morning.

178
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,230
I was up all night.

179
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,480
Don't overdo it.

180
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,940
A herbal enema should fix you up.

181
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,900
Thank you.

182
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,070
Sounds terrific.

183
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,660
I'll be done in a minute.

184
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,100
Heavy, Mr. Bond?

185
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,400
Let's try again.

186
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,880
You lunatics.

187
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,550
I send you to a health farm
to get yourself in shape.

188
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,390
Instead you demolish it.

189
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,180
I've had to notify the local police,
pull out the special branch,

190
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,850
get the minister to muzzle the press

191
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,190
and allocate a sizeable
chunk of my meager budget

192
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,070
to renovating the establishment!

193
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,860
A man did try to kill me, sir.

194
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,030
No, caught you seducing his wife, did he?

195
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,450
No, sir, not at all.

196
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,320
But in fact, I lost four pounds,

197
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,540
and God knows how many free radicals.

198
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,080
That is the kind of attitude that
tempts me to suspend you, 007!

199
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,880
Now, this test is to assess
distance and accuracy

200
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,850
of cruise-missile release
from the support country.

201
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,480
Now, these ALCMs with dummy warheads
will go from terrain following,

202
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,810
to inertial guidance, over
water, toward the target.

203
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,310
We hope.

204
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,730
Stand by.

205
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,190
Countdown is go for dummy
warhead loading and B-1 flight.

206
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,700
Let's hope we never have to use
the real thing. Good luck.

207
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,030
All right, men. This is it.
Let's make it a good one.

208
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,450
1-0-1, Depot One.

209
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,700
Mr. President, please stand by

210
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:06,250
while authority for this procedure
is confirmed by eye-print check.

211
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,380
If confirmation is not authenticated
within eight seconds,

212
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,750
the base will be sealed.

213
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,720
Eight, seven, six, five...

214
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,890
Come on... four, three, two...

215
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,140
Come on.

216
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,770
One. Thank you.

217
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,100
Presidential authority is confirmed
for change of test procedure.

218
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,530
Dummy warheads will be replaced
by W80 thermonuclear device.

219
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,280
Have a nice day.

220
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,540
Jack!

221
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,550
Bravo!

222
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,480
Oh, no! No!

223
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,180
Oh!

224
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,930
My poor angel. My sweet baby.

225
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,250
Mr. Kovacs, how much longer?

226
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,040
They're coming. They're almost in range.

227
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,990
Range safety officer to base. Alert.

228
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,110
Radar confirms both missiles
on descent trajectory. Repeat.

229
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,450
What the hell's going on here?

230
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,950
They've got maximum thrust,
but they're still going down.

231
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,290
About to cross minimum cruise height.

232
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,540
Descending below minimum cruise height.

233
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,790
Damn! We've lost them.

234
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,400
We've got them.

235
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,110
Well, Kovacs?

236
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,530
The fish are netted.

237
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,200
Put them on ice.

238
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,290
I am supreme commander of SPECTRE,

239
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,090
the Special Executive

240
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,550
for Counterintelligence,

241
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,380
Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.

242
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,930
Yesterday morning,

243
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,010
the American Air Force
launched two cruise missiles

244
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,680
from Swadley airbase in Great Britain.

245
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,900
Through the ingenuity of SPECTRE,
the dummy warheads they carried

246
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,110
were replaced with live nuclear warheads.

247
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,740
Your weapons of destruction are
now safely in our possession

248
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,030
and will be moved to two secret targets.

249
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,870
Please note the serial
numbers of the missiles.

250
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,420
They will confirm the truth.

251
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,840
Your weapons of deterrence did
not deter us from our objective.

252
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,260
A terrible catastrophe now confronts you.

253
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:19,060
However, it can be avoided by paying
a tribute to our organization,

254
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,190
amounting to 25o/o of your respective
countries' annual oil purchases.

255
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,770
We have accomplished two of the functions

256
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:34,030
that the name SPECTRE embodies,
terror and extortion.

257
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:38,120
If our demands are not
met within seven days,

258
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,580
we shall ruthlessly apply
the third, revenge.

259
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,720
That would be $25 billion a year!

260
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,930
Order, gentlemen, please. Order!

261
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,440
These demands would destabilize
the monetary system!

262
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,230
I call this meeting to order!

263
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,950
The foreign secretary wishes to address you!
Lord Ambrose.

264
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,990
Gentlemen, we are faced with
the ultimate nightmare,

265
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,290
the abduction of nuclear warheads.

266
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,750
But how is this possible?

267
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,420
Up to this point, our fail-safe
procedures relating to nuclear hardware

268
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,800
have been absolutely foolproof.

269
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,760
I hope the American government realizes

270
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,350
its awesome responsibility in this matter.

271
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:44,140
NATO has a joint responsibility
to solve this problem, gentlemen.

272
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,480
But if this gets out, it
will cause worldwide panic.

273
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,360
How well has this
information been contained?

274
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,820
Apart from those present in this room,

275
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,700
the information resides only with
the CIA and British Intelligence.

276
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,240
Wonderful. That means by now
it's all over the Kremlin.

277
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:09,210
I know your feelings, M, but I insist
you reactivate the double-0's.

278
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,920
As you wish, sir.

279
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,680
Maximilian Largo, born Bucharest, 1945.

280
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,060
Industrialist and philanthropist.

281
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,150
Resident Nassau, Bahamas. No
known criminal activities...

282
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,230
Here you are.

283
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,480
You still here, Moneypenny?
You should be in bed.

284
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,320
James, we both should be.

285
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,410
Instead I'm looking everywhere for you.

286
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,620
Forget that.

287
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,870
M wants to see you right now.
It's panic stations upstairs.

288
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,080
He's been with the Prime Minister all day.

289
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,500
I think you're back in business, James.

290
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,580
Welcome home.

291
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,250
Good morning, gentlemen.

292
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,050
Morning. Morning.

293
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,590
- The latest reports?
- Everything okay?

294
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,760
Yes, sir.

295
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,390
Good morning.

296
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,970
Good morning, Charles.

297
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,650
In absolute secrecy, the Americans
are trying to trace the missile

298
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,990
that's on their eastern seaboard.

299
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,860
The other allegedly threatens the
oilfields of the Middle East.

300
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,530
How well protected are they from the air?

301
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Everyone's collaborating. The
Americans, NATO, the Japanese.

302
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,040
They're putting up an air screen
a mosquito couldn't get through.

303
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,210
Our concern is that the warhead
may already be in position.

304
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,880
The worst devastation would result
from a subterranean explosion.

305
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,970
You see, the oil-bearing
strata in the area,

306
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,180
interconnected by a surprisingly
delicate structure...

307
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,600
It would be a sort of ripple effect.

308
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,860
What's the Americans' story on
how the damn things were stolen?

309
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,020
The release of ALCMs has to come
from the President himself.

310
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,780
Even that has safeguards.

311
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,950
It can only be authorized after
a scan of his right eye.

312
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,330
The only irregularity they've discovered
is that a communications officer

313
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,620
unofficially left the base
at the time of the launch.

314
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,250
A certain Captain Jack Petachi.

315
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,750
If this Petachi was involved,

316
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,170
is it conceivable that he
could have used a false eye?

317
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,840
Do come along, Bond.

318
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,550
Let's think of a more logical
explanation, shall we?

319
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,150
Okay, let's run through that routine
we were working on yesterday...

320
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,660
It'll make you strong.

321
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,790
There.

322
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,870
Let's go again.

323
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Okay.

324
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,710
Four, five, six, seven, down.

325
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,300
Come on, now.

326
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,560
Max!

327
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,030
As usual, I have left you
alone too long. I know.

328
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,830
But I brought you a gift.

329
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,370
I don't want any more gifts.

330
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,330
I just want you. That's all I want.

331
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,670
I know, but this is different.

332
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,500
Look. Max.

333
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,710
Look.

334
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,050
What is it?

335
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,550
It's very old.

336
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,480
What's the inscription?

337
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,850
Arabic. The Tears of Allah.

338
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,030
The story is that the Prophet wept
for the barrenness of the desert,

339
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,570
and his tears made a well.

340
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:33,200
It's a legend, of course,
but like all great legends,

341
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,120
it is also the truth.

342
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,500
It is the most valuable thing

343
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,470
I have ever possessed. Except you.

344
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,680
And you trust me to wear it?

345
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,230
A safer place than around your
neck, I couldn't imagine.

346
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,980
And what if I ever leave you?

347
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,740
No, really!

348
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,700
Then I cut your throat.

349
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,540
Nice to know even old Q can surprise

350
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,620
one of you double-0's occasionally.

351
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,420
Algernon.

352
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,710
Not quite perfected yet.

353
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,050
You could write a very
binding contract with this.

354
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,810
Yeah, I wish I had a new contract.

355
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,970
They've slashed my budget, you see.

356
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,810
You can't get the spare parts.

357
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,270
And when you can, there's usually
some strike that stops delivery.

358
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,570
And look at this place. They keep
it bloody freezing down here.

359
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,650
Plays havoc with my sinuses.

360
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,030
We're both humble servants
of the Crown, Algy.

361
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,200
If the CIA made me an offer,
I'd be off like a shot.

362
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,490
Unlimited resources, air conditioning,

363
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,410
28 flavors of ice cream in the restaurant.

364
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,330
It's a motorbike toy.

365
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,670
If I can get the thing to work
properly, I'll ship it out to you.

366
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,720
Wait a minute. I've got something
in here that could be useful.

367
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,890
The prototype came from a KGB defector.

368
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,680
Bit of a whiz kid in
their technical section.

369
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,350
Not a bad chap, though like all
defectors, prone to melancholy.

370
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,770
I suppose it's all that
vodka and English weather.

371
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,320
Rather tasty, this is. It looks like
a watch, but it's really a laser.

372
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,780
Keeps perfect time.

373
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,070
But for how long?

374
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,540
At least your lifetime.

375
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,410
Good to see you, Mr. Bond.

376
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,330
Things have been awfully dull round here.

377
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,460
Bureaucrats running the old place,
everything done by the book.

378
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,010
Can't make a decision unless the
computer gives you the go-ahead.

379
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,470
Now you're on this,

380
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,510
I hope we're going to have some
gratuitous sex and violence.

381
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,770
I certainly hope so, too. What is this for?

382
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,390
I'll show you.

383
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
You unscrew it, then stick it up your nose.

384
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,730
It's for my sinus.

385
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,610
Well, I won't need one of
these where I'm going.

386
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,400
Where's that?

387
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,320
Or are you not allowed to say?

388
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,950
The Bahamas.

389
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,830
Lucky bloody you!

390
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,900
Sorry.

391
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,400
That's perfectly all right.

392
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,570
What are you hoping to catch?

393
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,830
Something about 6'2", 190
pounds, with brown eyes.

394
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,160
Well, why bother going to sea?

395
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,790
Let me help you.

396
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,170
Mr. Bond!

397
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,630
I say, Mr. Bond!

398
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,470
Catch you later, perhaps.

399
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,720
Right.

400
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,220
Nigel Small-Fawcett,
British embassy, Nassau.

401
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,060
How do you do, Nigel?

402
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,520
Sorry I'm late.

403
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,230
But as you're one of these
undercover johnnies,

404
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,860
I took the precaution
of not being followed.

405
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,860
And that's why you shouted
my name across the harbor?

406
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,450
Oh, God, did I? I'm sorry.

407
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,580
Damn. Damn!

408
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,620
Sorry. I'm rather new to all this.

409
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,540
What's the score with Largo?

410
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,750
He's highly visible in these parts.

411
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,630
Enormously wealthy. Owns the
biggest boat in the Caribbean.

412
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,720
Spends a lot of his time at a
place called Bluebeard Reef.

413
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,680
Marine archeology, I gather.

414
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,720
You've met him?

415
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,260
Oh, yes. He's charming.

416
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,850
I mean, foreign, but charming nonetheless.

417
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,440
He donates a lot of money to worthy causes.

418
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,480
He built a maritime museum and
a new wing for the orphanage.

419
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,440
I'm sure he's very kind to his mother.

420
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,440
Don't know his mother.

421
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,530
You're not going to make any
trouble, are you, Mr. Bond?

422
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,200
Let's face it, your
reputation has preceded you.

423
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,330
Do I look like the sort of
man who would make trouble?

424
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,580
Well, yes, frankly.

425
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,370
And you're going to
jeopardize the tourist trade

426
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,380
if you start going around killing people.

427
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,250
Nigel, please. Just go back to your desk.

428
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,010
Find out where Largo's
boat is at the moment.

429
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,300
Call me later. I'll be at my hotel.

430
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,090
Jolly good. I'll get onto that at once.

431
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,270
And take full advantage
of the natural cover.

432
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,740
Is this the Flying Saucer?

433
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,070
Yeah. It sailed this morning.

434
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,750
How reckless of me. I made you all wet.

435
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,170
Yes, but my martini's still dry.
My name's James.

436
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,430
Hello, James. I'm Fatima Blush.

437
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,600
You ski very well.

438
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,970
I do many things very well.

439
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,640
I'm sure you do.

440
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,980
What brings you to Nassau, James?

441
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,400
I'm fishing.

442
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,610
For what?

443
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,690
Anything I can get.

444
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,700
I know the best waters.

445
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,200
I'd be very happy to show them to you.

446
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,950
Now, why would you want to do that?

447
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,040
I'd like you to find
what you're looking for.

448
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,250
I'm all yours.

449
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,720
Yes?

450
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,090
James, would you come down please?

451
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,550
Right away.

452
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,820
I think this should take
care of you perfectly.

453
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,570
I'm sure it will.

454
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,400
You're marvelously well-equipped.

455
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,110
Thank you, James.

456
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,200
So are you.

457
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,620
Thank you.

458
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,830
What exactly are we going down for?

459
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,090
Sport and a little fun.

460
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,340
You appear tense.

461
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,130
You affect me, James.

462
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,970
Well, that's bad.

463
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,180
Going down, one should always be relaxed.

464
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,860
Is it far to the reef?

465
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,480
It's far enough.

466
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,610
We've got time to kill.

467
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,240
It's you.

468
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,200
Well, you did say you'd catch me later.

469
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,440
Oh, my God.

470
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,650
623 and...

471
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,780
728.

472
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,990
728.

473
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,240
Here you are. No messages.

474
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,440
Hello?

475
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,610
Mr. Bond, I've finally tracked you down.

476
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,950
Small-Fawcett here.

477
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,990
I hope I haven't caught
you at an awkward moment.

478
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,660
No, not at all. Just be brief.

479
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,290
I don't have too much time.

480
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,170
Just want you to know that
I'm on top of things.

481
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:46,090
I've found out that Largo's boat is
en route for the south of France.

482
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,960
Well done.

483
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,090
It was nothing, really.

484
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,800
If you're free tomorrow, why
don't we go snorkeling?

485
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,260
Sounds a wonderful idea.

486
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,180
Jolly good, Bond!

487
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,230
Because I was wanting
to discuss with you...

488
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,400
What's that?

489
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,610
Mr. Bond?

490
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,110
Proof that we made the right decision.

491
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,200
About what, darling?

492
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,030
Your place or mine.

493
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,630
I found a villa for us just
where you wanted. It's perfect.

494
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,920
The Flying Saucer is
anchored in the bay below.

495
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,630
And Q sent this.

496
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,260
Thank you.

497
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,690
- Catch!
- Get down!

498
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,770
- Felix.
- Not bad.

499
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,940
Not bad at all. Nothing
wrong with your reflexes.

500
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,110
How you doing, buddy?

501
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,360
What the hell are you doing here?

502
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:38,030
CIA sent me to ride shotgun with you.

503
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,740
- 326.
- How do you do?

504
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,080
Excuse my inexperience. Nicole.

505
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,750
I'm Felix Leiter. Enchant.

506
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:47,080
Thank you. My car is right there.

507
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,670
I ran some checks in the Langley computer.

508
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:50,880
Anything on Largo?

509
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,800
No, he's squeaky clean.

510
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,050
I must say, for once, your
hunch was wrong, buddy.

511
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,720
- Algernon, right?
- Yes.

512
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,640
I had the first one of those
things, and it blew up in my face.

513
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,270
A motorbike came for you from England.
Here's the papers.

514
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,650
What are you gonna do with this bike?

515
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,110
I won't know until I test it.

516
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,950
It's gonna be your ass, James.

517
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,410
Thank you.

518
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,200
Felix?

519
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,320
Yeah.

520
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,990
Forget the soup.

521
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,330
Feast your eyes on that.

522
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,250
What've you got here, James?

523
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,630
That's Largo's lady.

524
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,380
Her name is Domino. Domino Petachi.

525
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:20,550
Petachi. The Air Force officer
killed in that car crash.

526
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,590
Jack Petachi.

527
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,850
That's right. He was her brother.

528
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,730
Well, there's the man himself.

529
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:31,150
If he's got the bombs, do you think
he'd have them on his yacht?

530
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:34,270
Unlikely. But get some scuba gear.

531
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,570
We'll check her out.

532
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:36,820
Right.

533
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,450
Welcome to the Centre de la Sant.

534
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,120
I hope you enjoy our facilities.

535
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,130
Do you serve men here?

536
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,880
But of course.

537
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,010
Some men more than others.

538
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:23,550
Miss Petachi. No one told me
you were here. I am sorry.

539
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,010
You speak English, yes?

540
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,930
Yes. Quite well, in fact.

541
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:32,680
Now, hard or soft massage?

542
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:35,520
Hard, please.

543
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,690
Well, perhaps we should
begin with your back.

544
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:50,700
I don't believe we've seen
you around here before.

545
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,910
No, I was on a boat.

546
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:59,420
And what boat would that be?

547
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,170
The Flying Saucer.

548
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,550
Mr. Largo's boat.

549
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,090
Yes. Do you know Mr. Largo?

550
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,510
I know of him.

551
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,720
I know he owns many beautiful things.

552
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,900
Yes, he's a very generous man, Mr. Largo.

553
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,320
I'm sure he is.

554
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,400
He's giving a charity ball tonight
at the casino, for children.

555
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,280
What a worthy cause.

556
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,910
Perhaps I should attend.

557
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,790
I'd really like to ask you. I would.

558
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:39,830
But I'm afraid the guest list
is very restricted. I'm sorry.

559
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,170
C'est la vie.

560
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,930
C'est la vie?

561
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,640
Such is life.

562
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,850
Such is life.

563
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,700
That feels so good.

564
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,530
Certainly does.

565
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:15,200
Excuse me?

566
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,460
It certainly does need it.

567
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:22,040
You have slight lesions
in the upper vertebrae.

568
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:35,100
Could you go a little lower, please?

569
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,480
Lower?

570
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,730
Yes, please.

571
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,810
Please.

572
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,730
Right there.

573
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,240
That feels so good.

574
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:02,370
I am sorry, mademoiselle.
We are so very busy today.

575
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,380
Where'd the masseur go?

576
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,630
Who?

577
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,170
The man, the...

578
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:11,180
The man I pass? He does not work here.

579
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,540
They'll never let you in.
I'd better wait for you.

580
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,200
No, Nicole. You go back to the villa.

581
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,630
Find that villa.

582
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,850
Wait a minute! You there!

583
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,490
I shouldn't have the fish.

584
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:25,170
You must have an unreasonable fear of
gatecrashers to carry this heavy artillery.

585
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,760
This bomb has a tiny gyroscope inside.

586
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,170
Any lateral movement on your part

587
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,590
and you could be served in an egg cup.

588
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,430
If you understand what's being
explained to you, nod gently.

589
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:46,020
Good boy. Stay.

590
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:58,400
Hello again. I do owe you an explanation.

591
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:01,070
My name is Bond. James Bond.

592
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,830
May I offer you a drink?

593
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,470
Hard or soft?

594
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:23,930
Soft.

595
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:27,180
I'll have a double Bloody Mary with
plenty of Worcestershire sauce.

596
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,220
Hate to think what you mean by hard.

597
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,770
Vodka on the rocks for me.

598
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,290
I think you have lost her.

599
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,500
Can you actually imagine
that I could lose a woman

600
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,290
to a underpaid British agent?

601
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,460
Yeah?

602
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,840
Yeah.

603
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,670
And I warn you, if he's
not executed at once,

604
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,390
he'll have your Domino turned over.

605
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:08,470
Is it possible that you
have bungled your attempts

606
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,140
because you want him for yourself?

607
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,070
Maximilian.

608
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,530
Why torture yourself
over that kind of woman?

609
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:23,610
Maybe one day you'll have
to kill her, Fatima.

610
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,740
Your sense of humor is delicious.

611
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,660
What's your brother up to these days?

612
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:36,120
He's on his way here. I
can't wait to see him.

613
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,290
How do you know my brother?

614
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,460
Hello!

615
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,880
You must be Mr. James Bond, right?

616
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,590
Monsieur Largo.

617
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:49,300
Yes, right. Are you a man who enjoys games?

618
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:52,640
Depends with whom I'm playing.

619
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,270
Yeah. Shall we? Join us.

620
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,490
These are my friends. They honored
me by coming from all over the world

621
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,780
to lose their money for
my favorite charity.

622
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,910
And what might that be?

623
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:09,030
Children. Orphan children.

624
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,080
So, here we are.

625
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,670
The game is called Domination.
I designed it myself.

626
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:23,550
But my problem is I've never
yet found a worthy adversary.

627
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:26,300
No doubt I shall disappoint you, too.

628
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,640
We'll see.

629
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,350
Darling?

630
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:41,060
This game has one objective, power.

631
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:49,240
We will be fighting for countries,
chosen at random by the machine.

632
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:53,740
But for this demonstration,
I will choose France.

633
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,910
Target areas will light up on the map.

634
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,250
Whoever hits them first with his
laser beam will score a point.

635
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,460
But there is another way to win.

636
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:07,010
With your left hand, you
control two nuclear missiles.

637
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:10,930
With your right hand, you control
a shield to block my missiles.

638
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:15,100
But if you fail... Boom, I win the game.

639
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,730
You will be red. I will be blue.

640
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,150
Are you ready?

641
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:22,440
Yes.

642
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,280
Begin.

643
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,320
Thank you, gentlemen.

644
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,280
Eternal battle for the
domination of the world begins.

645
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,910
We play for dollars.

646
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,290
Random target selection, Spain.

647
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:38,370
Value $9,000.

648
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,120
Play.

649
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,430
Blue wins $9,000.

650
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,010
Gave me a shock.

651
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,640
I'm sorry. I forgot.

652
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,680
Unlike armchair generals, we will
share the pain of our soldiers

653
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,730
in the form of electric shocks.

654
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:02,730
One last point,

655
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,110
if you let go of the controls,
you forfeit the game.

656
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:11,820
As you were unaware of
this, we will begin again.

657
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,910
Reset. Thank you.

658
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,710
Random target selection, Japan.

659
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:23,880
Value, $16,000.

660
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,380
Play.

661
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,590
Excuse me. Excuse me.

662
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:45,020
Blue wins $16,000.

663
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:48,690
A lucky move on my part.
Perhaps I didn't explain.

664
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,490
As the stakes increase, so
does the level of pain.

665
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:55,620
Rather like life. We continue?

666
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:01,000
Of course.

667
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,580
Good.

668
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,090
Eternal battle for the
domination of the world begins.

669
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,880
Random target selection, the United States.

670
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,550
Value, $42,000. Play.

671
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,120
Red pain level at 50o/o.

672
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,830
Danger level. Repeat. Danger level.

673
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:57,680
60%.

674
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:00,220
65%.

675
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:09,440
Red pain level, 80o/o. Danger. Danger.

676
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,190
Danger.

677
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,110
Domino.

678
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,320
Excuse me.

679
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,210
Are you all right?

680
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,340
Fine.

681
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:39,390
You lost $58,000.

682
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:42,430
It goes, of course, to my charity.

683
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,640
I think it's better if we don't continue.

684
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:54,070
Can we play one more game
for the rest of the world?

685
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,700
Win or lose?

686
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,910
You know what that could mean?

687
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,420
Yes.

688
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,580
Good.

689
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,640
Best of luck.

690
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,770
You, too.

691
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:28,890
Final game. Remaining
countries of the world.

692
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:31,440
Value, $325,000.

693
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:33,770
Play.

694
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,710
Blue missile destroyed.
Blue pain level, 50%.

695
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,130
Danger level. Repeat. Danger level.

696
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,470
Second blue missile destroyed.

697
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:09,810
Blue pain level, 55%. Danger.

698
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:10,890
Max.

699
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,060
65%.

700
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:16,070
Blue pain level, 70%.

701
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,900
Pain level at 80%. Max.

702
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,160
85%. Danger. Danger.

703
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,700
Max. Danger.

704
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,670
Excuse me.

705
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:42,220
It seems I underestimated you.

706
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:48,970
$267,000.

707
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,810
I'll settle for one dance with Domino.

708
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,020
So...

709
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,480
Do you lose as gracefully as you win?

710
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,190
I wouldn't know. I've never lost.

711
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,610
This game has been played

712
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,530
and I have lost. That's it.

713
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,500
He's never gone this far before.

714
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,750
He's certifiable.

715
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:14,920
A tango, yes?

716
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,200
What is it you're after?

717
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,870
In part, it's about your brother.

718
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,750
What about my brother?

719
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,840
Did you know that your brother
was working for Largo?

720
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,260
That's impossible. Jack is in the U.S.
Air Force.

721
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,970
That's precisely why Largo used him.

722
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,230
Your brother's dead.

723
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,060
Keep dancing. Largo is the prime suspect.

724
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,940
Your brother was used and then eliminated.

725
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,170
They move well together, don't they?

726
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,180
Today you have another chance.

727
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:51,890
This time you'd better not fail.

728
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:53,310
Number 12.

729
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,260
Excellent.

730
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:30,340
You dance amazingly well, Mr. Bond.

731
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,850
It's Domino, really.

732
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,180
She's such a pleasure to follow.

733
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,260
I know.

734
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:36,600
I'd love to have you for lunch.

735
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,600
If you are still around tomorrow,

736
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,850
why don't you join us on our boat?

737
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,110
Tomorrow's not good for me.

738
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:43,360
Why?

739
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,860
I'm going to pick up Jack.

740
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,280
No. That's not possible.

741
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,280
Jack phoned earlier to say
he'd been delayed again.

742
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,990
At least for another week, maybe two.

743
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:55,580
Bye-bye.

744
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,380
Thank you very much.

745
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,950
Nicole?

746
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,620
Nicole.

747
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:37,260
Don't touch him! He's mine!

748
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:18,010
Come on, come on! Come on, come on!

749
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:15,160
Hold it.

750
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,880
Sit up.

751
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,010
Your gun.

752
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,600
Carefully.

753
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:41,440
Over here.

754
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:48,910
Spread your legs.

755
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:58,670
Good. Very good.

756
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:04,130
You're quite a man, Mr. James Bond.

757
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,970
But I am a superior woman.

758
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:13,970
Guess where you get the first one.

759
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,560
Well, in view of your hatred of men...

760
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:19,850
Liar!

761
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:25,650
You know that making love to Fatima was
the greatest pleasure of your life.

762
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,570
Well, to be perfectly honest,

763
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,160
there was this girl in Philadelphia...

764
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,870
Shut up!

765
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,250
I am the best.

766
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:38,580
Yes. Yes, you're right.

767
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,880
In fact, I was going to put you
in my memoirs as number one.

768
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:45,840
Write.

769
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:59,350
Write.

770
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,990
Now write this.

771
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:16,950
The greatest rapture in my life was
afforded me in a boat in Nassau

772
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,790
by Fatima Blush.

773
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:25,630
Signed James Bond, 007.

774
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:31,300
I just remembered.

775
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:35,140
It's against service policy for
agents to give out endorsements.

776
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:36,390
Write!

777
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:40,810
Right now?

778
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:42,690
Right now.

779
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:18,180
Not perfected yet.

780
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:39,160
Good show, James. Q actually
came through, didn't he?

781
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,580
How long have you been here?

782
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,290
Long enough.

783
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:43,540
Long enough for what?

784
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,830
To see how you handled the lady.

785
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,380
You did rather well.

786
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,250
Come on. This way.

787
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,980
Monsieur Largo is waiting for you, sir.

788
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,150
Of course. Thank you.

789
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,250
This way, sir.

790
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:19,030
Hello.

791
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:22,360
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

792
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:23,700
You are a bit early for lunch.

793
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:24,990
I know. It's rather embarrassing.

794
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,830
Prepare for departure.

795
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:31,080
Steward, get some clothes for my guest.

796
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:32,500
I'm overwhelmed.

797
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,090
I'm invited for lunch and given a cruise.

798
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:36,750
Why? You had other plans?

799
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,880
No, not at all. I'm at your disposal.

800
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,800
Of course. Cigarette?

801
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,050
No, not today, thank you.

802
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,010
So...

803
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,140
A drink? A vodka martini?

804
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,730
Of course.

805
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:10,830
This is my situation room.

806
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:12,790
From here, the world comes to me.

807
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,080
You could run a small government from here.

808
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:18,960
Oh, no, I could run a large
government from here.

809
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:20,420
What's your latest venture?

810
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:22,090
Oil.

811
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,300
It's a new departure for me,

812
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:28,060
besides which all my other enterprises
are of little consequence.

813
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:32,520
Well, if it's that big, let's hope
it doesn't blow up in your face.

814
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:37,110
Mr. Bond. Excuse me. I have work to do.
Time is money.

815
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:40,230
By the way, the staterooms are aft.

816
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:46,200
Don't forget, 12:00. Lunch.

817
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:53,500
Mr. Bond, enjoy the ship.

818
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:25,900
Mr. Bond!

819
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:30,160
There's some fresh clothes
in your cabin, sir.

820
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,540
If you'd like to follow me.

821
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:32,910
Thank you.

822
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:54,680
What happened to my brother?

823
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:55,930
Why are you here?

824
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:57,190
Just trust me.

825
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:33,140
The Tears of Allah.

826
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,270
Does that mean anything to you?

827
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:47,240
This is it. He gave it to me.

828
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,820
He said it was very valuable.

829
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:51,490
It doesn't look it.

830
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,910
Have you any idea where we're heading?

831
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,580
North Africa.

832
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,290
He's got a house, a place called Palmyra.

833
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:05,670
Somehow I've got to transmit
a message out of here.

834
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,170
It could be risky, but I'm
going to need your help.

835
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:11,090
What do you want me to do?

836
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:12,930
I'm going to kiss you.

837
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:15,470
I want you to respond as if you liked it.

838
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,020
I'm doing this for two very good reasons.

839
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:21,730
One, because I'm hoping
to provoke a reaction.

840
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,520
And the other one?

841
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:26,730
Because I always wanted to.

842
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:05,000
False alarm! False alarm!

843
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:08,340
All crew return to stations.

844
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:13,880
We've just picked up a message
from one of our ships in the Med.

845
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:15,680
I think it's from Bond, sir.

846
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,760
About time.

847
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:20,220
Yes. He used our emergency
code Tango Zebra.

848
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:22,640
"Heading North Africa, Palmyra."

849
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,430
Palmyra? Where is that?

850
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,310
Haven't a clue, sir.

851
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,980
Well, find out about it, will you?

852
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:32,320
I'll do my best, sir.

853
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:34,240
North Africa?

854
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,040
Quite impressive, huh?

855
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:49,500
Very.

856
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:53,590
That's my retreat, where I can
escape and enjoy all my treasures.

857
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:17,360
How do you like your new home, my princess?

858
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:38,220
Bond, the game is over. Take him away.

859
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:58,240
That belonged to Napoleon's empress.

860
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:03,280
That is my greatest treasure.

861
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:09,040
Take it. Take it. But be careful.

862
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:16,670
That is your wedding present.

863
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:23,760
You betrayed me.

864
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:27,020
But I forgive you.

865
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,520
And what about my brother?

866
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:35,690
Your brother...

867
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:41,950
I hate you. I hate you.

868
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:55,000
Domino! Domino!

869
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:58,510
You're crazy.

870
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:01,470
Yeah, maybe I'm crazy.

871
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,580
What a wonderful view.

872
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,410
You'll see.

873
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:22,420
Every game has to have a winner.
So... Ciao bello.

874
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:25,760
Largo.

875
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,050
Bond.

876
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:30,220
In that case, where did you hide the bombs?

877
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,480
You still think of escape?

878
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,690
I must say, I admire your spirit.

879
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,650
Well,

880
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:44,360
bomb number one is right
under the President's feet

881
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,280
in Washington DC.

882
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,240
And number two?

883
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:57,920
You were a very good secret agent. Really.

884
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:01,960
Bye.

885
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:24,280
I'm sure this will amuse you.

886
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,210
Goodbye, Domino.

887
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:17,260
Cover it up.

888
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:13,230
Hold on.

889
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:14,570
What are you doing?

890
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,070
James!

891
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:19,090
Bond, you're a hard man to keep up with.

892
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:21,170
Clear the line to Washington, Felix.

893
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:23,550
That's where the first bomb is.

894
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:47,830
It was never like this
when I was in the Navy.

895
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,370
Here we are.

896
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:02,050
What's the matter?

897
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:06,840
You're going back after Largo, aren't you?

898
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:09,350
Well, I have to.

899
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:17,610
I want him as much as you do.

900
01:50:17,690 --> 01:50:19,440
Probably more.

901
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:21,230
I can understand you hating him.

902
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:32,450
Maybe I don't hate him
enough to risk losing you.

903
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:37,630
But I don't want to risk losing me, either.

904
01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:45,800
Commander Bond, the Washington
bomb has been located and defused.

905
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:49,430
Now, sir, from London, your
chief wants to speak to you.

906
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:53,730
This is M. We've cracked the
code for disarming the warheads,

907
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:57,850
but we've only got five hours
to find the second bomb.

908
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,810
Now, as you perfectly well know,

909
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:03,030
I have absolute confidence in you, and I...

910
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:05,150
That's what kept me going, sir.

911
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:07,530
Bond, all right, then,
I'll be brief with you.

912
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:09,910
And I know you've got your hands full.

913
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:14,250
If you should come through
this fearful ordeal unscathed,

914
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:18,170
I'd like to offer you
lunch at my club. Over.

915
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:22,670
That's a thrilling prospect, sir.

916
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:25,090
But if I do get through this,

917
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,720
I may have other plans.

918
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:42,360
Steady at 300.

919
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:43,730
Steady at 300.

920
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,400
There she is, sir.

921
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:47,900
What's she reading?

922
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:49,860
Seven fathoms, sir.

923
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,530
No way we can get in there.

924
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:53,200
The water's too shallow.

925
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:58,080
Nothing. Nothing moving on board.

926
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:02,670
AWAC surveillance reports
no sightings on shore.

927
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,340
Now why did Largo anchor here?

928
01:52:10,050 --> 01:52:12,390
Your pendant. Give it to me.

929
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:20,770
This is The Tears of Allah.

930
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:24,820
The story goes that the Prophet
wept, and his tears made a well.

931
01:52:27,150 --> 01:52:29,650
The contours are the same.

932
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:32,490
The diamond must mark a place.

933
01:52:32,570 --> 01:52:34,580
That would be about here.

934
01:52:36,330 --> 01:52:38,660
Right where the oilfields begin.

935
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,000
Sir, there is underwater
activity in the area.

936
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,960
Check the area for underwater caves.

937
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,210
Right, sir.

938
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:44,560
Sonar signals do indicate
a cavity below sea level

939
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:47,190
at 015 degrees.

940
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,150
There's an underground river right there.

941
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:35,660
Commander Pederson, are you
equipped with the new XT-7Bs?

942
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:39,080
That's top secret. How
do you know about them?

943
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:44,330
From a Russian translation of
one of your service manuals.

944
01:54:44,410 --> 01:54:46,040
Sorry about that.

945
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:54,010
Ports open. Fire one.

946
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:57,300
Fire two. Cut track.

947
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:04,470
Be careful of the housing.

948
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:24,910
Watch it.

949
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:05,280
I've got to go in.

950
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:07,450
We don't have much time.

951
01:58:07,530 --> 01:58:09,870
Give the sub our position
and get some help.

952
01:58:09,950 --> 01:58:11,290
All right.

953
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:13,470
Kovacs? Kovacs? Come.

954
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:16,520
You're not in the right place. Please.

955
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,980
Well done, Dr. Kovacs.

956
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,770
Go ahead. Go ahead.

957
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:26,740
When the warhead is ready for its
final voyage, we will drink a toast.

958
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:29,070
There is nothing that can stop us anymore.

959
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:50,800
The guide rope. Keep the tension.

960
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:16,540
The Tears of Allah.

961
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,960
Sweet, like money.

962
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:27,380
For centuries, this has
been a monument to power,

963
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:29,550
but nothing like what we now possess.

964
02:00:29,630 --> 02:00:31,140
Huh, Kovacs?

965
02:00:56,910 --> 02:00:59,830
Everybody stay undercover!
You, get up there!

966
02:01:36,660 --> 02:01:38,330
Leiter, stay down!

967
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:44,420
What took you so long?

968
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:46,130
Hold up on the heavy stuff!

969
02:01:46,210 --> 02:01:47,750
Bond is still in there!

970
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:22,580
It's armed.

971
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:59,590
Largo got away with the warhead.

972
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:01,760
Call down a chopper.

973
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:03,890
I'm going to try the oasis. Good luck.

974
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:06,680
Bond's clear! We're moving in!

975
02:08:32,450 --> 02:08:33,830
There you are.

976
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:36,040
I always have a martini at 5:00.

977
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:39,460
You'll never give up
your old habits, James.

978
02:08:39,540 --> 02:08:43,130
No, you're wrong. Those days are over.

979
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:24,920
Oh, no.

980
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,420
I'm sorry, Mr. Bond.

981
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:29,260
Obviously caught you at a bad moment.

982
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:30,920
M sent you.

983
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:33,180
Only to plead for your return, sir.

984
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:35,390
M says that without you in the service,

985
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:38,600
he fears for the security
of the civilized world.

986
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:40,060
Never again.

987
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:42,310
Never?

988
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:45,310
<i># Never say never again. #</i>

989
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:49,150
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

990
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:11,970
<i># You walk in a room. #</i>

991
02:10:12,050 --> 02:10:15,470
<i># A woman can feel the heat. #</i>

992
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:18,850
<i># One look is a guarantee. #</i>

993
02:10:18,930 --> 02:10:23,350
<i># Nights could be long and sweet. #</i>

994
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:26,350
<i># The message is clear. #</i>

995
02:10:26,690 --> 02:10:30,650
<i># Like nothing I've ever known. #</i>

996
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:34,070
<i># But from all that I hear. #</i>

997
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:37,410
<i># Forget about long-range plans. #</i>

998
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:41,870
<i># 'Cause this man's got his own. #</i>

999
02:10:41,950 --> 02:10:45,710
<i># To get mixed up with. #</i>

1000
02:10:45,790 --> 02:10:49,500
<i># A man who says never. #</i>

1001
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:57,300
<i># May be big trouble, but then #</i>

1002
02:10:57,510 --> 02:11:04,480
<i># I just could be the woman to take you. #</i>

1003
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:10,480
<i># And make you never say never again. #</i>

1004
02:11:10,570 --> 02:11:14,190
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

1005
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:17,910
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

1006
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:21,620
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

1007
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:25,500
<i># Never, never say never again. #</i>

1008
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:28,960
<i># You've got all the moves. #</i>

1009
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:32,750
<i># Oh, but, baby, I got them, too. #</i>

1010
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:37,590
<i># No matter your attitude or your mood #</i>

1011
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:40,390
<i># I'll come through. #</i>

1012
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:43,930
<i># The touch of your voice. #</i>

1013
02:11:44,020 --> 02:11:47,640
<i># The feel of your eyes on me. #</i>

1014
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:51,150
<i># You leave me no choice. #</i>

1015
02:11:51,820 --> 02:11:54,570
<i># Though I know there's danger there #</i>

1016
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:59,070
<i># I don't care, let it be. #</i>

1017
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:02,780
<i># To get in bed with. #</i>

1018
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:06,660
<i># A man who says never. #</i>

1019
02:12:07,870 --> 02:12:14,550

1020
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:21,550
<i># I just could be the woman to reach you. #</i>

1021
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:28,020

1022
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:32,650
<i># I'll beg you I'll get you #</i>

1023
02:12:32,730 --> 02:12:36,400
<i># I'll reach you I'll teach you #</i>

1024
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:40,490
<i># I'll take you I'll make you #</i>
