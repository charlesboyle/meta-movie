15
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,700
What I do requires
a certain mindset.

16
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,460
I do assignments,

17
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
designated targets.

18
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,740
Some jobs need to look
like accidents.

19
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,340
Others must cast suspicion
on someone else.

20
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,460
A select few need to send
a clear message.

21
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,100
Pulling a trigger is easy.

22
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,580
The best jobs are the ones nobody
even knows you were there.

23
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,300
Liquor fairy paid me
a visit last night.

24
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,580
Left me a big old bottle of Scotch.

25
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,500
He even sprung for the good stuff.

26
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,700
See you, Henry.

27
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,900
Why the fuck do I let you drag
me out to this shit hole?

28
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,100
You're a snob, Harry.

29
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,220
Eleven hundred people come
through here every day.

30
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,780
Hard to remember two fellows
passing through.

31
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,020
Thank you.

32
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,700
Of course, people might
remember them.

33
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,460
Yeah.

34
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,620
Then that kind of defeats
your purpose.

35
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,060
I don't go anywhere without
them. Nowhere.

36
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,580
Try to get them shoes that fit.
They look like cartoons.

37
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,060
Everything went okay?

38
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,220
It got done.

39
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,020
There's no one better
than you, you know.

40
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,700
That's why they give you those
jobs that could get hairy

41
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,180
because if they were to get hairy,
then you would take care of it,

42
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,100
and that's all they care about,
services rendered, no loose ends.

43
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,540
Fait accompli.

44
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,540
You're a goddamn machine.

45
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,220
You see things.

46
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,740
You view people differently than I
do, differently than anybody does.

47
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,300
Yeah, but you've got
a problem, Arthur.

48
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,380
You need companionship.

49
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,060
I have you, Harry.

50
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,260
Oh, then you're in deeper
shit than I thought.

51
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,980
So how's Steven?

52
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,780
Did I tell you that I got him a
job at a private security firm?

53
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,620
They kicked him out last month.
He beat some guy half to death.

54
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,620
Goddamn disappointment.

55
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
Always has been, always will be.

56
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,540
Call him.

57
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,340
Me? Call him?

58
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,540
For what?

59
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,220
He probably needs to hear from you.

60
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,500
Yeah.

61
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Let's go. I'll get your money.

62
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,620
Come on. Dance with me.

63
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,500
Come on, please?

64
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,180
You hungry?

65
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,300
Sure.

66
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,460
I gotta go.

67
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,100
Okay.

68
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,420
You ever gonna tell me your name?

69
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,620
Arthur.

70
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,260
Nice try.

71
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,780
But you're no Arthur.

72
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,860
No, more like a David.

73
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,460
Or Brad. Hmm.

74
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,180
Yeah.

75
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,100
See you, Brad.

76
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,660
Yeah, I know. Whoo!

77
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,540
Yeah.

78
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,660
Global Engineering.

79
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm calling about the ad.

80
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,340
There must be a mistake.

81
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,580
One moment, please.

82
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,220
The advertisement was proofed.
The information is accurate.

83
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,660
I want a meeting.

84
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,300
We'll get back to you.

85
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,820
Mr. Bishop, Mr. Dean has
agreed to a meeting.

86
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,060
A private jet will pick
you up in one hour

87
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,300
and deliver you to a site
of his choosing.

88
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,260
You'll be allowed 15 minutes.
The jet will then return you.

89
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,540
When we tell you to be home at
10:00, we mean 10, not 11 :30.

90
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,340
I don't care, baby. You scared
your mother to death.

91
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,900
You're grounded for two
weeks. Just one second.

92
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,980
Well, that's not my problem.

93
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
All right, look.

94
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,020
Ten days and you volunteer two
Saturdays at the shelter.

95
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,380
Eight days and three Saturdays.

96
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,740
-Nice ring.
-Done.

97
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,380
Where do I get one of those?

98
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,540
You can't. Unless you're
a world champion.

99
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,900
Just tell him to come
out and fix it, honey.

100
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,580
All right, let's go.

101
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,860
I've just been out-negotiated
by a 16 year old.

102
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,700
Let's take a walk.

103
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,260
Six months ago, we were 
commissioned to undertake

104
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,660
the largest contract 
we've ever attempted.

105
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,900
The target was far more 
high-profile than we're normally

106
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,820
comfortable with

107
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,020
but the job was just
too rich to pass up.

108
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,140
-The target was South African? 
-The target fled to South Africa.

109
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,620
That's where we made 
our move, in Cape Town.

110
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
It took six months to set up.

111
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,060
I assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission.

112
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,380
All five were killed.

113
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,380
Someone knew everything.

114
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,340
You probably knew some 
of the men on that team.

115
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,980
I knew this one. Sebastian.

116
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,220
You know how this
company works, Mr. Bishop.

117
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,180
Only two partners know the
details of any given job.

118
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,900
Two people knew the details here.

119
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,900
Me and Harry McKenna.

120
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,820
Harry sold us out.

121
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,500
We pulled his financials.

122
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,220
Take a look at recent
offshore deposits.

123
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,580
There's one there made two weeks
ago for 20 million U.S. dollars.

124
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,820
He's gotten old.

125
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,420
He's gotten weak.

126
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,300
He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his costly, troubled son.

127
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,660
They made him vulnerable.

128
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,500
And for the past 13 years, I have
been fiercely loyal to him.

129
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,900
There's no one I respected more.

130
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,540
But Harry McKenna has
poisoned the well.

131
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,820
He needs to be removed.
Immediately.

132
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,500
Let me talk to him.

133
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Look, I appreciate your
connection with Harry,

134
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,460
but there's no turning back here.

135
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,620
He has crossed his Rubicon.

136
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,580
Every day that he's alive puts
this company in danger.

137
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,820
I know we would all prefer
that you handle this.

138
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,380
Given your relationship,

139
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,020
you're in the best position to get
this done quickly and discreetly.

140
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,060
And to be honest with you,
I hate the idea of Harry

141
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,460
suffering unnecessarily.

142
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,100
We don't wanna go to
an outside source.

143
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,820
But we will if we have to.

144
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,780
Excuse me a sec.

145
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,100
Jess, negotiations are
closed. I'm sorry.

146
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,340
I'm in a meeting. Okay,
hang on a sec.

147
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,620
Forty-eight hours or we'll
proceed without you.

148
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,620
Hey, squirt?

149
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,420
Remember the expression,
"Quit while you're ahead"?

150
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,140
Yeah, I mean, Roosevelt, to
be truthful, is my hero.

151
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,420
I mean, the way he dealt
with his damn chair.

152
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,540
Jasper, pull your trousers
up, will you? Please?

153
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,220
Pull your trousers up.

154
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,500
You know, the suits don't really
fit you guys very well.

155
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,100
- Yeah?
- Get out of the building, Harry.

156
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,500
- Arthur?
- They're coming for you tonight.

157
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,380
Who? Who's coming?

158
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,660
Dean.

159
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,300
Take whatever you can use
against them and get out.

160
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,620
Oh, Jesus.

161
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,580
Do you have a pair of scissors?

162
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,020
Yeah.

163
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,460
- Go to the elevator lobby.
- On my way.

164
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,140
Looks like we got a power outage
on the 18th floor.

165
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,380
You have 15 seconds
to get to the service elevator

166
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,380
before the emergency
power comes on.

167
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,820
-There's a keypad. 
-Punch in the building number.

168
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,140
We cut the power off.

169
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,580
Service elevators have to work
on a separate power source.

170
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,780
I'm in.

171
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,380
Press the basement floor.

172
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,380
The elevator will take 18
seconds to get there.

173
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,820
The level is empty and
unused. Take the ramp.

174
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,420
It connects to the building
next door. It leads to an

175
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,100
underground parking lot.

176
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,740
Shit.

177
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,940
Security cameras haven't been
fitted in this building

178
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,500
yet, so they'll be blind.

179
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,780
Okay, you should be entering
the parking lot now.

180
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,980
My van's here.

181
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,500
I left it there.

182
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,660
Oh, shit.

183
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,580
Well, you got me to circumvent
my own security.

184
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,340
Nobody sees me leave.

185
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,300
So, what's this?

186
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,780
Cape Town, right?

187
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,700
Yeah. Right.

188
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,260
So, what's the story here?

189
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,140
Carjacking?

190
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,660
Police will find my van somewhere
in some shit hole

191
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,060
section of the city,

192
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,900
stripped and up on blocks?

193
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,620
Something like that.

194
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,540
Well, a slight editorial revision.

195
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,660
You don't mind, do you?

196
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,980
Yeah, I get off a couple of
shots, there's a struggle,

197
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,580
they get my gun, c'est la vie.

198
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,700
At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

199
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,900
I've had that for 33 years.

200
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,380
Gift from Admiral Beasley.
Sixth Fleet.

201
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,260
That's the first time I ever fired it.

202
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,740
Why didn't you kill me?

203
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,060
Ah.

204
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,900
They'd just send somebody else.

205
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,620
I would rather it was you, Arthur.

206
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,620
You'll have to live with it.

207
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,980
Arthur fucking Bishop.

208
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,220
Sorry for your loss.

209
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,900
More of a loss for you
than me, buddy.

210
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
It's a long time.

211
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,100
Hey, would you give me a ride
to my father's house?

212
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,420
Your father talked about you a lot.

213
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,620
He talked about spending time
with you, maybe making up.

214
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,060
Give it a rest, would you?

215
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,700
Yeah, well, he was always
bringing you up.

216
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,660
He had regrets, Steven.

217
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,380
Yeah, he could have picked
up the phone anytime.

218
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,980
I wanna show you something.

219
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,020
I loved this place as a kid.

220
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,380
It's pretty impressive, huh?

221
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,780
Every one of them served
their country.

222
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,780
I guess I could still enlist.

223
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,380
You know, make him proud.

224
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,940
I'm fucking with you.

225
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I don't know if you have
a picture of him,

226
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
but I thought maybe
you'd, you know,

227
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,620
want one.

228
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,180
Looks like you're not planning
on sticking around.

229
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,820
For what?

230
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,180
He didn't leave a will.

231
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,220
Accounts are empty. Bank's
gonna take the house.

232
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,740
By the time the lawyers, city and
state get through with the rest,

233
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,860
not gonna be a fucking thing left.

234
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,060
Where you headed?

235
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Next place.

236
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,220
Need some money?

237
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,500
No, thanks.

238
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,060
I got a guy coming to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

239
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,580
I figure that'll probably get me
through along to the next spot.

240
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,060
What about the guns?

241
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,700
I was thinking about going out

242
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,940
and killing myself a couple
carjackers tonight.

243
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,940
Just any old run-of-the-mill
carjacker.

244
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,380
Yeah, well, you never know.

245
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,260
I might get lucky, find the
guys that killed my dad.

246
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,380
It gonna make you feel better?

247
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,660
Fuck if I know.

248
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,060
But I'll find out.

249
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,620
Sleep it off, Steve.

250
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,820
Hey, Bishop?

251
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,500
What kind of person shoots someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

252
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,140
How long am I supposed to wait?

253
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,060
You know what? You
can wait until tomorrow.

254
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,740
Look, I told you to be here.

255
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,380
Yo.

256
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,500
Hey. Hey, you need some help?

257
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,380
-No, I think I got it.
-Mm. Mm.

258
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,580
I'm supposed to meet a friend
and I might have gotten

259
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,740
the address wrong.

260
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
Yeah. Maybe.

261
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,540
Well, maybe the address
got me wrong.

262
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,020
Nice car, man. Nice car.

263
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,700
Thanks.

264
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,900
-Can I have it?
-What?

265
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,420
I'm relieving you of your
automobile, motherfucker.

266
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,220
Out of the car.

267
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,220
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

268
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,420
Jesus fucking Chri... Okay.

269
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,100
Okay.

270
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,860
Mother... 

271
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,180
Carjacker.

272
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,220
Did you shoot him with this?

273
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,220
-Fuck.
-Is this the gun you used?

274
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,340
No?

275
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,940
Hey. Bad move.

276
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,700
Didn't properly think this
through, did you, Steven?

277
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,580
This may not seem like it, but
tonight's your lucky night, Raymond.

278
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,500
Anybody asks, you fell down.

279
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,500
Don't make us come looking for you.

280
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,420
Get out of here.

281
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,940
Stupid to kill someone when
you have a motive.

282
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,780
Might as well paint a bull's-eye
on your back.

283
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,620
I don't give a shit.

284
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,660
I'm aware.

285
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,460
Get out of here.

286
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,620
I was thinking about what you
were saying the other night.

287
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,500
And I wanna know what you know.

288
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,820
Go online.

289
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
It's all on the Internet.

290
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,820
But I don't wanna read it.

291
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,740
I wanna do it.

292
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,020
Do what exactly?

293
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,220
Bishop, don't bullshit me.

294
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,860
I know about you.

295
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,940
And him.

296
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,740
He was your mentor. He
chose you over me.

297
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,860
You owe him.

298
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,980
Now that he's gone, he's left me with
fucking nothing. You owe me now.

299
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,380
Go home, Steve.

300
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,100
Still for sale.

301
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,860
You know you want it.

302
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,020
No other lifetime but this.

303
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,780
Want some advice?

304
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,820
Follow what this tells you.

305
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,580
It's trying to tell you something.

306
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,580
It's telling you you're homesick
for a place you've never been.

307
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,340
8600 Alvarado
Street, 7 a.m. tomorrow.

308
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,180
What is this place?

309
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,460
It's an animal shelter.

310
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,500
Yeah, I know what it
is. Why are we here?

311
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,500
Look for a dog like this. Under
a year, if possible.

312
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,300
I would have taken you
more for a cat person.

313
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,860
You know what a mechanic is, outside
its obvious definition?

314
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,540
A guy who fixes things,
problems, has contracts.

315
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,380
A hit man.

316
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,180
I do assignments.

317
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,900
Designated targets.

318
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,820
I could do that.

319
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,340
-I've seen some shit.
-No, you haven't.

320
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,900
You know shit about me, Bishop.

321
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,860
Steven Jackson McKenna. Born
in Baltimore, Maryland.

322
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,220
Your mother died when you was 12.
A mixture of pain meds and vodka.

323
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,300
You attended three different
high schools.

324
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,740
Grant, Deer Park and Monroe.

325
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,500
Lettered in four sports, got
a scholarship from Miami

326
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,900
that was rescinded upon a
conviction of possession with

327
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,780
intent to distribute.

328
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,860
Had four misdemeanors for aggravated
assault and unlawful threats

329
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,780
against two different girlfriends.

330
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,340
Broke your kneecap in a fight.

331
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,580
Didn't wanna tell anyone, so
you let it heal on its own.

332
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,620
Now, when it rains, you
walk with a limp.

333
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,380
I'll show you the x-rays, if you like.

334
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,340
Our friend here would like to
adopt this little fellow.

335
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,500
Hello, boy.

336
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,740
What I do requires
a certain mindset.

337
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,100
Revenge is an emotion that
can get you killed.

338
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,020
So no more stupid stunts
like the other night.

339
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,900
Walk it, feed it, make
it your best friend.

340
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,140
Tomorrow, 11, Fischer Square.

341
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,620
Take the dog to the
coffee shop on Riverdale.

342
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,420
Order a coffee. Black.

343
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,100
Sit at a table by the window and do
the Sudoku puzzle in the paper.

344
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,820
Play nice with the
dog. For how long?

345
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,700
One hour.

346
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,860
Every day for the next three weeks.

347
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,300
This is yours. This is
yours. This is yours.

348
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,900
Practice on this.

349
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,100
Insurance companies know everything
about how people die.

350
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,340
They even have books
with actuaries,

351
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,460
lists of every cause
of death imaginable.

352
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,900
Why don't you just shoot
them and fuck all this?

353
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,820
Good judgment comes from experience

354
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,780
and a lot of that comes
from bad judgment.

355
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,580
Bed's under the boxes.

356
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,540
Help yourself.

357
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,180
How long you been working on it?

358
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,380
Two years.

359
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,380
It's nice.

360
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,460
When are we gonna go for a ride?

361
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,380
We?

362
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,860
Never.

363
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,620
Time to take your training
to the next level.

364
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,460
Who's that? He's good.

365
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,300
Nobody checked you out.

366
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,820
I could come back.

367
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,260
I'd rather not stand out here.

368
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,580
I gotta tell you, man. I'm a
little skittish right now.

369
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,980
Not sure if this is a good time
for me to be doing anything.

370
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,420
There's a lot of shit in
the wind, you know?

371
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,980
I brought the list and the money.

372
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,860
Now's not a good time.

373
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,780
Let me see the list.

374
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,100
All this by when?

375
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,820
As soon as possible.

376
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,060
All right.

377
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,100
Take me a day to make it happen.

378
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,780
Let me have the money.

379
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,380
Autoerotic asphyxiation? Yep.

380
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,700
Just thought you should
see one up close.

381
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,140
Don't ever touch this.

382
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,020
Follow me.

383
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,940
Who was he? A job.

384
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,060
Nothing more, nothing less.

385
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,820
Makes you feel better, he was
an illegal arms dealer.

386
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,660
Sold weapons to anyone. Cop killers,
gangbangers, terrorists.

387
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,420
He didn't discriminate.

388
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,700
Here's the file.

389
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,180
The guy from the coffee shop?

390
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,940
All yours.

391
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,620
You wouldn't know
it by looking at him,

392
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,940
but he's a mechanic
for another group.

393
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,060
His only routine is coffee every
morning from 9 to 10.

394
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,820
Doesn't go anyplace
twice except here.

395
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,220
He's insulated, protected.

396
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,140
No way in without him
seeing us coming.

397
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,380
Except he has two weaknesses.
Chihuahuas... 

398
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,860
Mind if I sit down? Please.

399
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,860
... and boys. Young boys.

400
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,700
Coffee, black. Thank you.

401
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,340
No doubt he's checked you out

402
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,780
and found no connection
to you and this world.

403
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,460
What he sees is a good-looking
kid who's kind of lost.

404
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,340
-Do you wanna hold him?
-Yeah.

405
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,940
-He likes that.
-Come here, baby.

406
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,700
If he's interested, the first
thing he'll do is ask you.

407
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,540
- So, you live around here, Steve?
- Your answer should be... 

408
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,020
I'm bouncing around.

409
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,580
Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

410
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,700
-He's my buddy.
-Yeah.

411
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Then ask you if... 

412
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,820
You wanna get a drink one evening?

413
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,700
-Your answer should be...
-Yeah.

414
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,100
Great.

415
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,800
That's great, isn't it?

416
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,499
Flunitrazepam.

417
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,340
Roofie.

418
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,180
You want me to kill him,
not rape him, right?

419
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,660
Two to three drops, he's woozy.

420
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,540
Over six, his heart stops and he's
brain dead in under three minutes.

421
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,380
Do it in the bar. Make it clean.

422
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,420
These fancy places, they always
water down the booze.

423
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,980
So I think that's why these
are going down so fast.

424
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,020
They don't water down wine,
that's for sure.

425
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,220
It's really good.

426
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,580
Want another one? Yeah.

427
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,820
Jameson, right? Jameson,
double, please.

428
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,220
Right.

429
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,260
Don't mess around
with this guy. Do it in

430
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,420
the bar, make it clean.

431
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,500
I wanna know what
you know. I wanna do it.

432
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,180
What?

433
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,180
What's funny? No, nothing's funny.

434
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,500
I'm just, I think I've had
too many. No, come on.

435
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,620
No, I think I'm gonna
finish this one... 

436
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,140
I'm gonna finish this one
and then I'm gonna... 

437
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,580
I really should go to bed. But
it was very... It was fun.

438
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,140
Steve.

439
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,860
Hey.

440
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,940
-You all right?
-Yeah.

441
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,580
-How are you?
-I'm good, man.

442
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,740
Hey, can I give you
a ride someplace?

443
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,740
Car's right here.

444
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,940
Come on, get in.

445
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,260
I wanna show you something. Yeah?

446
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,460
He's 6'7, 300
pounds and lethal.

447
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,060
Do not take this guy on.

448
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,180
And whatever you do, don't
ever get into his car.

449
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,340
What do you think?

450
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,860
It's beautiful.

451
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,900
Let me get you a drink.

452
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,900
You paint?

453
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,140
Yeah, it's more of a hobby, really.

454
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,420
Pretty serious hobby.

455
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,500
Cheers.

456
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,180
That's the sitting area,
the fireplace.

457
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,020
-Chillaxing room.
-Heh-heh.

458
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,660
This is the place I'm most
proud of, right here.

459
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,380
Who's this guy?

460
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,500
That is 14th century Buddha.

461
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,500
And that was a bitch to
get into this country.

462
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,500
It's nice to have friends,
you know, good friends

463
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,860
that make a difference.

464
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,620
You got food friends?

465
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,220
I mean, really good friends.

466
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,620
You're shaking like a leaf.

467
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,220
Sit down.

468
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,820
All right, all right.

469
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,700
Okay, let me do it.

470
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,140
Slow down, cowboy.

471
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,820
I told you to make it clean.

472
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,900
See you later.

473
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,340
Was it work or pleasure?

474
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,740
I wish someone would
hurt me like that.

475
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,020
Hey.

476
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,420
Thanks.

477
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,700
I'm gonna call him Arthur.

478
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,500
Yeah.

479
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,500
You used an outside individual
to complete your assignment.

480
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,420
That's a violation of
our arrangement.

481
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,140
My arrangement was with Harry.

482
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,900
You and I don't have one.

483
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,580
Just the price.

484
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,420
Or think someone trained by me
would be valuable to you.

485
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:26,020
Harry McKenna's son? Does he
know you killed his father?

486
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,980
This job needs to be
done immediately.

487
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,620
The client's willing to
pay a premium for it.

488
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,980
I don't think so. It's too quick.

489
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,660
Your behavior is making me and
the others extremely uneasy.

490
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,660
You're on a short leash
with this one.

491
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,540
The file is a priority.

492
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,940
I'll look it over.

493
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,620
I am one with God. God touches
me and I touch his people.

494
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,380
Andrew Vaughn, 45 years old, calls
himself The New Messiah.

495
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,940
So, Reverend Vaughn... 

496
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,380
Just Vaughn.

497
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,620
I'm not a reverend. I'm not endorsed
by any of the world religions.

498
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,780
I am above them. I am Vaughn.

499
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,620
He has made millions of dollars
through his churches

500
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,980
his ministries, 
his television programs.

501
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,700
Basically, he is running a cult.

502
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,300
Adrenalin shot to the heart,
12 cc's, and he's dead

503
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,460
in under three minutes.

504
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,740
Adrenalin's unreliable. One in
four survive cardiac arrest.

505
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,540
But when the EMTs arrive,

506
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,860
the first thing they do is jam you
with a shot of epinephrine.

507
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,140
- Which is toxic when combined with... 
- Adrenaline.

508
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,860
So in the off chance our
adrenaline shot doesn't kill him...

509
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,860
The EMTs will.

510
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,220
He left a Bible study group
with a young devotee one night.

511
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,660
They didn't find her body
until two weeks later.

512
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,500
The autopsy said she had an
abortion and was telling

513
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,900
her friends it was his.

514
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,940
Cost him $22 million to hush it up.

515
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,620
Okay, let's get this over with.

516
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,620
Bless you. Next.

517
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,740
Why don't you come sit right here?

518
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,940
You're new here.

519
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,820
- How long you been here?
- Two weeks.

520
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,420
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

521
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,420
Eighteen.

522
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,100
You could have found us someone
more attractive to spy on.

523
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,460
He's still eating.

524
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,460
Soup, salad, sandwich.

525
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,100
Double chocolate cake.

526
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,220
Bishop, I'm hungry.

527
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,780
The guy at the deli, he had Band-Aids
on all of his fingers.

528
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,620
If you find a Band-Aid in your
sandwich, it wasn't mine.

529
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,260
We're all clear.

530
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,380
-How do you feel, Vaughn?
-How do you think I feel?

531
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,060
-Where's Frank?
-I sent for him.

532
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,620
He should be here any minute.

533
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,300
Speak of the devil.

534
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,980
Give me something special today.

535
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,180
I feel like celebrating.

536
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,420
I have the spirit's work to do.

537
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,140
The spirits are gonna
work in your favor.

538
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,340
Hmm.

539
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,700
The guy's a junkie.

540
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,540
He's giving him ketamine.

541
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,900
-So?
- Ketamine counteracts adrenaline.

542
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,340
This won't work now.

543
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:12,140
I have been tapped on
the shoulder by God.

544
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,180
What do you wanna do?

545
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,580
I did not ask for this,

546
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,820
but my shoulder was touched
by the sword of the king.

547
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:28,700
And he told me to rise up.

548
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,500
We've gotta pack it up.

549
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,020
-Wait, wait. 
-If he comes back in here...

550
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,460
We'll be gone soon.

551
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,740
Yes, hello.

552
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,140
Yes, yes, it is.

553
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,540
In the king's name.

554
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,380
-Hey.
-Get the scope.

555
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,340
Put it down his throat.

556
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,900
Down his throat.

557
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,740
This will choke him.

558
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,300
If they think that I'm going
to pay full price

559
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,900
for a four-bedroom in this
market, they're crazy.

560
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:05,540
Only I can tie others.

561
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,420
How can I change the world?

562
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,860
How can I be a better man
for my parishioners,

563
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,460
-for my flock?
- Let's go.

564
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,660
Sometimes I wonder.

565
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,740
Sometimes I wonder

566
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,060
if I have the strength,
the courage.

567
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:32,500
I look at myself in the
mirror and think...

568
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,020
- And then I...
- Christ.

569
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,820
- Ralph, get in here.
- What is it?

570
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,380
What is it?

571
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,740
-Is he dead?
-Yes, he's dead.

572
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,860
Stupid motherfucker. I knew
this was gonna happen.

573
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,500
Get all this shit rounded up

574
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,980
and get it the fuck out of
here as fast as you can.

575
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,860
Try and pick him up.

576
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,140
Fuck.

577
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,060
Go check it out.

578
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,660
Take it off the wall.

579
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,220
Follow them.

580
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,500
Cover the exits and get me
two guys on the roof now.

581
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,220
There he is.

582
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,220
Oh!

583
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,900
Go that way.

584
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:17,260
Stay calm and exit
through the main door.

585
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,020
They're looking for two men. Get a
connecting flight out of Midway,

586
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:23,820
I'll fly out of O'Hare, I'll
meet you at the house.

587
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,740
Right this way. Let's go.

588
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,700
This way, folks.

589
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,420
Yeah. Yeah, right.

590
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,540
Andrew Vaughn, the
controversial and polarizing

591
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:37,420
religious figure,

592
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,780
has been pronounced dead.

593
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:43,260
Police are investigating the shooting
that occurred shortly thereafter.

594
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,340
The perpetrators have
not been found.

595
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,980
Attention all passengers,

596
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,940
please keep all of your belongings
with you at all times.

597
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,300
Do not leave bags unattended.

598
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,180
All five were killed.

599
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,180
All five were killed.

600
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,460
You probably knew some of
the men on that team.

601
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,100
Taxi.

602
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,300
Terminal D?

603
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,140
Next bus. Down the street.

604
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,420
Leaves in 15 minutes. Thanks.

605
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:04,180
When does this leave?
In 15 minutes.

606
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,460
Doesn't give us much time, then.

607
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,260
What do you want?

608
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,980
I wanna know what you're
doing alive.

609
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,820
Last time I saw you, you had
a bullet in your head.

610
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,180
What really happened in Cape Town?

611
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,860
Where's the rest of your
team? They're dead.

612
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,020
Who paid you? Was it Harry or Dean?

613
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:39,900
Dean paid me a very large amount
of money to kill the others.

614
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,540
Told me to fake my
death. Disappear.

615
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,860
You know what else he told me?

616
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:48,060
That Harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operation.

617
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:53,220
He was about to blow the whistle
and had to be taken care of.

618
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,900
They knew just the man for the job.

619
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,660
Someone who could get to him.

620
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,780
It's not the fact that
you killed him, is it?

621
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,140
It's that they played you so easily.

622
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,940
That's what bothers you.

623
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,100
Am I right?

624
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,300
Well? Not so good for your side.

625
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:56,180
Those were my two best teams. I
guess I'll have to send more.

626
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,380
Save the fuel.

627
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,860
I'm coming for you.

628
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,020
When are you gonna be home?

629
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,340
I'm really hungry.

630
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,100
Where are you?

631
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,180
I'm in the living room.

632
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,980
Sit down on the couch. Okay.

633
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,100
I'm guessing you're not alone.

634
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,460
There's a gun down the
left side cushion.

635
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,780
It's loaded and the safety's off.

636
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,060
But I'm not a lefty.

637
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,540
Then you're gonna die.

638
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,860
All right. I'll see you
when you get here.

639
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,380
I'll be there in five.

640
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,860
Who sent those guys?
The man who employs me.

641
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,300
Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

642
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,140
You set?

643
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,100
Get in the boat.

644
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:28,340
You ever think about the
people you've killed?

645
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,500
No.

646
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,660
You ever kill someone you know?

647
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,620
Yes.

648
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:49,180
Did it feel any different?

649
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,740
Not in the moment.

650
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,340
After.

651
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:06,780
Do you give them some kind of
warning or time to prepare?

652
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:09,700
Kind of time to

653
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:14,180
make peace?

654
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,060
There's no peace.

655
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:28,220
So it's best not to let them
know when you're coming.

656
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,980
Yes.

657
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,300
I guess it doesn't really
matter anyway,

658
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,260
as long as they're dead
and you're not, right?

659
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:06,980
Hello, Finch.

660
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,620
Oh, my God, who are you?

661
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:23,340
What are you doing here?
Oh, God. Jesus.

662
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,220
I want you to listen to me closely.

663
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,780
I don't care who I hurt or who I kill.

664
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,620
Understand?

665
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,700
No, please. No.

666
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,300
No, no, no.

667
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,260
You're gonna tell me exactly what
I came here to find out.

668
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,860
Where's Dean?

669
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,580
It's up to you how far I go.

670
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,260
Fingers.

671
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,620
Wrist.

672
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,940
Elbow.

673
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,500
Jesus, John, tell him what
he wants to know.

674
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,180
Okay, okay.

675
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,340
300 Colby Plaza.

676
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,100
300 Colby Plaza. That's
where he is, I swear.

677
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,460
Looks like you're gonna
miss a good dinner.

678
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,780
My God, you're a bastard.

679
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:05,540
Yes.

680
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,820
How much
was Harry's life worth?

681
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,180
Fifty million.

682
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,860
And here's what I'm gonna do.

683
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:20,180
Ten million wired to the bank of
your choice within 24 hours.

684
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,100
It's a good deal. You should take it.

685
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,220
Not interested.

686
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,540
The killer grows a conscience.

687
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,260
I'd say that's a breach of professional
ethics, Mr. Bishop.

688
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:36,260
Harry's death was business,
pure and simple.

689
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,300
Well, it's not gonna
be so simple now.

690
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:41,300
You got that right.

691
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:44,940
Because now I'm gonna put a price
on your head that's so big,

692
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,700
when you look in the mirror,

693
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,380
your reflection's gonna wanna
shoot you in the face.

694
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:53,540
You won't survive that
long. You're a fool.

695
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,460
You think you can get to
me before I get to you?

696
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,460
I already have.

697
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:04,860
Where's Conference Room E?

698
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,180
Floor upstairs, sir.

699
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:09,060
He's in the building. Get
me the fuck out of here.

700
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,820
Did they find Bishop? Nothing yet.

701
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,460
No, no, no. Get
off the fucking bus.

702
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,660
Move. Get off the fucking
bus. Move.

703
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,460
Go!

704
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,940
Whoa!

705
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,020
Back up, come on. Let's go.

706
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,940
Fuck you.

707
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:48,020
What's the plan now?

708
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,820
Disappear.

709
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,620
New names. New occupation.

710
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,260
Together?

711
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,660
That's up to you.

712
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,060
What are we gonna do?
We gonna whittle?

713
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:05,540
We gonna get bunk beds?
Move into a teepee?

714
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,420
Want a water?

715
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:27,260
I've always had this

716
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:32,300
anger inside,

717
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,860
and now I feel like I have
a place to put it.

718
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:39,340
I think I would miss this
if I had to stop now.

719
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:48,220
I could always go into
business for myself.

720
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,780
There are a lot of people
out there who would pay.

721
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,180
And I think you were wrong.

722
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:00,300
Vengeance is the mission.

723

Last chance.

I'm sorry for everything
that happened.
