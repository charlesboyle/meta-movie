- Listen to me, everyone!

This stranger saved our lives.
He carried the rifleman
all the way back here.

Ow! Hey, watch the arm.

- Sir.

Hold it right there.

338
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,562
I'm very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us, stranger,

339
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,835
but something
doesn't smell right.

340
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:30,640
You got back almost as fast as we did
and through the forbidden forest.

341
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:33,477
On top of that, you did it
with two badly injured men,

342
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:36,484
- and you want me
to believe that you--
- Kohroku! Kohroku!

343
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:39,248
- You're alive!
- <i>Toki, my love!</i>

- [Gasps]
- Huh?

345
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:46,421
That's just great!
How are you gonna drive the ox
now all banged up and mangled?

346
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:48,554
- <i>But, my little flower</i>--
- You scared me half to death.

347

Don't you "little flower" me.
I wish the wolves <i>had</i> eaten you.

Sweetness, can we
discuss this later?

350
00:31:56,272 --> 00:32:00,174
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

351
00:32:00,242 --> 00:32:02,777
And as for you, Gonza, a fine
captain of the guard you are,

352
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:03,709
And as for you, Gonza, a fine
captain of the guard you are,

throwing your weight around
once the danger's over.

354
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:08,715
You never do a lick
of work around here.

355
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:10,717
That's unfair and untrue.

356

My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

357
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:19,385
That's a relief. I was starting
to think I'd done something
wrong by bringing him back home.

359

to thank him personally.

- Uh, yes?

-Uh, okay.

Uh-oh, milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

366
00:32:42,216 --> 00:32:44,150
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

367
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:49,155
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.
I was responsible.
I should never have let it happen.

368
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:51,953
Oh, that's all right. Milady,
if you hadn't been there,

369
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:56,156
the wolves would have eaten
everyone, and then we'd all have
to find ourselves new husbands.

370

Get some rest, traveler.
I will see you this evening.

Toki was right.
He is handsome.

you're all eating tonight,

- You would?
- We'll have to work in makeup tonight.

It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

398
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,393
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

399
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:38,761
They say that happy women

Women like that-- It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

402

Lady Eboshi goes around
buying the contract of
every brothel girl she can find.

00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,610
Milady has a kind heart,
that's all.

404
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,648
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

405
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:58,173
It's true. Everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.

406
00:34:58,252 --> 00:35:01,415
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

407
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:04,685
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

408
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:07,522
- Who's Nago?
- "Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.

409
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:09,528
He used to rule
this whole forest.

410
00:35:09,596 --> 00:35:12,463
We couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.

411
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,899
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months,

412
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:16,903
starin' at a bunch
of angry boars.

413
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:19,804
Mm-hmm. See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

414
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:25,106
Then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain, but Nago
wasn't gonna stand for that.

415
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:29,081
The problem was, before
we could dig for the iron,
we had to clear away the forest,

416
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:31,083
and that's what
made the boar angry.

No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

rotted his flesh and
turned him into a monster.

Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

1474
02:07:41,461 --> 02:07:43,929
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1475
02:07:43,997 --> 02:07:47,865
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.

1476
02:07:47,935 --> 02:07:52,167
I'll always be near.
Yakul and I will come and visit you...

1477
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:54,605
<i>whenever we can, all right?</i>

1478
02:08:04,918 --> 02:08:09,855
Amazing. The wolves and
that crazy little Wolf Girl
helped save us all.

1479
02:08:09,923 --> 02:08:13,950
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1480
02:08:14,027 --> 02:08:18,327
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

1481
02:08:18,398 --> 02:08:22,596
Well, I give up!
You can't win against fools!!
