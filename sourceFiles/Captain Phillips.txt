1
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,049
They're here!

2
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,823
Hurry, Muse!

3
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,940
What the hell are you doing?
Why aren't you out on the water?

4
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,946
You know what you're supposed to do!

5
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,115
You should be out there
earning money!

6
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,814
But we caught a ship last week.

7
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,960
That was last week!

8
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,521
The boss wants money today!

9
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,222
Bring Garaad another ship soon...

10
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,128
...or you will answer for it!

11
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,634
Everybody, get back to work now!

12
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,872
Stay out of my way today.

13
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,743
<i>Hey!</i>

14
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,016
I'm going to get us something big!

15
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,057
Those who want to make money,
come.

16
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,430
Muse, take me with you.

17
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,497
Does your sister know you're here?

18
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,932
She's selling khat up there.

19
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,004
This is her best stuff.

20
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,016
When we get a big ship,
you will be well paid.

21
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,881
You want to work?

22
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,180
Do you know how to steer a boat?

23
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,550
Go, go.

24
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,225
I'm ready.

25
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,054
- What do you have for me?
- Money..

26
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,459
- When are you gonna give it to me?
- As soon as we're paid.

27
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,097
Spread out!

28
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,736
Let my other man choose his crew.

29
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,701
Next time bring me something
if you want to work.

30
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,719
Come on, Bilal.

31
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,326
Hey, Skinny, I can steer your boat.

32
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,623
If you choose me, you won't regret it.

33
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,929
Okay, Elmi.

34
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,002
I need somebody strong.

35
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,142
Somebody like this?

36
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,288
I want him.

37
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,121
Get out of my way!

38
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,029
Why did he pick him?

39
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,462
He's from another village.

40
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,908
Move!

41
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,056
Faster, move faster!

42
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,057
See if you can get more power.

43
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,232
<i>Okay.</i>

44
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,928
You!

45
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,606
Get over here!

46
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,572
Come help us!

47
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,987
Their main route is packed
with ships...

48
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,156
...but we can't attack a herd.

49
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,731
This one is alone.

50
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,706
She's really big! Get ready!

51
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,213
You worry about yourself, skinny rat!

52
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:04,054
Brothers,
we're going to make a lot of money!

53
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,195
Slow down! The waves are too big!

54
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,314
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

55
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,318
We've got to get out of here!

56
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,948
Turn back, turn back!

57
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,524
What are you doing?

58
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,464
Where are you going?

59
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,828
Come on! Keep going!

60
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,100
Faster, faster!

61
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,587
Hurry, hurry! Go!

62
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,359
We're pushing this engine too hard!

63
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,267
Faster, faster!

64
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,361
Come on, let's go!

65
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,108
This thing is busted.

66
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,677
- Then fix it!
- I'm trying!

67
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:20,490
The ocean was rough. Really rough.

68
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,623
Hufan, I'm telling you,
our boat couldn't take it.

69
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,497
Nothing was working for us.

70
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,834
Hurry up.

71
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,669
We need a bigger one for that ship.

72
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,540
I want this welded by the morning...

73
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,112
...by tomorrow, got it?

74
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,184
Elmi.

75
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,412
When will that engine be ready?

76
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,684
We've gotta fix it.

77
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,520
This thing is old and weak.

78
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,252
It's a piece of shit.

79
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:58,334
Shut up and fix it
for your crew of women.

80
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,430
Why don't you give me your engine?

81
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:10,271
Shut up, Skinny. You talk too much.

82
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,745
I may be skinny, but I'm not a coward.

83
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,452
What did you say?

84
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,791
Say it again!

85
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,097
You think you're somebody?

86
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,868
Say it again!

87
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:55,751
The coward is the first one in the grave.

88
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,830
Get ready!

89
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,339
They're not stopping.

90
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,017
Show them who we are, Muse.

91
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,919
Shoot at them!

92
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,268
Turn!

93
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,738
It's clear over there!

94
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,631
Untie the ladder.

95
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,361
Shoot him!

96
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,529
Let's go, let's go!

97
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,668
Hurry up, Bilal.

98
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,867
Move your ass, kid.

99
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,861
Stop him!

100
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,593
Higher. Get it higher.

101
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,044
Hook it on!

102
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:46,826
Get out of my way.

103
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:46,237
Get away. Get over there.

104
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,790
From now on
this one is called Irish, okay?

105
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,982
Hey, calm down! Calm down.

106
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,022
Watch this ugly one.

107
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,398
What are you doing?

108
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,764
I'm going to fix it.

109
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,930
Do you know how?

110
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,665
Hold the gun on him.

111
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,434
I've got him, don't worry.

112
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:35,080
Don't mess with anything
you don't know.

113
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,276
Come on, man.

114
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:43,815
- What are you doing?
- Just take care of that guy.

115
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,425
Stop the games.

116
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:33,308
Get that one
and put him against the wall.

117
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,175
Wait.

118
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,218
Take his radio.

119
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,435
Take his ﬂashlight.

120
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,607
Check this room.

121
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,019
I heard something!

122
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:02,639
Check the other side.

123
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,184
There's no one here.

124
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,515
Please, let's go back.

125
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,620
Look, man, get us out of here.

126
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,236
Hey, take him upstairs.

127
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,143
I can't move.

128
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,783
Take him upstairs
and tell Najee to come.

129
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:50,875
If one of them moves,
send them to their graves.

130
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,284
Here.

131
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,456
What happened to you?

132
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:41,824
They put glass down for me.
They got me.

133
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,521
Where is Muse?

134
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,926
In the engine room.

135
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,959
He wants Najee to come down.

136
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:29,644
Hey! Get me out of here!

137
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,678
<i>Listen to what these guys have to say.</i>

138
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,842
What happened?

139
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,314
<i>They cut my hand bad.</i>

140
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,182
We'll straighten everything out later.
Just get me out of here.

141
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,551
<i>Give Irish the radio.</i>

142
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,552
I'll give it to him now.

143
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,632
Thirty thousand is nothing.

144
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,102
I want millions!

145
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:09,605
Hey, Bilal, check it out.

146
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,578
If anyone moves, kill them.

147
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:15,773
Kill them!

148
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,581
What's going on, Skinny?

149
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,020
Do what they say
and get me out of here.

150
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,522
Be strong, man.

151
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,568
Show him.

152
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,216
Bilal, hold the gun on him.

153
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:50,729
Go!

154
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,724
Go.

155
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:25,295
Irish, it's only us now.

156
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:21,483
Hufan, do you read me?

157
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,925
Hufan, can you hear me?

158
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,620
Where's your boss?
He should be with us by now.

159
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,627
Don't worry. He's coming.

160
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,670
Stupid hand.

161
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,105
Stop whining.
You sound like a little girl.

162
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:52,650
You wanted to come with us.
You asked for this.

163
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,311
I didn't think this would happen.

164
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,752
I could lose my foot.

165
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:00,985
You have to be ready for anything.

166
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,756
This game isn't for the weak.

167
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,380
What is it?

168
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,946
It's a gift.

169
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,905
Give me some khat.

170
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,416
Why?
You've had more than your share.

171
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:07,645
Says who? Give me some more!

172
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,118
Shut up!

173
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,383
Both of you, shut up.

174
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,083
Just take it.

175
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,425
This is it?

176
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,630
That's all I have.

177
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:23,031
- Where is the rest?
- I don't have any.

178
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,229
It's all gone.

179
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:28,034
You are useless.
I should have taken it from you.

180
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,350
They'll fix him when we get back.

181
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:24,273
He's got a knife!

182
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,325
Go back. Get back there.

183
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,646
Drive this thing right!

184
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,654
Calm down. We're on the ocean.

185
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:54,191
I should throw you off this boat
right now!

186
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,022
You need to sit down and relax.

187
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,138
That's enough.

188
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,871
Take it away.

189
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,380
From now on this water is only for us.

190
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:27,216
Stop being such an asshole.

191
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,858
You've got to control him.

192
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,556
Just drive and shut up.

193
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:40,102
Hufan, can you hear me?

194
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:18,943
What's wrong with you?

195
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,546
Don't talk to me.

196
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:46,028
Hufan, can you hear me?

197
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,670
Hufan, can you hear me?

198
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:10,256
We should be heading northwest.

199
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,457
We've got to head for the port.

200
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,102
I am, but there's a lot of wind.

201
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,431
- Just go!
- Okay, then let me do it.

202
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,834
<i>Muse? Are you there?</i>

203
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,843
<i>Are you there?</i>

204
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,608
Hufan, where are you?

205
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:32,581
<i>I'm having trouble with the engine.</i>

206
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:36,682
<i>Head home.
I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

207
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:38,620
Hey, we're alone out here.

208
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,726
We need you to pick us up.

209
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,987
We've got to get out of this lifeboat.

210
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,688
<i>Shut up and listen to me.</i>

211
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,027
<i>You screwed up getting the ship...</i>

212
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,670
<i>...so Garaad says
bring back that captain...</i>

213
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,705
<i>...or don't come back at all.</i>

214
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:21,289
I need air.

215
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:25,725
When are we going to be home?

216
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:28,595
I can't feel my foot anymore.

217
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,203
It's like hell in here.

218
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:14,800
You think you have any power here?

219
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,571
- Let him go.
- I should shoot you and be done.

220
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,735
Take your gun off him.

221
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:23,712
I'm the captain.
Who do you think you are?

222
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:27,012
You're taking his side?

223
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:30,951
You let the American
do whatever he wants!

224
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,864
I'm losing control!

225
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:25,773
It's the Americans.

226
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,175
Get something to tie the doors.

227
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:56,503
<i>Calm down, brother.</i>

228
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:59,668
<i>We're here for the captain, not for you.</i>

229
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:02,012
They have a spy with them.

230
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,045
Hey, you. Who are you?

231
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,313
My name is Nemo.

232
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,147
I work with the U.S. Navy.

233
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,787
<i>We just want to talk.</i>

234
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,133
It's not that easy...

235
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,000
...but we'll work on it.

236
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:28,799
<i>In the meantime,
what if I bring you some food and water?</i>

237
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,723
They're coming.

238
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:59,093
Bill, watch him.

239
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:00,289
Watch him closely.

240
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:54,978
Open your door!
We are here with your supplies.

241
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:08,163
Calm down, brother.
We're just here to help you.

242
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:19,603
Listen, we need to see our guy.

243
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,715
We've got supplies,
food, water for you...

244
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:24,747
<i>...need to see our Captain.</i>

245
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:31,486
- They want to see him.
- Bring him out.

246
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:13,422
Get him back inside.

247
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,090
Shut up and don't move.

248
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,600
Calm down, we just want to talk.

249
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:20,365
We've got your supplies here.
Food, water.

250
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,750
Listen, you're hurt.

251
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:37,981
We've got doctors on board.

252
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:40,682
- Let us take care of you.
- Hurry up!

253
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:43,421
They're treating us like children.

254
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:46,629
It's not that easy...

255
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:48,768
...so we need time.

256
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:50,925
We've got to talk about this.

257
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,833
Hurry up, I said!

258
01:29:13,581 --> 01:29:15,788
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

259
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,863
- You'll get us all killed!
- Do you have to talk all day?

260
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,967
You're crazy.
What do you think you're doing?

261
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:23,534
All you do is talk!

262
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:26,294
Move.

263
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,805
You have to be strong
to get what you want.

264
01:31:57,912 --> 01:31:59,755
Hey, this situation has gone bad.

265
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:02,690
There are two more ships,
one on either side.

266
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:05,592
That one is huge.

267
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:23,176
Bilal, get the ropes.

268
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:28,115
The other ropes.

269
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:28,366
He got out!

270
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:31,162
Turn the boat around!

271
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:32,963
Bilal, you idiot!

272
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:49,879
Turn it! Faster, faster!

273
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,519
Move, or we'll leave you!

274
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:21,175
Find him. Don't kill him.

275
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:39,469
Don't shoot!

276
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:45,273
Stop! What are you doing?

277
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:48,208
He's getting away!

278
01:36:51,105 --> 01:36:54,609
- Don't kill him!
- Better to kill him than let him escape!

279
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,755
There he is!

280
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,458
I'm ordering you. Don't kill him.

281
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:26,349
Where is he?

282
01:37:32,446 --> 01:37:34,448
Here he is! Here he is!

283
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:47,738
He's here!

284
01:38:56,497 --> 01:38:58,067
Are you crazy?

285
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:15,522
Stop him!

286
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,726
That's enough!

287
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:28,970
Don't kill him!

288
01:39:31,332 --> 01:39:33,334
If you kill him, we'll all die!

289
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:38,876
- What do you want me to do with him?
- What is he doing?

290
01:39:53,354 --> 01:39:55,163
It's a helicopter!

291
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:57,495
Get to the other side!

292
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:05,733
Hurry! Go!

293
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:06,969
I'm trying.

294
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:12,810
Go!

295
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:22,518
They think you're playing games.

296
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:24,788
Do something!

297
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:40,843
Do you want to go
to an American prison?

298
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:44,816
Is that what you want?

299
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,416
I know how to handle America.

300
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:49,452
Give me the pistol.

301
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:52,990
They think I'm playing games, huh?

302
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:54,052
They have no respect for us!
They try to play games!

303
01:41:58,245 --> 01:42:00,748
Give me the radio.

304
01:42:01,849 --> 01:42:06,127
The helicopter is coming back.

305
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:32,178
They know us.

306
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,458
It's a lie.

307
01:43:58,832 --> 01:44:00,243
It's an ambush.

308
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:19,528
It's an ambush.

309
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,774
You need to be strong.

310
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,113
Don't let anyone in.

311
01:45:56,817 --> 01:45:58,990
Whatever happens, don't stop.

312
01:45:59,152 --> 01:46:00,722
It's my job.

313
01:51:44,998 --> 01:51:46,568
What's going on?

314
01:51:47,267 --> 01:51:49,338
I can't see.

315
01:51:49,936 --> 01:51:52,075
Give me the radio.

316
01:52:52,499 --> 01:52:55,776
Keep it steady. Keep it steady.

317
01:53:17,023 --> 01:53:19,663
If he moves again, shoot him.

318
01:53:41,214 --> 01:53:43,455
It's getting rough.

319
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:45,929
<i>Keep it straight.</i>

320
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:36,137
What kind of games are they playing?

321
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:39,450
I can't hold it straight.

322
01:54:42,809 --> 01:54:45,050
Be a man. Just shut up and steer.

323
01:57:19,932 --> 01:57:21,707
Stop him.

324
01:57:22,635 --> 01:57:23,909
Bilal, stop him.

325
01:57:31,844 --> 01:57:34,017
Bring the rope!

326
01:57:49,162 --> 01:57:50,664
Tie him!

327
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:12,859
What are you doing?

328
01:58:49,055 --> 01:58:50,728
Shut up!

329
01:58:51,591 --> 01:58:54,231
Get a blindfold!

330
01:59:11,377 --> 01:59:13,414
Blindfold him.

331
02:00:05,598 --> 02:00:07,635
Don't kill him!

332
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,837
The elders are coming.

333
02:00:10,002 --> 02:00:11,379
We will get our money.

334
02:00:11,571 --> 02:00:13,983
You are both idiots.

335
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:15,710
No one is coming.

336
02:00:33,826 --> 02:00:37,103
That's it. We will all die if you kill him.

337
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,904
Everything they told you was a lie!

338
02:00:40,099 --> 02:00:41,806
They will kill us all...

339
02:00:41,968 --> 02:00:44,107
...and he is behind everything!
