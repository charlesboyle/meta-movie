00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:45,913
Well, bear in mind that Mr. Hailey
is as guilty as sin under our legal system.

344
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:51,919
It does not permit vigilante violence,
and he took the law into his own hands.

345
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,589
He murdered two people.

346
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:59,635
Two people who had raped
his 10-year-old daughter.

347
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,139
You know...

348
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,558
...you can win this case...

349
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,894
...and justice will prevail.

But lose...

Now, that's a strange case.

enter another courtroom ever.

I've ever seen.

when they took your license away...

358
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,341

unless you let them.

out of law school?

00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,395
Yeah.

364
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,982
Now, you sat me down and you said to me,
"Young man, I cannot promise you riches.

is a chance to save the world...

back to you right now.

in green pastures.

371
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,509
He leadeth me beside still waters.

00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,346

of the shadow of death...

00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:29,851
...I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

a copy of an indictment returned...

446
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,742
...by the grand jury of Mississippi
presenting that:

447
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:19,622
"Carl Lee Hailey did murder Billy Ray Cobb,
a human being...

...and James Lewis Willard,
a human being...

...how my family might starve if they
didn't donate all they could, didn't you?

Well, the money is for you

-[WHISPERS] Buddy, have you seen Roark?
-Not yet.

1681
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:05,898
JAKE:
Doctor, would you explain to the jury...

1682
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:09,860
...the effect his daughter's rape
had on Mr. Hailey's condition?

1683
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:12,405
Tonya's rape caused a relapse...

1684
01:55:12,573 --> 01:55:14,740
...a temporary break with reality.

1685
01:55:15,409 --> 01:55:18,452
JAKE:
But yesterday, a Dr. Rodeheaver...

1686
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:21,664
...suggested that Mr. Hailey's
act of calculation was...

1687
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,583
...the very definition of sanity.

1688
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,835
That's ridiculous.

1689
01:55:26,003 --> 01:55:29,839
Many of the most famous
schizophrenics are calculating.

1690
01:55:30,007 --> 01:55:31,841
John Hinckley, for example.

1691
01:55:32,009 --> 01:55:33,050
Calculating.

1692
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:34,719
And legally insane.

1693
01:55:35,053 --> 01:55:37,888
All right, so, Dr. Bass,
how would you diagnose Mr. Hailey...

1694
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:39,390
...at the time of the murder?

1695
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:43,853
Mr. Hailey experienced a recurrence
of a dissociative condition...

1696
01:55:44,021 --> 01:55:47,898
...as a result of the trauma
caused by the rape of his daughter.

1697
01:55:48,317 --> 01:55:51,861
Now, since Mr. Hailey was unaware
of the reality of his actions...

1698
01:55:52,029 --> 01:55:54,405
...he could not tell right from wrong.

1699
01:55:54,573 --> 01:55:57,908
Nor could he understand
the consequences of his actions.

1700
01:55:58,076 --> 01:56:01,287
He was, therefore, legally insane.

1701
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:04,457
Could not tell right from wrong...

1702
01:56:04,625 --> 01:56:07,501
...nor understand the consequences
of his actions.

1703
01:56:08,045 --> 01:56:11,005
Therefore, legally, insane.

1704
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:15,551
Thank you, Dr. Bass.
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

1706

Thank you, Your Honor.

01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:31,150
-Good morning.
BASS: Good morning.

1710
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:36,072
Dr. Bass, could you please
state for the record your full name?

1711
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,574
Willard Tyrell Bass.

1712
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:41,952
Tyrell Bass. That's a very unique name.

1713
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:47,500
Now, doctor,
have you ever been convicted of a felony?

1714
01:56:47,668 --> 01:56:48,959
No, of course not.

1715
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:51,295
-You're certain?
-Yes.

testimony you've just given before this jury?

BASS:
Of course.

1718
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,845
So let me understand this now...

1719
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:02,390
...since you are under oath.

1720
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:07,478
You're telling me, and this jury,
that on October 17th, 1960...

1721
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:09,980
...you were not
convicted of statutory rape?

1722

Dr. Bass is not on trial here.

of the credibility of the witness.

-Overruled. Continue, Mr. Buckley.
RUFUS: Thank you.

1727
01:57:24,788 --> 01:57:26,914
...were you convicted of statutory rape?

on September 11th, 1960.

I'm gonna ask you one last time...

...were you or were you not
convicted of statutory rape?

They tie a noose.

2020
02:18:28,550 --> 02:18:31,886
Imagine the noose coiling
tight around her neck...

2021
02:18:32,429 --> 02:18:35,056
...and a sudden blinding jerk.

2022
02:18:36,141 --> 02:18:39,018
She's pulled into the air
and her feet and legs go kicking....

...back to the earth.

...pitch her over the edge.

2032
02:19:13,012 --> 02:19:17,890
And she drops some 30 feet
down to the creek bottom below.

2033
02:19:25,399 --> 02:19:27,275
