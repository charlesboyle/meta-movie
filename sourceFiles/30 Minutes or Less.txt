1
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,573
Thirty-four minutes, four minutes late.
Pizza's free.

2
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,830
You live two towns away.
It's impossible to get here in 30.

3
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,163
Exactly. That's why we order
from your shitty pizza parlor.

4
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,499
Okay. You guys are pretty smart.

5
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,667
You figured out a way
to beat the system.

6
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,127
- There you go.
- Thank you.

7
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,676
- What, no tip?
- Sorry, I only got the big bills.

8
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,512
You guys kind of remind me of me
when I was your age.

9
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,019
Just trying to get drunk
any chance I get.

10
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,976
I bet you got the fridge
full of beer, right?

11
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,311
- Man, we don't have anything.
- Really?

12
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,897
- Could you get us some beer?
- Me?

13
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,946
Listen, I shouldn't do this
but if you give me the money...

14
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,109
that your mom gave you,
which you didn't give me...

15
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,402
I will run out and get you some beer.

16
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,663
- Let him do it. Let's get shit-faced.
- But I want a tip.

17
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,367
- Okay.
- Okay, we have ...

18
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,628
- That's 40.
- Oh, thanks, man.

19
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,881
- Wait, how many am I getting?
- Whatever that will get us.

20
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,838
Okay. I will see you soon.

21
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,597
- Wait, you boys like O'Doul's, right?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,765
- Fucking love that shit.
- Totally.

23
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,843
You rule.

24
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,301
Okay.

25
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,928
All right.

26
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,180
All good.

27
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,936
Cool. You really went for it.

28
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,688
- Okay. Well, I will...
- Okay.

29
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,072
Call me.

30
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,699
I will. Yes, okay.

31
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,986
- All right, take care.
- Bye.

32
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,320
- See you.
- Bye.

33
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,739
Thanks again.

34
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,782
You have a great personality.

35
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,245
Hey. What the hell?

36
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,287
- You've been watching the whole time?
- Yeah, the whole show.

37
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,672
Really classy move there at the end.
The kiss.

38
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,925
If a woman is kind to provide me
with fellatio services...

39
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,212
I'm not gonna dart out of there
like she's an untouchable.

40
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,472
And they say chivalry is dead.
Have a beer.

41
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,347
The alcohol should help wash the taste
of yourself out of your mouth.

42
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,353
Well, thank you, sir.

43
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,103
Hey, I rented some movies for us.
I got Lethal Weapon.

44
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,939
- I got Lethal Weapon 2.
- I think I'm gonna have to pass.

45
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,105
- I gotta be up early to teach a class.
- Come on, you're a sub.

46
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,649
Just call in sick,
like the real teacher did.

47
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,571
I got promoted to full time last month.
You bought me a laser pointer.

48
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,205
I'm just having trouble
accepting you as the man...

49
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,536
because you're you.

50
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,623
Filling kids' heads with bullshit
just so you can have your summers off.

51
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,171
I'm sorry I have a career...

52
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,208
and I don't have time
to squeeze movies into my schedule.

53
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,004
- Okay. "Call of Duty"?
- Fine.

54
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,589
But you will get smoked.

55
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,930
- Fruit motherfucking salad.
- Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

56
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,847
- That was sick, Dwayne.
- That was fucking awesome.

57
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,430
- This one's gonna blow even bigger.
- Oh, yeah.

58
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,645
If you weren't a skinny bitch,
you could be in the military.

59
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,277
I don't need to be.
I taught myself how to do this.

60
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,904
- I went online and looked all this up.
- I hear you.

61
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,566
I taught myself how to eat pussy
and cut my own hair.

62
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,736
I taught myself how to eat pussy hair.
Let's do it.

63
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,325
- I want this one. Here...
- Give me the crossbow.

64
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,707
You get the crossbow.
I'll take the detonator.

65
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,665
- Blow that shit up, dude.
- This one's mine.

66
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,748
Bin Laden. This time it's personal.

67
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,756
Fuck you.

68
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,765
Whoa, man. It's so real.

69
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,267
- Run, bitch.
- Oh, check this shit out.

70
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,396
- What are you doing, dude?
- I'm not afraid of Jason. Look at me.

71
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,099
- I'm fucking Jason.
- Oh, my God.

72
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,309
- Get him, dude.
- In his fucking mask hole.

73
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,274
- Hey, come here, bitch.
- Keep that fucking mask on, Jason.

74
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,031
- I'm fingering his asshole.
- I'm gonna wrap his balls.

75
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,817
- I'm gonna fucking raw-dog him.
- I got your butt-pussy.

76
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,453
It's so hard. Fuck you, Jason.
Fuck you so...

77
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,614
Who are you two fags fucking?

78
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,955
- Just Jason Voorhees.
- Afternoon, major.

79
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,460
It's been 20 years, Dwayne.

80
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,960
When are you finally going to get up
the courage to ask him out?

81
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,258
That's not funny.
We're business partners.

82
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,260
Oh, yeah?
What kind of business are you in?

83
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,713
Some entre...

84
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,927
- Entrepreneurials.
- Entre...

85
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,634
That's not a business.
You can't even pronounce it.

86
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,685
We're just trying to watch this movie.

87
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,518
There's about 45 minutes left
and 3D titties coming up.

88
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,353
You're coming in at the worst time.

89
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,813
Yeah? I bought that TV
so I can watch football.

90
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,488
Not so that you and your boyfriend
can jack off all over it.

91
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,151
Well, then maybe you should learn
how to share the common space better.

92
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,329
Common? The only thing common
in this house is you.

93
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,119
Come on, Travis.
This movie sucks, anyway.

94
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,625
You look good, major.

95
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,998
I paid for the damn cold cuts too.

96
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,626
Maybe if you had a job
or a fucking prospect...

97
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,959
or a clue
how to get any of the above...

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,048
I'd let you eat them.

99
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,922
You're a cold son of a bitch, Dad.

100
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,386
That's what it takes, boy.

101
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,890
In the corps, pussies like you
wore dresses to keep us entertained.

102
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,350
That's really fucking disturbing.

103
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,933
Goddamn it. Oh, shit.

104
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,441
Talking to me about fucking cold cuts.
That son of a bitch.

105
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,447
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
He bought another new truck?

106
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,360
That's some high-end decal work,
Dwayne.

107
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,450
- Fuck the major.
- Yeah, fuck him, dude.

108
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,645
- Sorry.
- Very funny, but you're late.

109
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,225
No, I'm 45 minutes late,
which is like 10 minutes early for me.

110
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,403
Where the hell were you?
Vito's is, like, two blocks away.

111
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,529
Yeah, I got held up
trying to pick out...

112
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,736
the perfect shirt-and-hat
combo for you.

113
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,650
- What do you think?
- I like it.

114
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,943
It's very minimum-wage.

115
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,489
Thanks. I can't wait to quit
and take this shit off.

116
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,576
Say what you want about your boss...

117
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,711
but the man knows
how to make a pizza.

118
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,622
I hate that guy. He can suck a dick.

119
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,665
Did you see Tom Small's
Facebook update?

120
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,006
No, you know I don't check that shit.
I'm off the grid.

121
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,846
- He came out.
- What?

122
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,679
He even posted a picture of him
and his Latin boyfriend.

123
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,888
Tom Small is gay?

124
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,554
That kid used to beat me and Chet
in grammar school.

125
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,599
Tell me about it.
He OTPF'd me at Junior High Formal.

126
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,234
- What the hell is that?
- "Over the pants fingered."

127
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,894
That's disgusting.

128
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,985
So I've got news.

129
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,941
Even bigger news
than that Tom Small?

130
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,109
I don't know if
I can take much more news.

131
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,871
This corporation called Four Seasons
decided to get their shit together...

132
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,829
and accept me into their
management training program.

133
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,959
Really?
Congratulations, that's amazing.

134
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,537
Thank you.

135
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,249
I can't believe they're opening in town.
We don't even have a Radisson.

136
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,168
Yeah, exactly,
which is why I'm moving to Atlanta.

137
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,050
I'm gonna be working
in their Special Events Department.

138
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,307
In Hotlanta?

139
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,430
I know a little about it
from rap music...

140
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,687
and it sounds
like a fucked-up place.

141
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,978
Come on. This is everything
I've been working toward.

142
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,688
- Did you tell your brother?
- Yeah. Chet was really happy for me.

143
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,158
- I thought you'd be happy for me too.
- I am. I'm totally happy for you.

144
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,160
In fact, I will make you a crunk CD
or something.

145
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,035
You can show off
to your new hustler friends in Atlanta.

146
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,123
He treats me like a bitch.
That's no way to treat a son.

147
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,083
He thinks he knows me. He doesn't.

148
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,214
I have more ideas
than he could dream of.

149
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,046
I have plans bigger than his house.

150
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,755
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.

151
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:31,924
Maybe just be quiet for a while,
forget about your old dad...

152
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,763
let me do my thing.

153
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,893
I wish I could forget
about that asshole.

154
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,101
As is, I'm pretty much just waiting
for him to drop dead.

155
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,437
I just don't want
to mess up my inheritance.

156
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,853
Really? What kind of inheritance?

157
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,155
Well, when the old man
left the service...

158
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,658
he started buying lotto tickets.
The next thing you know, in '98...

159
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,195
the dude hits it for $10 million.

160
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,991
And ever since then, he's been burning
through it like an NBA draft pick...

161
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,036
buying Winnebagos
and flat-screen TVs.

162
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,828
Just all this senseless spending.

163
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,748
He's probably down
to, like, 1 or 2 million now.

164
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,885
As soon as he kicks it,
all that cash is mine.

165
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:14,137
You know, with a million dollars...

166
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,268
you could have anything.

167
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,223
You could be like a king.

168
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,984
King Dwayne.

169
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,567
Right on.
And you could be like my queen.

170
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:32,326
- Polish my royal scepter.
- You know, practice makes perfect.

171
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,903
Oh, fuck you.

172
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,364
Maybe I could help you
get that money now.

173
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,577
Oh, yeah?

174
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,492
Before he spends another penny.

175
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,831
And how would you do that?

176
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,338
I know a guy in Detroit.

177
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:52,384
He could help you.
Probably do it for 100 G's.

178
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,719
Do what?

179
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,886
Kill your mean old dad.

180
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,393
So, what do you say?

181
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,647
Are you ready for your crown?

182
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,952
These are very bad for you.

183
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,245
Hey, watch out.

184
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,916
You should pace yourself there.
It's noon on a Saturday.

185
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,373
The fridge is full, man.
We're all good.

186
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,415
- Pretty crazy about Tom Small, huh?
- Yeah. Well, I never liked him.

187
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,677
Your sister did. You know,
she let him finger-blast her, bigtime.

188
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,180
What are you talking about?
I don't want that in my head.

189
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,013
Sorry. Your sister told me.
I thought you should know.

190
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,269
Swapping stories
about getting fingered?

191
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,022
No. It's just that your sister
makes some questionable decisions.

192
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,650
You know, like...
Like moving to Atlanta.

193
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,277
What's wrong?
She's gonna manage a hotel.

194
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,986
I get free rooms. Go there and crash
whenever you're out on the streets.

195
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,319
Except her once she gets involved
with some Atlanta douche bag...

196
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,032
that's totally wrong for her.

197
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,075
Some doctor who drives a white BMW
and listens to Phish. It's fucking lame.

198
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,287
Whatever. Why are we talking
about who my sister goes out with?

199
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,704
I don't know.

200
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,625
I was always kind of partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

201
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,592
- You want to fuck my sister, don't you?
- Chet, I don't want to talk about this.

202
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,223
My twin sister?
Which is basically like fucking me?

203
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,556
Oh, hardly. Your sister is attractive
and she excites me.

204
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,723
Yes, in a sexual way. Can we please
just be adults about this?

205
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:30,189
You, an adult? You had a Lunchables
for dinner last night.

206
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,477
You're a man-child.

207
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,780
Let's not say shit
we can't take back, okay?

208
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,236
How about this?
You wanna know who I saw naked?

209
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,403
- Who?
- Miss Jenny Rifkin.

210
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,831
When I was nailing her the week after
she dumped you, intercourse style.

211
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,878
That's right, my brown hands
all over her nice, white titties.

212
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,590
You pulled a Judas
on Jenny-fucking-Rifkin.

213
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,592
That is messed up, Chet.

214
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,888
Almost as messed up as how I sold
your Willie Mays signed ball...

215
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,264
for 200 bucks.

216
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,766
My grandpa left me that ball in his will.
You helped me look for it for a month.

217
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,430
Now you know why we never found it.
Are we done here?

218
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,270
- Not quite yet.
- Okay.

219
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,195
I told John Tanner about
how your mom fucked that lifeguard.

220
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,988
I felt awful about it,
even though he swore secrecy...

221
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,694
he wound up telling everyone.

222
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,157
Then your parents got divorced.
But now, I don't give a shit.

223
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,414
Well, then you ruined
my whole fucking life.

224
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,959
Not much of a life to ruin,
but yeah, I guess I did.

225
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,495
Okay, Chet.

226
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,712
You're right.
I do want to have sex with your sister.

227
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,093
Again. Because the first time
was so awesome.

228
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,800
- Bullshit. That never happened.
- Graduation night.

229
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,052
No. You fucked Tina Scotto.

230
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,719
No, I just told you I did.
Same story, different girl.

231
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,061
What? You deflowered my sister
and I know all the fucking details?

232
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,228
- Fuck.
- Yo, get the fuck off of me.

233
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,483
Stop hitting my knee.

234
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,490
You're twins.
Did you feel it when I was fucking her?

235
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,070
Motherfucker.

236
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,911
You fucking asshole.

237
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,245
Krav Maga.
Israeli self-defense technique.

238
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,628
Okay. I can't breathe.

239
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,129
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

240
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,133
Go to sleep.

241
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,262
- You're a huge loser.
- Fuck you.

242
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,469
You're not good enough
for my sister, okay?

243
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,508
You're a pizza boy.

244
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,437
You know, I actually feel sorry for you,
you fucking dick.

245
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,814
You'll never understand this.

246
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,642
It's more complicated
than your fucking online dating.

247
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,103
You're a shit friend.

248
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,688
All those years
of asking me for stuff, favors.

249
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,820
You know, that beat-down
is the last favor you'll ever get.

250
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,277
Good. It's the last one I'll ever need.

251
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,823
Yeah, I'll give you a call when I need
some fucking mozzarella sticks.

252
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,205
This pool is so dirty, dude.

253
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,670
Where do all these leaves
come from?

254
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,548
Where the hell do you think, dude?
From fucking trees.

255
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,968
That's what she said.

256
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,926
No, "that's what she said" jokes
don't work with that.

257
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,840
It has to be in a sexual reference.

258
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,552
Like, you know,
"These leaves are hard."

259
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,602
"That's what she said."

260
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,817
I hate this pool.

261
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,070
- Dwayne.
- What?

262
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,903
Look, I don't want to get in the middle
of a family matter or anything...

263
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,739
but killing the major seems
kind of messed up.

264
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:26,949
Right? Or no?

265
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,705
No, it's not messed up, dude.
It's barely even murder.

266
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:34,244
It's really just kind of shaving a few
years off an old man's shitty existence.

267
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,961
Hey, dipshit. If my pool ain't ready
in an hour, you don't get paid.

268
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,214
Maybe you ought to have woke
your lazy ass up before noon.

269
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,716
I woke up at 11:15, major.
That's a fact.

270
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,298
You look good.

271
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,636
Nice to see you too, Dad.
Love you so much.

272
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,060
Bye, major.

273
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,434
Fuck that dick.

274
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,063
You know why I sleep late, Travis?
It's not because I'm lazy.

275
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,737
It's on account of me having
so many goddamn dreams. Big ones.

276
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,157
Prepare yourself.

277
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,818
What is the one thing
that this town is missing?

278
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,076
I'll give you a hint.

279
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,786
It's a cash business
and it's crawling with sexy bitches.

280
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,082
- Chinese food restaurant?
- No.

281
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,963
- Abortion clinic?
- Yuck, no.

282
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,839
A tanning salon.

283
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,592
You know? Think of all the green,
all the brown flesh.

284
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,969
And it's the perfect front
for a prostitution ring.

285
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,306
- And guess what.
- What?

286
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,189
I'm willing to cut you in on it. Yep.
Make you a partner in business...

287
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:40,523
if, and only if,
you'll be my partner in crime.

288
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,728
You want to be
fucking rich and famous...

289
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,193
helping dudes
to come and get tans?

290
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,199
Or do you want to be
a fucking pussy...

291
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,237
and clean this asshole's pool
for 10 bucks an hour?

292
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,119
Yeah, all right, I'll do it.

293
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,626
But I'm not gonna shoot the major
or anything.

294
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,957
I'll hold him while you shoot him,
that's it.

295
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,542
No, I'm not shooting anybody.

296
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,084
If you want to be a millionaire,
you gotta start thinking like one.

297
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,546
Do you think millionaires murder
people? No. No, they don't.

298
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,215
They hire highly trained assassins
to do it for them.

299
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,428
Right.

300
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,934
- Which I have done.
- What?

301
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,764
Dwayne, where are we gonna get
$100,000 to pay this deadly assassin?

302
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,102
We're getting down
to the heart of the matter.

303
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,733
How do we get the 100 G's?

304
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,269
Once we have the 100 G's,
we have the million.

305
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,280
Once we have the million,
we own everything and everyone...

306
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,907
in this whole fucking town.

307
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,660
Yeah.
All right, maybe we rob a bank.

308
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,071
Isn't that what people do?

309
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,867
Go down to the local branch, shoot
some dipshit security guard and be like:

310
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,411
Not really thinking like a millionaire.

311
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,132
Then maybe we hire somebody
to rob a bank.

312
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,008
Dude, fuck hiring him.

313
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,797
Let's force some dumb motherfucker
to rob a bank for us.

314
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,088
What?

315
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,801
So I film myself
banging this dude's wife, okay?

316
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,312
I talk her into doing degrading shit.
Get the neighborhood kids over.

317
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,973
They all whack off on her face.

318
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,939
And then we use the tape to blackmail
her husband into robbing the bank.

319
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,443
That's a great idea, Dwayne.
Really good.

320
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,607
I just think it might be a little hard...

321
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:13,153
to find a wife that slutty and gross
by Tuesday.

322
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,739
Yeah, seduction does take time.
What do we do?

323
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,999
Do we use political pressure,
death threats?

324
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,201
Or a bomb.

325
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,663
Everyone's afraid of a bomb, Dwayne.

326
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:29,510
I was going to say hypnotism
but I like a bomb.

327
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,013
- Yeah. That's thinking outside the box.
- Right?

328
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,765
You'd just stick it to him
like we do the watermelons?

329
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,177
- Yeah, just strap it on, man.
- You can do that?

330
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,186
Yeah. Camel jockeys do it in caves.

331
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,349
I got a fucking dope-ass
garage workshop in America.

332
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,732
This is true. What I like about this,
is this how a millionaire would do it.

333
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,485
We don't have to lose any sleep.
Nobody gets hurt.

334
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,694
Except the major.

335
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,154
The trick is gonna be,
where do we get our dude?

336
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,786
Because if we're going to commit
to a kidnapping...

337
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,824
that's just as risky as a murder.
That's a good point.

338
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,787
We have to bring the dude to us...

339
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,703
lure him into a situation
we have total control over.

340
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,373
We also gotta make sure this dude
is not connected to us in any way.

341
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,258
We '// deliver anywhere...

342
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,296
in 30 minutes or less
or your pizza is free.

343
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:17,137
Vito 's Pizza, where the customer
gets what they want.

344
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,814
Sometimes fate
pulls out its big old cock...

345
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,316
and slaps you right in the face.

346
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,521
Yeah.

347
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,024
Pepperoni's up.

348
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:33,111
Give me the bag.
Not that bag, the other bag.

349
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,743
I don't mean to interrupt
your curing of cancer...

350
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,949
but it's time to get back
on the street.

351
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,452
I'm off in 10 minutes.
Where the hell is this?

352
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,205
Here, let me check
my fuck-you map. Yeah, it's in...

353
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,915
Thirty Minutes or Less Land or else
the pizza comes out of your paycheck.

354
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,965
Ticktock.

355
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,768
Hello?

356
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,811
Hey, over here, buddy. The city's got
us working till the ass end of the night.

357
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,023
Yeah. I hear that.

358
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,816
Hey, listen, I know I'm probably
like 10, 15 minutes late, but...

359
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,071
That's a great mask.
That's very funny.

360
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,907
So about the whole 30-minutes thing,
are we cool...?

361
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,541
Another one. The missing link.

362
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,873
That's nice.
I wish I could get stoned too.

363
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,212
- Which gorilla handles the cash...?
- Get him.

364
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:20,344
- Yo, dude. Just take the pizza, man.
- Stop. Escape is impossible.

365
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,514
Fuck. What the hell?

366
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,225
Rape. Rape.

367
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,191
Step one.

368
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,530
You thought we were gonna rape you.
What an idiot.

369
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,291
All right, let's see, here.

370
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,629
"Mr. Nick Davis of 110 North"
Whatever-the-Fuck Street.

371
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:57,502
Right now, you are wearing
a highly explosive bomb vest.

372
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,973
Calm down. I'm carrying a piece.

373
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,299
Hey, man. Take it easy.

374
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,891
- I built the bomb, so it's pretty stable.
- For a fucking bomb.

375
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,897
Don't do anything stupid
like trip over your shoelaces.

376
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,481
That vest is packed with C-4.
The C is for "chaos."

377
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:18,280
it's actually for "composite,"
but yeah, don't bump into shit:

378
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,449
- Hey.
- Sit down.

379
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,110
- Sit down.
- Show him your kicks.

380
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,404
Show him your kicks.
Yeah, check that shit.

381
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,698
You want to pop off? Look at this.

382
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,918
Fucking stay there. You'll get that
right across your goddamn face.

383
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,503
Settle.

384
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,462
So, what do you think, pizza boy?
Can we take the tape off?

385
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,505
- I'm trusting you now.
- Help.

386
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,136
Help. Help me.

387
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,260
- Someone help him.
- He's serious.

388
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,511
- Help me.
- Help.

389
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,303
Someone help him.
Where the fuck do you think you are?

390
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,939
You might as well be in outer space.
Nobody can fucking hear you scream.

391
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,316
They would hear you more
in space, actually.

392
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,978
No, that's the thing.
You can't hear anyone in space.

393
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,488
- It's from Aliens.
- Why are you doing this to me?

394
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,321
Why does anybody do something
fucked up to someone else?

395
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,735
For money, dude.

396
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,366
I will sell my car, man.
I'll get you 1000 bucks.

397
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,447
- For that Mustang?
- You mean, $100.

398
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,787
No, I'll get you 1000 bucks,
I swear to God.

399
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,794
We're gonna need 100 grand.

400
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,497
Where the fuck am I supposed to get
that much money?

401
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,884
I don't know. Maybe the Donner-Wells
National Bank on Charles Road.

402
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,670
- By the Olive Garden.
- How am I supposed to rob a bank?

403
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,009
It's not my problem, it's yours.
Get creative.

404
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,766
Maybe use the scary bomb
strapped to your chest.

405
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,599
Maybe the old-fashioned way:
Get a gun, band of outlaws.

406
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,147
It doesn't matter to me.
It's not rocket science.

407
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,932
Fine. Then do it yourself.

408
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,648
I would do it,
but I'm wearing the gorilla mask...

409
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,357
and you're wearing that bomb.

410
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,444
- Tell him about the bomb vest.
- You seem like a smart guy.

411
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,618
But in Case you were gonna panic
and try to be a hero, like:

412
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,245
"I'm gonna take this vest off.
Fuck these guys."

413
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,748
Don't do that, okay?
We booby-trapped it to shit.

414
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,750
Okay, there's also
a little remote detonator on the back...

415
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,879
that we can trigger at any time
by dialing a number.

416
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,548
We got your shit on speed dial.
We're watching you.

417
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,594
So do what you gotta do, but know
that if you go near a police station...

418
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,880
Fourth of July's
coming early this year.

419
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,510
No, no. No, don't do that.

420
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,847
It's 9 a.m. You got 10 hours.

421
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,765
As soon as you get the money,
call this number here.

422
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,020
You call it.

423
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,356
We'll give you explicit directions
on where to make the drop-off.

424
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,398
If you do good, we'll give you
a six-digit combination...

425
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,817
that will stop the timer
and open the lock.

426
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:30,906
But if you don't do good, allow me
to make a little demonstration for you.

427
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,451
Pay attention to the cuddly bear
there on the barrel.

428
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,995
Ring, ring. Look, the bear's calling.
What a coincidence.

429
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,171
Hello, Bear, how's it going? Yeah?

430
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,046
You're just hanging out,
getting fucked up? That's cool.

431
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,302
What do you mean,
you couldn't rob the bank?

432
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,213
It was too hard?

433
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,724
So you went back to your bear cave
and hid like a little crying bitch?

434
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,977
Well, that's a shame,
my stuffed buddy.

435
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,600
Because time is up.

436
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,231
I liked that bear.
I don't even fucking know you.

437
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,937
- Well, get to it, man.
- Okay.

438
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,858
- Show-and-tell's over.
- All right. And you're free.

439
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,903
Let's move.
Time is literally ticking right now.

440
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,409
Here are your keys to your great car.

441
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,289
- Go on, now. Get after her.
- Okay.

442
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,951
Wait, wait, wait, can we just
maybe talk about this?

443
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,710
Yeah, of course we can talk.

444
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,999
Come on, man, get fucking moving.

445
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,125
Be careful. You're wasting time.

446
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,927
Go. Fucking move.

447
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,471
We'll be watching you.

448
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,054
Adios, you dumb motherfucker.

449
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,477
Goodbye. Have fun.

450
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,350
What the fuck, Dwayne?
You told me that was a replica gun.

451
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,152
Yeah, it was. Then I paid a Mexican
50 bucks to put a firing pin in it.

452
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,654
Now it goes boom.

453
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,232
Dude, we can't have a loaded gun
around that bomb.

454
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,651
Don't ever question me.

455
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,241
I'm fucking this bitch.
You're holding the camera.

456
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,995
- I'm saying you should have told me.
- This isn't the Marines.

457
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,874
If you hesitate, if you fuck around,
I will leave you behind.

458
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,874
Come on.
We've got some surveillance to do.

459
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,792
And possibly breakfast.

460
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,095
And this whole region here,
about 830,000 square miles...

461
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,844
was part of the original
Louisiana Purchase.

462
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,758
- Nice laser.
- Yeah.

463
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,177
It's a nice laser, Rodney.

464
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,516
You know what's not nice?
Texting in my class.

465
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,523
"Hey, Steve, what time
you watching the UFC fight, bro?

466
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:25,027
By the way, do you think Lisa
would go out with me'?"

467
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,813
Lisa over there? No way.
She's laughing in your face.

468
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,695
Don't text in my class any more, okay?

469
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,870
Everyone, take out your workbooks.

470
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,197
- What do you want?
- We got to talk.

471
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:41,039
- I'm at work. Don't mess with me...
- Please talk to me for one minute.

472
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,372
I'll be right back. Just do stuff.

473
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,418
Well, well, well.
Look who wants to apologize.

474
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,053
It's gonna take lot more
than pathetic groveling.

475
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,051
I don't want to apologize to you.

476
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,508
We have nothing left to say
to each other.

477
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,435
Two guys jumped me
and strapped a bomb to my chest...

478
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,097
and now I have less than nine hours
to rob a bank.

479
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,062
You're hysterical. Great joke.
I'm gonna go back.

480
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,977
- All right, what is this?
- Don't touch it.

481
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,736
- What the fuck? Is that thing real?
- I am not fucking around here.

482
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,492
And if I don't rob that bank,
this thing's gonna blow.

483
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,989
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

484
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:19,457
And your first thought was to come
to a school filled with young children?

485
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,954
Well, I guess
I didn't really think about it.

486
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,456
- Just back away.
- Okay.

487
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,169
- Back away, back away, back away.
- Okay. I think the vest is safe for now.

488
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,426
These guys don't want me to blow up
before I get them their money.

489
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,427
Yeah, you figure
the two psychopaths...

490
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,214
that put a bomb on your chest
made sure it was safe?

491
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,508
There's no margin for error
in their design?

492
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,344
I don't know.
All I do know is that this is real, okay?

493
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,061
This is real. This is happening,
but I have nowhere else to go.

494
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,022
- For what?
- I need your help, okay?

495
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,027
I can't do this alone.

496
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,735
Damn it.
I want to tell you to get fucked.

497
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,942
- I know.
- But I can't.

498
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,198
Because I'm a better man than you.

499
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,238
And if I let you go and you explode...

500
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,907
that shit will come back
and eat at my conscience.

501
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,623
And affect my relationships
with other people.

502
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:08,506
Like my future wife and kids,
and shit.

503
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,009
We'd be having a picnic or something
one day and I would just be like:

504
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,216
"Oh, damn it, I shouldn't have let Nick
explode that time."

505
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:19,183
That's a very rational way
to look at the situation.

506
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,353
And you're right.
About being a better man than me.

507
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,932
Could you walk a few feet
in front of me?

508
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,484
Yeah. I can do that.

509
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,236
Thank you.

510
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:47,203
- What's up, baby?
- Chango, I missed you.

511
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,544
Right on. Did you miss me?

512
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,880
- Of course I missed you.
- Don't lie to me.

513
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,545
The guys in there get Juicy,
but you get Jacqueline.

514
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,214
Cool. Well, here's what I want.

515
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,554
First, I want my money. Then I want
to kill that old motherfucker.

516
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,185
Then get the fuck out of here.

517
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,685
Well, that's how it's gonna go.
We're just waiting for the call.

518
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,726
This is what I'm doing right here.
See my impatient face?

519
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,985
See my impatient face right here?

520
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,521
Well...

521
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:17,612
I think I can keep you entertained.
Come on, baby.

522
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,868
That's nice.

523
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,741
What if we saw off your arms...

524
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,622
slip the vest over your head,
then go to the hospital?

525
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,124
They'll reattach your arms.

526
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,503
- We'll keep your arms on ice.
- Fuck that.

527
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,252
I don't know, man.
These sites say different shit.

528
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,175
Not a lot of consensus
in the bomb-disarming community.

529
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,720
- What did they do in The Hurt Locker?
- I don't know, I didn't see it.

530
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,428
Yeah, me neither.
I Netflixed it six months ago.

531
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,059
It's been sitting on my coffee table.
It's so dumb.

532
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,562
I pay $12.99 a month and keep the
same movies and never watch them.

533
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,144
Shut up.
Please, just keep looking online, okay?

534
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,686
You can't expect me
to be a bomb-disarming expert...

535
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,355
after looking online
for five minutes.

536
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,780
Shit, it's too tight.

537
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,656
Last thing I looked up online was how
to make a quiche, and I fucked it up.

538
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,739
Can you please take this seriously,
okay?

539
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,907
This is scaring the shit out of me.

540
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,037
These guys said
they'd be following me.

541
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,838
- They could be anywhere. No, we can't.
- Call the cops.

542
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,718
If they see the cops show up, they
blow the vest and out their losses.

543
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,552
- What do I do, Chet? What do I do?
- I don't know, man.

544
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,801
I guess you gotta just rob the bank.

545
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,928
Fuck. Fuck.

546
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,393
It's gonna be okay.

547
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,650
No, it's not gonna be okay.
I'm gonna fucking blow up.

548
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,436
Come on.

549
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,775
- Get yourself together.
- Fuck, Chet.

550
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,698
- You know how to rob a bank.
- What are you talking about?

551
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,529
Point Break. That movie's
a how-to guide for bank robberies.

552
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,948
You just bust in, masks,
guns, move fast, stick to the tellers...

553
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,250
and don't bother with the vault.

554
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,707
Yeah, you're right.
I guess it is pretty simple.

555
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,997
It's a local bank.
It's the Donner-Wells.

556
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,583
The one by the Olive Garden?
That's my bank.

557
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,344
Small, standard security.
Totally manageable for one dude.

558
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,840
One dude? You mean,
you're not gonna do it with me?

559
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:08,769
No, but I'm happy to give tips, advice,
motivational speeches.

560
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,646
Oh, Chet, please. Jesus Christ,
I need you on this, okay?

561
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,684
I can't do this alone.
If I do it alone, I'm dead. Please.

562
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,529
Okay, just tell me this.

563
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,403
How many times
did you sleep with my sister?

564
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,656
Just once, I swear to God.
Graduation night.

565
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,244
Okay. I'll help you on one condition.

566
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,158
You never mention my sister again...

567
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,326
and you never speak
to my sister again.

568
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,997
Okay.

569
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:42,128
Okay, yes. We can do this.

570
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,590
I don't think we should use panty hose.
You'd see our faces.

571
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,723
- Ski masks. Perfect.
- Perfect.

572
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,807
All right, fuck the knee-highs.

573
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,143
Okay, here we are. Should we get
the handguns or the Uzis?

574
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,684
- What do you think?
- These look pretty real.

575
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,398
Get down on the grou...

576
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,030
Get down on the ground
and give me the money.

577
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,988
How am I supposed to get the money
if I'm on the ground?

578
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,323
Get me the money
then get down on the ground.

579
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,533
I'll be right back.

580
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,794
Dude, you totally fucked up
this mixtape.

581
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,506
We're not a bunch of frat guys trying
to finger-bang girls to Matchbox 20.

582
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,591
We're trying to mastermind
a heist here.

583
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:29,224
It should be, like, some industrial shit,
some fucking German techno.

584
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,635
Sorry, Dwayne.
That song means a lot to me.

585
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,554
It doesn't mean a lot to me.
It means a headache to me.

586
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,857
I just want this guy
to fucking hurry up.

587
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,685
Are you worried about the other guy,
the mini genie?

588
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,770
No, man,
he picked him up from a school.

589
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,189
As long as he's not a cop.

590
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,825
He can bring the whole fucking faculty.
As long as he gets my money.

591
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,410
- Check that.
- What are you looking at, Subway?

592
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,709
Do you want me to run and get
sandwiches? I'm hungry as shit.

593
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,708
Look. It would be the perfect place
for the tanning salon.

594
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,295
- You're so right.
- Yeah.

595
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,376
I've been doing a lot of thinking...

596
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,137
and I want you to start out
at the front counter.

597
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,386
It sounds like a demotion. It's not.
It's a very important job.

598
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,093
We're gonna be using
a lot of code words and shit.

599
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,307
For what?

600
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,597
Well, say a gentleman
walks in and says:

601
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,936
"Hello, good afternoon. I'd like a tan."

602
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,563
- That just means that he wants a tan.
- Okay.

603
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,855
But if a guy comes in and is like,
"Yo, I want a deluxe tan."

604
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,862
That means he wants a tan
and a blowjob...

605
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,322
which means you
have to go to the back...

606
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,532
- And blow him?
- No.

607
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,663
You find a girl
who's gonna suck him off.

608
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,994
Okay.

609
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,125
Guns.

610
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,545
Masks.

611
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,589
You sure y'all
don't wanna grab some condoms?

612
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,091
No. Why?

613
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,005
Because this is usually what men buy
before they rape someone.

614
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,217
We're not rapists.

615
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,723
Us two small fries? No way.

616
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,634
Cash or credit for your rape kit?

617
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,353
Hey.

618
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,513
Is a Slider Station in a rape kit?

619
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,024
- We're getting one of those too.
- We'll pay cash.

620
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,900
Not into rape, just into sliders.

621
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,026
- If it's anal, is it a hard anal tan?
- No, the "anal" will tip it off too much.

622
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,691
Oh, right.
What if a black guy comes in?

623
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,360
Would he get a Tanny Glover?

624
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,120
No, we're not going to profile,
racially, our clients.

625
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,907
We don't say anything
if it's a black guy who comes in.

626
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,452
If a dude comes and wants a black
chick that would be a Tanny Glover.

627
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,130
We'll have codes for that. Codes
for missionary, for anal, black chicks.

628
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,792
I have a glossary of terms
in my files back at home.

629
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,585
I'm not gonna go into that now...

630
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,925
because you
are supposed to be on lookout.

631
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,806
And I know how terrible you are
with multitasking.

632
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,093
- They're getting away, dude.
- Shit.

633
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,429
Hurry up. Go, go, go.

634
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,690
Enough, Travis. I'm sick
of this fucking Family Dollar bullshit.

635
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,101
It's time to get our heads
in the game.

636
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,153
Painting the guns
Painting the guns.

637
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,610
Painting the guns
For the bank robbery.

638
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,782
Because if we go in
With our plastic guns.

639
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,740
Then the cops will shoot us in our face
If we go in with...

640
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,622
Please be careful.
You're getting paint all over the car.

641
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,454
You're worried about this car?

642
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,752
- Yeah.
- Your car is a total piece of shit.

643
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,537
- Please.
- No, your car is garbage.

644
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,502
It's like you bought a Mustang
and the Mustang got AIDS.

645
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,879
- And you're worried about paint in it?
- Yeah.

646
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,919
- Fine.
- Don't turn that over, still wet.

647
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:15,307
- This is fast-drying.
- Fast isn't instant. Let it sit.

648
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,010
We don't have time to sit around
and watch paint dry.

649
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,144
Aren't we headed
straight to the bank?

650
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,891
I was actually thinking we gotta stop
and steal a car first.

651
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,354
What, why? We have a car.

652
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,111
We have my car.
I can't use this as a getaway vehicle.

653
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,567
They'll trace the plates.
We'll be arrested.

654
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,991
How? I don't know
how to hot-wire a vehicle.

655
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,368
Do you know
how to hot-wire a vehicle?

656
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,949
That's why we gotta stop...

657
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,082
and steal the one from
your parents' friends, the Fishers.

658
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,334
They used to pay us
to clean their garage.

659
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:46,042
- They've got a Datsun. That's fast.
- I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun.

660
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,457
Let's steal
one of your parents' friends' cars.

661
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,875
Okay.

662
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,721
What friends? What friends?
My parents don't have any.

663
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,553
My dad moved away when
your mouth ruined his marriage...

664
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:01,141
and no one wants to hang out
with the mom who fucked a lifeguard.

665
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,725
You never should have told me.
I was 13 years old.

666
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,856
I couldn't process information
like that.

667
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:10,236
I thought it was cool your mom
fucked a lifeguard. Fuck, I'm sorry.

668
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,815
Okay. I accept your apology.

669
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,695
That's it? You're not gonna apologize
for sleeping with my sister?

670
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,535
- You told me not to mention it.
- Great.

671
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,579
I just want this goddamn day
to be over.

672
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,965
- It's locked.
- Fuck.

673
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,894
- Crawl through the window.
- You climb through the window.

674
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,099
I'm holding the bag.

675
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,606
I'm holding the bomb.
Climb through the window.

676
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,359
Yeah, just knock that shit down.

677
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,990
These are my work pants.
I don't want to ruin them.

678
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,776
Okay.

679
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,952
- You all right? Okay.
- Yeah, I'm great.

680
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,922
- Who is it?
- Shut up.

681
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,880
The keys aren't here.
They used to leave the keys.

682
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,219
Yeah, when we were teenagers.

683
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,975
Okay. All right, let's just find them.

684
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,189
Wait, did you hear that?

685
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,154
No. What?

686
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,372
- Mr. Fisher's coming.
- What?

687
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,410
- Put it on.
- What are you doing?

688
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,998
I'm doing what I have to.

689
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,626
Hold on.
Yes, okay, shut the door.

690
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,211
- Shit, shit, shit.
- Good.

691
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,761
Okay. Now, what...

692
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,638
- Where are the keys?
- In my pocket.

693
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,637
Quiet down and give them to me.

694
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,640
- I'm just getting them out of my pocket.
- Toss them to me.

695
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,682
Good. Okay, now, listen,
we're obviously stealing the car.

696
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,814
I don't want you to report it until later
tonight. Say 5:00, 6 to be safe.

697
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,316
- 6:15.
- Yeah, right, 6:15.

698
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,365
Don't even bother calling the cops.
We own the cops.

699
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,485
Good. Okay.

700
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,949
And if you mess with us,
I swear to God I will...

701
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,910
- I will shoot your son.
- Dylan Fisher.

702
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,166
Yes, Dylan Fisher.
I know where he works.

703
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,834
He works at the travel agency.

704
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,166
- The douche bag with the bangs.
- That's right.

705
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,502
Don't do that. I won't say a thing.
Just leave Dylan alone.

706
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,838
Okay, good,
but if you call the cops...

707
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,005
there's gonna be an undertaker
styling his stupid bangs.

708
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,343
- Because he'll be dead.
- Right, he'll be dead.

709
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,634
Now open the fucking garage door.

710
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,307
Do you have any snacks,
like granola bars or yogurts?

711
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,816
- Not now, not now.
- I'm hungry.

712
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,896
Okay, remember our deal,
6:15 and not a minute earlier.

713
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,359
- Yeah, please just go.
- Move over.

714
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,899
I'm driving.

715
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:06,204
Thanks. Have a great afternoon.

716
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:17,040
Oh, man, I'm totally implicated.
What if he saw my brown hands?

717
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,085
There's only four Indian families
that live in Grand Rapids.

718
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,924
The guy's not Matlock. He's Fisher.

719
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,963
He's a CPA. I think you'll be okay.

720
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,516
I'm inside a smaller car
with you and a bomb.

721
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,889
Next time,
why don't we steal a Smart Car?

722
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,513
This thing's got some pickup.

723
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,349
You just ran a stop sign.
Just take it easy, all right?

724
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,062
- We got plenty of time.
- I know.

725
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,149
- There's something I want to do first.
- Get something to eat.

726
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,531
Thank you. Let's go to Mr. Burger.

727
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,527
Actually,
I want to go tell my boss to fuck off.

728
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,950
What? Are you joking?

729
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,911
You want to run a personal errand
on our way to a robbery?

730
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,083
- You wanted to go get lunch.
- I'm hungry.

731
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,916
Nice to have one last burger
before I'm incarcerated.

732
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,873
This is not a personal errand.
This is important to me.

733
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,792
Okay,
and so this is your big moment?

734
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,428
Putting in your two-weeks' notice
at a pizza place?

735
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,054
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

736
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,841
You're making me depressed.
Let's go.

737
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,057
- I need to take a piss there, though.
- All right.

738
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,314
What are you doing?
It's gross back here. Park out front.

739
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,234
You had to take a piss.
Welcome to our employee restroom.

740
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,654
Fine. Hurry up, it smells
like dead animals and pizza out here.

741
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,106
Okay.

742
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,658
Yeah, man.
We're fucking taking care of business.

743
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,819
Hey, hey, hey.

744
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,656
Shit.
Where the fuck is this guy going to?

745
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,576
Is there some secret
FBI headquarters around here?

746
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,915
You know what?
Maybe I'll just call this bomb.

747
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,876
What? No, dude. No.

748
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,132
Let me go after him
and take a look. Jesus.

749
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,758
"Jesus."

750
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,885
Hell,
you gay for this guy or something?

751
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,133
What? Yeah.

752
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,969
If wanting a lot of money is gay,
yeah, I'm Elton John.

753
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,175
Then hurry up.
Go do some reconnaissance.

754
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,356
Report back,
or I will blow this motherfucker up.

755
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,283
Kate, I'm outside your building.

756
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,285
No, no, I'm here right now.

757
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,867
- Why are you acting strange?
- Shit is going on.

758
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,545
- I'll explain. Just meet me.
- I was about to go. What's going on?

759
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:20,963
Please, it's important.

760
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,383
Nick.

761
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,173
- Yeah.
- What's going on? You okay?

762
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,138
Wait, just stay over there, okay?
Please.

763
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,099
Listen,
something happened last night.

764
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,806
I was out on this run and ...

765
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,896
Well, I started thinking:

766
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,482
"What if this is the last pizza
I ever deliver?"

767
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,317
I'd say it's probably a good thing.

768
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,074
I'm super busy right now.
This is not the best time.

769
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,859
Right now is kind of all I have.

770
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,196
- Come by and we'll talk.
- There isn't time.

771
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,283
Okay, can I tell you
the single worst mistake of my life?

772
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,167
Okay.

773
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,829
- It was sleeping with you.
- Thanks.

774
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,874
No, that's when I knew for sure
that I was in love with you.

775
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,761
What I didn't know was how the fuck
to deal with it, so I screwed it all up.

776
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,088
- That was, like, eight years ago.
- I know.

777
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:15,135
But I just want you to know
that if today was the final day...

778
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,306
of my brief and shitty existence...

779
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,191
and I could only see
one more person...

780
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,483
it would be you. Nick.

781
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,064
I gotta go.

782
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,781
Wait, you can't just say all this
and walk away.

783
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,287
Unfortunately, I have to.

784
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,327
Also, I told Chet we had sex.

785
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,375
What the fuck?

786
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,624
I think it's his girlfriend.
They've been up there for a while.

787
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:46,049
Homeboy's trying to get one last
blowjob in case he don't make it.

788
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,254
I like his style.

789
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,835
Yeah.

790
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,138
- What's up? I'm just fixing the banister.
- Cool.

791
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,300
Yeah, we got the banister
under control.

792
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,974
Yo, Juicy, what's happening?
This is King Dwayne.

793
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,976
I have been thinking about you a lot.

794
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,233
And I don't know,
I just feel cool inside.

795
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:07,567
I'm excited to get this money and me
and you to kind of start our thing.

796
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,028
I've been thinking a lot about
the polishing-the-scepter deal.

797
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,740
I know that's not really polishing.
You're talking about sucking my dick.

798
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,621
But I just want you to know
that it's gonna be mutual.

799
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,250
You won't just have to polish my
scepter, I will also lick your crown...

800
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:24,913
which is a euphemism
for, you know, eating your pussy.

801
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,831
Give me a call
when you get a chance.

802
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,875
Okay, goodbye.

803
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,090
Did my penis shrink to 12 inches?
You're early for your shift.

804
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,725
No, Chris, I quit. Fuck you.

805
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,557
Fuck.

806
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,471
Fuck you.

807
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,823
- You were in there almost 20 minutes.
- Yeah, I had a lot of shit to air.

808
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,199
Mr. Burger? Get me one?

809
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,904
- I did, but you took so long, I ate it.
- Oh, come on.

810
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,118
Give me one
of those 5-hour Energy fuckers.

811
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,535
- I drank those too.
- Motherfucker.

812
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,921
- Let's go.
- Let's go rob the bank.

813
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,798
And get this fucking bomb off.

814
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,426
I can't believe this.

815
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,842
You go for the money.
I'll cover the crowd.

816
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,600
I'm not feeling great.

817
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,060
I drank three 5-hour Energy drinks,
and it's just too much energy.

818
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,146
I'm cramping up from all the energy,
my arms are jittery.

819
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,231
Dude, settle down.
You ready for this?

820
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,736
- Yes.
- Let's do it, come on.

821
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,067
- Wait.
- What?

822
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,109
What do I call you in there
if I need to tell you something?

823
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,448
- Call me Tivon, you be Darius.
- I can tell you're not a black guy.

824
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,285
All right. You're still Darius, I'm Luis.

825
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,451
What if we're both Hispanic?
Like, we met in a gang in prison.

826
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,621
I like that. We stabbed a guard,
escaped, now we're on the run.

827
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,461
Yes, two loco motherfuckers
and that's how we roll in.

828
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,466
- Nothing's getting in our way.
- Wait.

829
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,468
- What?
- I don't have a Hispanic name.

830
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,470
Oh, yeah. You're Cruz.

831
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,140
That's a great fucking name.

832
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,592
Let's do this.

833
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,021
- Bank robbery, fools.
- Put your hands in the air.

834
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,643
No, get down on the ground.

835
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,849
Listen to him
and get on the ground.

836
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,519
Hey, back away.
All you guys, back away.

837
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,155
Don't think about it.
Nobody press the button.

838
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,986
I'll shoot one of these people.

839
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,785
Now get over there
and get on the ground. Now, go, go, go.

840
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,080
- Stand there, don't do shit.
- On the ground.

841
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,115
Key lime, look down.

842
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,950
Don't make any sudden moves,
okay?

843
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,456
Mustache, stop looking at my face.

844
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,039
We killed a guard,
we're not afraid to kill again.

845
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,090
We stabbed him in the eye
with a spoon.

846
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,128
Now, slowly, get down
and take your gun out and toss it.

847
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,633
- Come on, quicker.
- All right.

848
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,057
- No.
- What the fuck?

849
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,512
I don't want this gun.

850
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,594
- You do that on purpose?
- An accident.

851
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,019
Are you working together?

852
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,099
- Please take this gun away.
- Just toss it, lady.

853
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,814
Fuck.

854
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:00,527
I think she hit the femoral artery.

855
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:04,618
I'm so sorry, it was an accident.

856
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,158
Fuck you. Who slides a gun like that?

857
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,540
This guy just got shot. He's gonna die
and we're going to prison.

858
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,501
Luis and Cruz
are never going back.

859
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,792
Why isn't anybody getting me help?

860
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,465
- Let me see where you're hit.
- He's dangerous.

861
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,550
It's just a flesh wound. You're okay.

862
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,598
Cruz,
how are we doing on that money?

863
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,054
Cruz.

864
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,719
Oh, sorry, Luis.

865
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,559
Don't make a sound.

866
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,599
- You, what's your name?
- Sandra.

867
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,565
All right, Sandra, you just get us a bag
with $100,000.

868
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,695
We'll grab it. No one will get hurt.

869
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:37,943
Can I trust you?

870
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,403
All right, let's go.
Let's get some money.

871
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,364
Cruz,
you're breaking your own rules.

872
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,071
- Not the vault, stick to the tellers.
- Right.

873
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:49,121
I don't have that much at the counter.
I have to go in the vault.

874
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,126
Fuck it. Go to the vault, let's go.

875
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,083
Go, go, go. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

876
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,839
- My leg really hurts.
- This guy's leg really hurts.

877
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,292
Quickly, Sandra.

878
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,468
A dude's been fucking shot.

879
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,012
- Hurry, please.
- Come on, time is money here.

880
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,305
Get me help, somebody.

881
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,809
You wanna get shot in the other knee?
Didn't think so, keep it down.

882
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,352
Okay.

883
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,600
- Okay, I got it.
- Good.

884
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:11,855
Thank you, Sandra.

885
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:15,310
I'm sorry, everybody.
I know we probably fucked up your day.

886
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,646
I'm thinking of you in particular, sir.

887
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:21,066
Actually, you know what?
Here, peel a few bills off, on me.

888
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,277
Anybody rats this guy,
I'm coming after you, I remember faces.

889
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,613
- Right, Cruz?
- He remembers faces.

890
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,038
There you go, sir.

891
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,666
Sandra, what was that?
What happened to our trust?

892
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,338
I'm sorry, they make us do it.

893
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,465
Hey, Sandra, we need you here.
We all do.

894
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,422
So would you please fill another bag?

895
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,929
And not a bank bag this time,
a garbage bag. Cruz, watch her.

896
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,804
Let's go, come on.
And none of your antics this time.

897
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:50,394
Go, go, fill it up. I'm watching you.

898
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,937
We're not friends no more.

899
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,399
Give me the bag, quickly.

900
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,068
Thanks, Sandra.

901
00:48:58,227 --> 00:48:59,820
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go.

902
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,357
Which one of you assholes
tripped the alarm?

903
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,366
Sandra,
don't tell me you did that too.

904
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,153
No, it was Mark. He pushed
the button when you came in.

905
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,663
Sandra, you bitch.
They're gonna kill both of us.

906
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,701
- Fuck you, you're the manager.
- No, fuck both of you.

907
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,661
I am a regular guy.
And you fucked me.

908
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:20,842
So thank you
for fucking a regular guy.

909
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,503
And his partner, Cruz.

910
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,759
That's right,
Donner-Wells, you got robbed.

911
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,846
- Oh, fuck.
- Drop your weapons.

912
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,222
- Yes, sir.
- Fuck.

913
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,270
Put your hands on your head.

914
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,599
Now, slowly,
get your ass on the ground.

915
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,308
Do it now.

916
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,646
Guess what, you just brought a gun
to a bomb fight, officer.

917
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,282
I pull these wires, we all go, you got
10 seconds to drop your weapon.

918
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,159
- One, two.
- Oh, fuck this.

919
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,039
I can't believe that worked.
That was awesome.

920
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,326
He was tempting
a desperate motherfucker.

921
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:01,841
Holy shit, homeboy's got
the Federales in hot pursuit.

922
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,756
- There's police cars chasing us.
- Well, we just robbed a bank.

923
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,066
- Can't outrun these guys in a Datsun.
- I can, I do this for a living.

924
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,068
No, you don't. You deliver pizzas.

925
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,270
- That's nothing like this.
- Hang on.

926
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,529
Tokyo Drift away from them
or something.

927
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,582
Fuck. One guy spun out,
the other guy ...

928
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,294
Never mind,
keep going, keep going, keep going.

929
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,509
- Hang on.
- What are you doing?

930
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,178
Bang a 180,
blow by them in the opposite direction.

931
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,055
No, don't bang. No need for a bang.

932
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,099
Ready? Hang on.

933
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,351
Okay.

934
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,982
- We're facing the same direction.
- I overshot it.

935
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,980
Oh, go, go, go.

936
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,235
He's right behind us.

937
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,706
The stoplight, please stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

938
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,501
That guy got fucked up.

939
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,675
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

940
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,340
We gotta keep moving, come on.

941
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,437
All right, come on. Okay.

942
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,099
- Take the money. Take the money.
- Okay, thanks.

943
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,644
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

944
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,105
Look at this.
Look what happened to the Datsun.

945
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,031
Mr. Fisher is not gonna be pleased.

946
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,487
- The cops are coming, come on.
- Oh, shit.

947
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,911
- Hold on.
- We're trying to get away.

948
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,946
Okay, okay, I'm getting away.

949
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,287
- Got a piece of the car stuck in you.
- What?

950
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,498
- Where?
- It's in your back, I'll get it.

951
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,921
- Get it out, please.
- Stay still.

952
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,374
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna get tetanus now.

953
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,962
- Was it rusty?
- Come on.

954
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,304
Okay, what do we do now?
What should we do now?

955
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,555
Bus, bus.

956
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,761
Slow down, slow down.

957
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,468
Hey, please stop.

958
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,225
Thank you.

959
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,942
Police Department officials say
unidentified suspects...

960
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,735
..-one, possibly both,
of Hispanic descent...

961
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:38,998
entered the bank,
taking a substantial amount of cash.

962
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,581
Hey. You know what happened
to the guys they were after?

963
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,336
It sounds like they got away.

964
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,749
That's terrible.
I hope that they catch them.

965
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,215
There is 100 grand in here.

966
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:56,595
A hundred fucking grand, man,
which we stole from a bank.

967
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,226
I told people I was gonna shoot them.
I was like:

968
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:02,889
- "Move, I'll kill you where you stand."
- I threatened to blow up a cop.

969
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,395
You never said,
"I'll kill you where you stand."

970
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,230
- But shit did get crazy.
- Yeah.

971
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,862
- Held my gun sideways at one point.
- Yeah, you did.

972
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,360
There is no one I would have rather
taken down a bank with, I mean that.

973
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,244
Me neither.

974
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:22,249
As for all that shit I said and that shit
I did, I just hope you can forgive me.

975
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,294
I don't think anybody else
would be friends with me.

976
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:29,673
You're talking to a guy who slept
with his best friend's ex-girlfriend...

977
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,631
split up his parents' marriage,
sat on the sidelines...

978
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,795
watched him go through
a downward spiral.

979
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,181
Those are the actions
of a shitty human being.

980
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,092
I don't know who else
would be best friends with me.

981
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,557
Then it's good we know each other.
Come here.

982
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,314
- You still have a bomb strapped.
- Yeah, you're right.

983
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,850
- But you owe me a hug.
- Sure.

984
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:52,488
The 'stang.
I didn't think I'd see you again.

985
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,485
It's all gravy from here.

986
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,996
One hundred thousand dollars,
done and done.

987
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,585
This who I think it is?

988
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,387
Can't you hear the ticking
in the background?

989
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,135
Funny guy, huh?

990
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:23,269
Well, can it, this shit ain't over yet.
Save the fucking routine.

991
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,351
There's an old rail road bridge
on Commerce, past the highway.

992
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,641
- Be there in 20.
- I'll be there in 10.

993
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:32,023
Be standing with your dick in one hand
and my money in the other.

994
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,275
No, you will... Hello?

995
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,236
No, he heard it.

996
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,534
Fucking asshole.

997
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,991
Juicy, yeah, wrangle your boy.
Money's on its way.

998
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,704
Goddamn.
How good does this shit feel, huh?

999
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,630
It's good as shit, dude.

1000
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,298
Fucking victory tacos, dude.

1001
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,834
I'm not ashamed to admit it, Travis.

1002
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,637
I've had some dark times
these last few years.

1003
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:03,142
There was depression,
anorexia, addiction...

1004
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,304
and all kinds of shit
that I'm not gonna even go into.

1005
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,144
Starting today,
all that shit's the past.

1006
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,852
I finally fucking done it, man.
I finally pulled it off.

1007
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:16,230
Yeah, I mean, we did, dude.
Together, you and me.

1008
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,525
- We make a pretty good team.
- Do we?

1009
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,859
- Yeah, dude.
- Yeah?

1010
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:27,416
All right, then. Would you do it?

1011
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,830
- Would you push the button?
- Why would you want me to do that?

1012
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,883
- It's just a question, Travis.
- You said nobody gets hurt, Dwayne.

1013
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,180
He hasn't even made the drop,
anyway, so ...

1014
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,592
I wouldn't ask you to blow him up
right now, that'd be stupid.

1015
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,302
Not while we're eating tacos.

1016
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,723
I gotta take a shit, dude.

1017
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:55,194
Hola, Marcela.
Aren't you looking muy Caliente today?

1018
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,033
Wait. Did you tell the guy
you're bringing a friend?

1019
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,660
No.

1020
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,997
What if he gets freaked out
and decides to shoot me?

1021
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,407
You wanna go?

1022
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,326
- Yes.
- You got my blessing.

1023
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,227
You know what?
Enough about your uncle touching you.

1024
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:32,272
I don't wanna hear it any more.
He touched you, get over it.

1025
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,604
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up, bro?

1026
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,234
How are you doing?

1027
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,816
- Where are the other guys?
- It's just me, dog.

1028
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:42,199
You can call me Sugar Milk, bro.
Sugar Milk.

1029
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,609
- Sugar Milk?
- Yeah, yeah.

1030
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,494
- You got the money?
- Yeah, yes.

1031
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,790
Oh, my God, it's so pretty.

1032
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,701
It's so pretty, bro. Look at it.

1033
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,041
Oh, my God.
What did you do? Rob a bank?

1034
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,456
- Yeah.
- You did?

1035
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,466
- Yeah.
- All right, that's cool, man.

1036
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:03,675
- I'm proud of you. Check you later.
- Wait. Hey, man, where's the code?

1037
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,724
I don't know no code. What code?

1038
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,227
Just give me the code, okay?

1039
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,397
Like Da Vinci Code, like code red,
like the "Contra" code?

1040
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:17,526
Like, "Up, down, up, down, select, select,
A, B, A, B, left, right, left, right"?

1041
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,153
Stop messing with me.
Just give me the code, okay?

1042
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,822
No, I don't have no code, bro.

1043
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,740
Give me the code for the bomb,
okay?

1044
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,952
Who brings a fucking bomb
to a drop, homey?

1045
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,450
Your boss put this on me.

1046
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,874
- I am my boss.
- Good, then give me the code.

1047
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,793
Say "code" again, please.
Say it one more time, say it.

1048
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,499
- No.
- I'll shoot you in the face.

1049
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:39,336
I'll shoot you so you don't explode
and mess up my shit.

1050
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,717
Say "code" one more time.
I wanna hear it.

1051
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:42,922
I want the money back.

1052
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,469
- You want this money?
- Yes.

1053
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:48,804
- This money that you just gave to me?
- Yes, give me the money back.

1054
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,601
The only way you're gonna get it
is if you kill to me.

1055
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,730
- Which you ain't gonna do.
- You don't know what I've been through.

1056
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,773
Do I fucking look sympathetic,
homey?

1057
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,102
Now step the fuck aside. Now.

1058
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,481
Chango, watch out.

1059
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,235
Wanna fuck with me, little man?

1060
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,283
There's a lady on top of me
Get this lady off me.

1061
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,828
She's biting my ear.
She's biting my ear.

1062
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,455
Get off my friend.

1063
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,085
- Shit, let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Get in the car. Chet.

1064
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,379
- You're a bad person.
- Get in the car.

1065
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,087
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1066
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,591
She's getting up, she's getting up,
she's getting up.

1067
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,302
Little bitches.

1068
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,182
- What the fuck was that?
- They tried to screw us, man.

1069
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,938
You were a liability,
they were gonna let you blow up.

1070
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,690
Not with the money, they won't.

1071
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,897
I'm gonna call that motherfucker.

1072
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,148
Yeah, shit's looking good.
Just don't make it too boxy, man.

1073
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:49,360
I'm not trying to look like Arsenio Hall
when I go and identify the body.

1074
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,028
Okay.

1075
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,656
Take this.

1076
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:57,284
Did you drop the money?

1077
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,621
No, I still got the money and
we cracked your friend's face open.

1078
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,508
- Why the fuck would you do that?
- You lied, you said I'd get the code.

1079
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,795
- He did not? I gave him the code.
- You didn't give him shit.

1080
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,971
The code,
or you'll never see this money.

1081
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,632
Just settle down, all right?

1082
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,888
You're not negotiating
from a point of leverage.

1083
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,268
I'm holding the money.

1084
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,892
I blow up, it blows up,
who has the leverage now?

1085
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,025
- Go ahead and press the button.
- What are you doing?

1086
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,397
- Don't tell him to push the button.
- Shut up.

1087
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,313
Watch what the fuck you're saying.
I own you, all right?

1088
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,984
If I tell you rob a bank, you rob a bank.
If I tell you to give me money...

1089
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,152
give me money
and hope I give you mercy.

1090
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,158
I'm tired of this. I'm already dead.

1091
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,949
Fuck you, I'll die rich.
I can't say the same for you.

1092
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,284
Get me out of the car.

1093
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:41,996
Pull over
and let me get out of the car right now.

1094
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,172
I'm getting out,
that's what's happening.

1095
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,878
- Let me out of the car.
- Chet.

1096
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,677
- I'm out of the car.
- Chet, get back in the car.

1097
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,803
Why? That was so stupid.

1098
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,927
That was a negotiation tactic, okay?

1099
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:56,219
He'll call back and I won't answer.
He'll call again and I will.

1100
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,012
The only way he gets the money
is if he gives the code.

1101
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,022
Okay, I'm sure that's what he'll do.

1102
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,684
Wait, no, it's not,
because he's a fucking psychotic.

1103
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,029
Now he's not gonna answer.
He's gonna pretend I don't exist.

1104
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,993
Does this guy not know
who the fuck I am?

1105
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:22,836
Goddamn it. Fucking shit.

1106
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,667
Dwayne.

1107
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,465
You never told me
you weren't gonna give him the code.

1108
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,510
We're not amateurs, all right?
He's a loose end, man.

1109
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,263
You know what happens
if you let a loose end go away?

1110
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,298
I could just be sitting
in my mansion...

1111
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,890
all of a sudden, the FBI, the CIA,
NASA, they'll all converge there.

1112
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:43,432
Because he's turned state's evidence
and he can fucking lock me away.

1113
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,853
You know what? Fuck that, fuck it.

1114
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,487
I'll kill the major myself.
I don't need a hit man.

1115
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,110
- Don't.
- I'm gonna smoke him.

1116
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,116
I gave him chances and he blew it.

1117
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:56,199
He wants to be an asshole, a big man.
He's gonna die now.

1118
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,450
Dwayne, don't.

1119
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,206
- Seriously, don't.
- Three, two...

1120
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,164
One, boom.

1121
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,452
I just killed somebody.

1122
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,122
Hello and welcome to Moviefone.

1123
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,508
To use
our new speech-enabled system ...

1124
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,512
Travis,
why the fuck was that Moviefone?

1125
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,217
What's the number for the bomb?

1126
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:17,595
It's in my head, man.

1127
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:21,057
I switched it out when you
were taking a shit at Taco Boy.

1128
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,562
You're out of control.

1129
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,644
- I'm out of control?
- Yeah.

1130
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,604
- I'm in perfect control.
- You're not.

1131
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,939
- Benedict Arnold, you little bitch.
- Stop it.

1132
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,821
You're a fucking traitor.
You're a traitor to me.

1133
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,399
Fuck. Stop it.

1134
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,491
Stop.

1135
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,663
Shit. You motherfucker.

1136
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,540
I make you my partner
and you pull this shit with me?

1137
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,620
I'm just tired of you
pushing me around, Dwayne.

1138
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,208
- What kind of partner does that?
- Fuck you.

1139
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,214
I'm gonna probably piss blood now.

1140
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:53,214
Yeah,
that's what it said on the Internet.

1141
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:57,844
Would you get the phone out?
I don't have the strength.

1142
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,308
Just put it on the table,
on speakerphone.

1143
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,233
Glad to see you finally came
to your senses, asshole.

1144
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,190
Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to, bro?

1145
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:12,942
Who is that?

1146
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,947
Honestly, I have no idea.
Who is this?

1147
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,650
Let me give you a little hint.

1148
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,036
Your bomb boy just jumped me,
tossed my bitch like a rag doll...

1149
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,865
and split with the cash.
Does that ring a bell?

1150
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:25,033
That's not my boy.
That dude is a dick.

1151
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,166
I'm sorry for the confusion
he might have caused us today.

1152
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,172
Confusion? The only motherfucker
who's confused is you.

1153
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,756
Because apparently, you think you
can fuck with my world and survive.

1154
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:38,263
I'm not trying to fuck up your world,
I'm trying to fuck up his world.

1155
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,392
Man, understand, you're like a pawn
I'm playing in a much larger game here.

1156
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,429
A pawn? Did you
just fucking call me a pawn, homey?

1157
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,893
I'm not a chess piece,
I'm like a battleship.

1158
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,443
I didn't mean it that way.
I'm just juggling a lot of shit right now.

1159
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,820
I don't give a fuck.
I want my money now.

1160
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,738
I don't have the money right now.

1161
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,400
If you give me a little time,
I can come up with it.

1162
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,905
Know what? The deal's off.

1163
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:03,197
You just became the hit.
Congratulations, motherfucker.

1164
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,668
What did he say? Are we good?

1165
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,920
He says he's gonna kill me.

1166
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,832
The fucking assassin
is now going to kill me.

1167
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,751
Oh, shit. Are you serious?

1168
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,761
He's gonna fucking shoot me now.
I'm gonna die, game over.

1169
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,843
Hey, come on, man, don't say that.

1170
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,049
We're gonna get the money
like we planned.

1171
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,977
We just have to get
the leverage back.

1172
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:29,978
- How do we do that?
- We hit that pizza fuck where it hurts.

1173
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:34,231
- What, in his dick?
- No, in his pussy.

1174
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:42,611
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- I know, please try it once.

1175
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,743
I'll try, if it doesn't work,
no more tactics, call the guy.

1176
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,373
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

1177
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,624
Okay.

1178
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,081
All right, three, two, one.

1179
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,293
Fuck. Fuck, man.

1180
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,675
- It's not working.
- Yeah, your arms are there.

1181
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,757
We need to out off your arms,
but you have to have your arms.

1182
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:00,966
Okay, I will try him.

1183
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:06,351
Yo, this is the king.
Leave a fucking message.

1184
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,352
It went straight to voicemail.

1185
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,854
What are we gonna do, man?

1186
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,233
If those guys don't pick up,
you're gonna explode.

1187
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:17,146
- In an hour, you'll be dead.
- All right, I'll call him again.

1188
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,285
- One of the best shows I ever saw.
- Be quiet.

1189
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:41,845
That's right.
Shit just got real for you, slumdog.

1190
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,595
- Who the fuck are you?
- Get her.

1191
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:49,099
Get your finger out of my ...

1192
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,232
- Have you lost your mind?
- Have you lost yours?

1193
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,735
Have you lost yours?

1194
01:04:58,186 --> 01:04:59,813
Dwayne?

1195
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:38,019
Chill out right there, homey.
Chill out right there.

1196
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,946
I'm gonna walk you through it.

1197
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,737
I'm just here for Dwayne, okay?
That's it.

1198
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,694
Even if I knew where he was,
I wouldn't tell you nothing.

1199
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,202
Don't be stupid, bro.
Come on, tell me.

1200
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,410
You know,
I saved a beaner's life in the shit.

1201
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,962
So if I took yours, we'd be even.

1202
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,249
A beaner, huh?

1203
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:03,544
That shit cuts deep, I'm not gonna lie.
That was good.

1204
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,387
Why are you trying to protect him?

1205
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,548
He hired me to kill you,
motherfucker.

1206
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,184
- Sounds like my son.
- Where is he?

1207
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,101
Where the fuck is he?

1208
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:21,691
You think I'm scared of death, huh?

1209
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,774
There's a whole generation of gooks
that think I'm the grim reaper.

1210
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,575
Come here, you.

1211
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:35,201
I'll ride you all the way to hell.
And I know just how to get there.

1212
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,586
Are you for serious, dog?

1213
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,919
- Nobody can fucking kill to me, bro.
- Go ahead and Shoo...

1214
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:53,264
Didn't think I was gonna do it, right?
People always do that shit.

1215
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,888
Really? A fucking pen gun?

1216
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,394
Motherfucker.

1217
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,322
You're a fucking badass, bro.
You're a pimp.

1218
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,863
Remember, you're a pimp.
That's what your ma said.

1219
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,077
Your ma told you you were a pimp.

1220
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,333
You're a pimp.

1221
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,771
Yeah.

1222
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,946
What the fuck is this shit?

1223
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,948
The scrapyard?

1224
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:56,702
I should just become a bank robber.
I was pretty good at it.

1225
01:07:56,864 --> 01:08:00,164
Teachers don't make shit.
Bank robbers make bank.

1226
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,211
- Hey, hey, it's them.
- Shit.

1227
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,464
- Don't mess this up.
- Okay.

1228
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:07,626
- Are you ready to talk now?
- Yeah, I'm ready, I want my money.

1229
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,633
Good, then give me the code.
I will disarm this thing.

1230
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:14,470
I will leave the money and you get it.
Trust me when I say I don't want it.

1231
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:18,683
Yeah, I'm sure, you're so ready
to get back to your fantastic life, huh?

1232
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:22,390
Your awesome job
and that sweet, hot little bitch of yours.

1233
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,150
What is that supposed to mean?

1234
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,607
The little lady
that you paid a visit to today?

1235
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,155
She's sitting in the back
of my van right now...

1236
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:31,112
let's say, it's not consensual.

1237
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,863
Fuck you. You crossed the line.

1238
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:36,446
There are no lines.
There's just me, you and $100,000.

1239
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:40,208
The sooner you figure that out, the
sooner you get her and your life back.

1240
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,503
- What did he say, man?
- Meet me in the scrapyard, alone.

1241
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:47,541
Try anything crazy, and both y'all
will be delivering pizzas to St. Peter.

1242
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:48,879
Let me talk to her.

1243
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,586
Fine. He wants to talk.

1244
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:55,474
- He wants to talk to me? What do I say?
- No, to her, he wants to talk to her.

1245
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,010
- Why would he wanna talk to you?
- Right, sorry.

1246
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:01,055
- Nick?
- Fuck, Kate, I am so sorry.

1247
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,769
It's okay. I'm fine.

1248
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:07,527
- I'm just really scared.
- Enough, she's wasting my minutes.

1249
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,564
She's just really gonna die
if you fuck this up, got it?

1250
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,775
Fuck.

1251
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:17,491
Nick, what's going on?
Who were you talking to?

1252
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,659
- I fucked up, Chet.
- What did you do?

1253
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,045
When we went into town earlier,
it wasn't just to tell off my boss.

1254
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:30,380
I mean, I did that too, but I saw Kate.

1255
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,632
While you had a bomb strapped to you?
Are you kidding me?

1256
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,591
I thought I was being careful.
I went to see her in case I exploded.

1257
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:41,432
- The guys followed me, I had no idea.
- Of course you didn't.

1258
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:45,561
- What was the one thing I asked you?
- I know.

1259
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,398
I helped you rob a bank, man.
I put a gun up to people's faces.

1260
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,281
I committed a crime, I could go to jail.
My whole life could be over.

1261
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,612
Okay, I know I fucked up, okay? But ...

1262
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,369
We have the money, okay?

1263
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,532
And as long as we have the money,
she is safe.

1264
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,787
Let's just stop arguing
and go get her.

1265
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,765
Stop it.

1266
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,996
- You got it?
- Yeah, just don't mess this up.

1267
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,188
Hey. Hello?

1268
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,484
Yo, I'm here, I made it.

1269
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:15,905
- How much time you got left?
- Four minutes and nine seconds.

1270
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,780
- That's cutting it a little close.
- All right.

1271
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,737
I got the cash,
so give me the code and Kate.

1272
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,539
Or maybe we can chill out,
wait for the money shot.

1273
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,289
That's very funny.
Now give me the fucking code.

1274
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:32,706
Fine, 69, 69, 69.

1275
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:37,005
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Man, don't judge me.

1276
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,133
It's my favorite sexual position.

1277
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,153
Yeah, how's that feel? Free man.

1278
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:59,483
I'm not free yet. Where is she?

1279
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:07,119
Come on, Travis, what the fuck, dude?
This is the signal.

1280
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,413
I'm coming.
She knocked over my soda.

1281
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:10,869
- Kate.
- Nick, is that you?

1282
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,500
- You're gonna be okay.
- A tearjerker, isn't it?

1283
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,002
- Come on, man, let her go.
- I will, in time.

1284
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,169
I want you to know my associate here
is rocking a flamethrower.

1285
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,130
Be cool, man. Do not be crazy.

1286
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,717
Yeah, unless you think you can outrun
a 25-foot flame, or a bullet.

1287
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,977
- Which you can't, FYI.
- No, it's impossible.

1288
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,229
- Do you want the money?
- Yes.

1289
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,352
- Give me the girl.
- Meet in the middle.

1290
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,268
- Yeah, sure.
- Move, woman.

1291
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,478
On the count of three.

1292
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,987
- One, two, three.
- Okay.

1293
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,618
It's okay, it's okay.

1294
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,036
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God.

1295
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,492
I am so sorry.

1296
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,577
- What's going on?
- You lovebirds.

1297
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,830
You go ahead
and go home now, it's over.

1298
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,004
I have this suspicion
that once we turn around...

1299
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,711
you're gonna put a bullet
in our backs and ...

1300
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,968
This is a guess:
He's gonna burn our bodies.

1301
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:04,256
They say great minds think alike.
I guess, in this case, so do we.

1302
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:07,016
I know. That's why I have a gun
pointed at you.

1303
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,850
Yeah, I got a sniper
and he's locked on you right now.

1304
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:14,016
His name is Cruz
and he's a loco motherfucker.

1305
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,021
Hey, Cruz.

1306
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,607
Yeah, right. Bullshit.

1307
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,897
How dumb do I look?

1308
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,573
Nice try. Yeah, a sniper.

1309
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,861
- Holy shit, Dwayne, on your forehead.
- What?

1310
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,163
A red dot.
You look like one of her people.

1311
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,616
- There's a what?
- Shit.

1312
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,661
- Oh, you son of a bitch.
- Thank you, Cruz.

1313
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,372
- Well played.
- All right, now, drop the gun.

1314
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,925
- Put it down, it's on your chest now.
- A fucking sniper.

1315
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,799
- And you too.
- I can't, it's attached to my backpack.

1316
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,134
- Can I just point it down?
- Yeah, that's fine.

1317
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,971
- Thanks.
- Now, we're gonna walk away.

1318
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,101
Try anything,
my sniper will shoot you.

1319
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:55,148
You're so tough, huh?
You had to use a sniper to outdo us.

1320
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,942
That's a pussy move. Suck it.

1321
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,353
- Who cares? We got the money.
- Yeah. Fuck them.

1322
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,984
Hey, I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

1323
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,359
Nick? Nick.

1324
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:11,198
Where are you going?
Don't leave the party just yet, hold up.

1325
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,490
Who the fuck are you?

1326
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,372
I'm the motherfucking
Satanic Hispanic, doggie.

1327
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,252
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck.

1328
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,876
We were looking for you.
We got your money here.

1329
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,669
- All right, throw it down.
- Yeah, it's yours, there you go.

1330
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:25,841
Hey, what the fuck, man?

1331
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,718
We paid you. Put the gun down.

1332
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,180
It's disappointing the way
you guys do business. It's fucked up.

1333
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,221
I got shot with a pen today.
With a fucking pen, bro.

1334
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,475
Right in my neck.

1335
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:39,563
And I got hit in the face with a crowbar
or something by the little kazoo guy.

1336
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:42,611
I don't know what you're talking about.
Take your money.

1337
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,273
I am,
and then tie up you two loose ends.

1338
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:46,528
We're not loose ends.

1339
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:49,069
Dumb motherfucker,
you're as loose as ends get.

1340
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,994
- Dwayne, what do we do?
- Torch him.

1341
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,250
What the fuck, bro? A flamethrower?

1342
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,293
- You motherfuckers.
- Dwayne!

1343
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,503
Nick, come on.
There we go, come on.

1344
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,347
I'll be right back.

1345
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,347
I'm a pimp.

1346
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,308
- Kate.
- What are you doing here?

1347
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,397
- I'm Cruz. Where's Nick?
- He ran off.

1348
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,607
What's going on?

1349
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,113
Motherfuckers are on fire.
We need to leave now.

1350
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,530
Hey.

1351
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,655
- I got the money.
- Okay, let's go.

1352
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,082
That's my money.

1353
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,084
Dwayne, I'm melting. I'm melting!

1354
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,257
- Travis. Travis!
- Oh, God!

1355
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,464
- Help me, Dwayne.
- I got you, buddy.

1356
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,470
Hang tough, here I come. I got you.

1357
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,722
I got you, buddy. I got you, buddy.

1358
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,232
Travis, Travis, Travis.

1359
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,648
Are you all right?
Are you okay, man?

1360
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,232
Yeah.

1361
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:11,026
Dwayne, you came back for me.
You said you never would.

1362
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,410
You did good. You didn't hesitate.

1363
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,331
That's what she said.

1364
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,244
Yeah, that is what she said.

1365
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,336
- It works there.
- It finally works.

1366
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,885
I'm gonna go put a bullet in that
asshole's face, go get our money back.

1367
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:32,422
- You gonna be able to get home okay?
- Yeah, I can.

1368
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,932
- Go fucking get him, dude.
- I will.

1369
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,514
- Good fucking work.
- Yeah, man.

1370
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,852
Go get our fucking money.

1371
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,935
- You had a bomb strapped to you?
- Yeah, but we got away.

1372
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,775
For the second time with the money.

1373
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:54,115
- So when you came to see me today ...
- Yeah. Yeah, I meant everything I said.

1374
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:59,157
- Way to get caught up in the moment.
- Oh, shit.

1375
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:03,081
You wanna fucking take
King Dwayne's money?

1376
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:04,461
You wanna fucking play?

1377
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,711
- This is not good.
- Go faster.

1378
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,917
Go, go, go.

1379
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:14,429
- Guess who, pizza boy.
- Yo, dude, pull over.

1380
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,883
- Get fucked.
- No, you don't understand.

1381
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:21,312
You don't understand.
I own this town.

1382
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:33,692
- Why did that van explode?
- That bomb I was telling you about?

1383
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:37,078
I typed in the code, reactivated it,
put it in that guy's van.

1384
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,531
What?
That's some John McClane shit, yes.

1385
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:42,450
- How did you remember the code?
- It doesn't matter.

1386
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:46,496
- Anyway, we are alive and we are rich.
- This money's gonna change my life.

1387
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,048
First, Grand Rapids Elementary?
Fuck you, kids.

1388
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,085
I'm done, okay?
I can do all the stuff I've wanted to do.

1389
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:55,718
Travel the world, spend a little time
in Italy, maybe summer in France.

1390
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,760
Sandra!

1391
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:44,571
Hello.

1392
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:48,078
Here at Major Tan, our specially
trained engineers are hard at work...

1393
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:51,366
developing new technologies
to harness the power of the sun.

1394
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:53,909
How's it going in here?

1395
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,620
It's our most advanced
tanning bed yet.

1396
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:59,590
But don't just take
this scientist's word for it.

1397
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,842
The proof is in the tan.

1398
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:06,881
But at Major Tan
it's not just about looking good.

1399
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,469
It's also about feeling good.

1400
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:11,977
Goddamn.

1401
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,934
That deluxe tan was fantastic.

1402
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:17,441
Our more-than-willing staff is ready
to provide for your every need...

1403
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,735
through our wide variety
of custom tans.

1404
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:25,487
The grande tan, the ultra-dark tan,
the barely legal tan, the facial tan.

1405
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,493
And my personal favorite,
the ménage-é-tan.

1406
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:33,908
We even offer our own brand
of patented tanning pleasure oils...

1407
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:38,291
that our female associates
are trained to apply.

1408
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,463
We love King Dwayne.

1409
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:47,430
Come on down to Major Tan where
we're proud to be a family business.

1410
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,590
That's what she said.
