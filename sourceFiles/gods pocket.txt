1
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:11,637
The working men of God's
Pocket are simple men.

2
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,940
They work. They follow their teams.

3
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:20,110
They marry and have children
who rarely leave the Pocket.

4
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,111
Everyone here has stolen
something from somebody else...

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,685
or when they were kids, they
set someone's house on fire...

6
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:35,430
or they ran away when they
should have stayed and fought.

7
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,772
They know who cheats at cards
and who slaps their kids around.

8
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:49,818
And no matter what anybody
does, they're still here.

9
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,038
And whatever they
are is what they are.

10
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,443
The only thing they can't forgive
is not being from God's Pocket.

11
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,068
Say it.

12
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,236
Say it.

13
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,404
Oh, your balls.

14
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,972
Oh... oh, my God.

15
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,440
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

16
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,575
It's good, right?

17
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,076
Oh, it's so good.

18
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,136
- Oh!
- Your cook's so good.

19
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,961
Mm.

20
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,197
You okay?

21
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,041
Great.

22
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,336
Jeanie.

23
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,638
Mickey, I know. You love me.

24
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,584
I do.

25
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,311
If Leon is going to work today,

26
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,941
I got to be down at Bird's
by 8:00 if he wants a ride.

27
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,583
Leon, honey, it's time for work.

28
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,123
All right.

29
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,117
Mickey's got to be to Bird's
by 8:00 if you want a ride.

30
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,897
Honey?

31
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,570
I'm up!

32
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,345
"Everyone here has stolen
something from somebody else,

33
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,048
or when they were kids, they
set someone's house on fire,

34
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,518
or they ran away when they
should have stayed and fought."

35
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,288
That Richard Shellburn's
got it right.

36
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,790
I don't know why writing
down what everybody knows

37
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,567
is any better than knowing
it in the first place.

38
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,063
If you were from
here, you'd get it.

39
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,555
That's what everyone tells me.

40
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,414
I don't know how you eat that
shit and still look so good.

41
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,013
You get sugar diabetes, they're
gonna cut your feet off.

42
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,059
Fuck you looking at?

43
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,972
Something to eat in the truck, hon.

44
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,081
See, I told you it'd
take me no time at all.

45
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,141
You got me ten minutes
late already.

46
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,157
Fuckin'...fuck it.

47
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,925
You mind spotting me 20 bucks?

48
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,928
They start on one end, and
the air in Camden is so bad

49
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,330
and it takes so fucking long
to get to the other end

50
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,199
that by then, the
paint is all peeling,

51
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,735
and they got to go back
and start all over again.

52
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:08,374
Year after year, painting the same
fucking bridge over and over.

53
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,775
It's like a nightmare.

54
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,346
Ho!

55
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,280
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry.

56
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,057
Another five minutes, we was
gonna leave without you.

57
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,955
"We"?

58
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,095
This horse is a fantastic,
beautiful horse, talented horse.

59
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,330
Hard for me to believe.

60
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,199
I seen it myself in Florida.

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,035
You're telling me there was something
wrong with the horse's pussy,

62
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,003
made her quit 300
yards from the finish?

63
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,874
Turning Leaf, her name was, and she
hit the stretch and just quit.

64
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:46,545
Turns out she sucked up
air, you know, vaginally.

65
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,948
A couple gallons of air
get trapped up in there,

66
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,483
and she cramps up,
and she can't run...

67
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,085
very uncommon.

68
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,788
It's like running while you're
trying to take a shit, huh?

69
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,057
It was the humidity.

70
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,293
Horse like that runs up
here, she'd take the field.

71
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,395
Let's go!

72
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,365
I want to know what a white
man's doing walking...

73
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,298
while this nigger is
riding around all day.

74
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,820
Nothing personal, Lucy, huh?

75
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,616
So I grab that fucking
cat by the tail, right?

76
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,285
I hold him upside down,
and that little stewardess

77
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,288
is screaming for me
to leave him alone,

78
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,058
and I says, "I'll leave him
alone, all right," and...

79
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,226
and I take my knife...

80
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,695
Boy, you're about to figure
a way to wipe your ass

81
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,994
with that razor, ain't you?

82
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,852
I ain't said a word all morning.

83
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,284
Which one is it?

84
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,652
It's a green truck.

85
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,588
I got a plate number
right over here.

86
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,023
All these trucks are green.

87
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,658
Yeah, but I got a
number right over here.

88
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,992
It's gonna take a fucking month

89
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,028
just to read the fucking
license plates on that one.

90
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,095
Well, that ain't it.

91
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,155
We're looking for a reefer.

92
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,200
A refrigerated truck, you know,

93
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,537
so the meat don't cook
on its way to Vermont.

94
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,605
Mm-hmm.

95
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,906
It's running.

96
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,508
They don't shut them off.

97
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,209
They're diesels.

98
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,781
Keep them running
for weeks at a time.

99
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,281
That's very interesting...

100
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,250
the history of the
trucking industry.

101
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,085
All right, stay here.
I'm gonna go take a piss.

102
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,929
All right.

103
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,762
Oh.

104
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,065
What's Sal doing here?

105
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,133
Doesn't take three
people to steal a truck.

106
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,369
I owe him a little money.

107
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,941
He just wants to make sure
everything goes down.

108
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,441
Look at him over here.

109
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,343
He's pissing on his shoes.

110
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,377
Yeah.

111
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,546
Why don't you tell him?

112
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,085
He'll shoot you just to show
you he knows what he's doing.

113
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,391
That's it right there.

114
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,538
Hey.

115
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,907
Yeah?

116
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,685
Notice the whole world's got
a fucking attitude lately?

117
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,182
Listen, you go in there, and you have
a nice breakfast, pal, all right?

118
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,517
You take an hour. Understand?

119
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,726
One hour before you come back
out here looking for your truck.

120
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,583
Who's driving?

121
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,260
You all right, pal?

122
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,202
Look, you got your business.
We got ours.

123
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,405
You take the money,
your business is over.

124
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,106
Am I right or wrong?

125
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,207
Huh?

126
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,870
Okay, just take a
couple of deep breaths.

127
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,879
Here's your hat, all right?

128
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,913
Can you get up?

129
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,758
And gonna have a nice
breakfast, just like I said.

130
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,652
Come on.

131
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,954
All of a sudden, the world
ain't got no attitude no more.

132
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,832
What the fuck?

133
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,091
Don't do it.

134
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,739
Shit.

135
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,005
Jesus Christ.

136
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,798
Motherfucker.

137
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,525
You shit yourself, Mickey?

138
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,659
- Oh, yeah.
- Huh?

139
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,094
Fuck you.

140
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,630
I almost cut her tits
off after I, uh,

141
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,233
took care of her fucking kid.

142
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,301
I seen that happen to a girl once.

143
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,503
Huh?

144
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,138
Sliced and diced,
just right fuckin'...

145
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,834
Bullsh-shit.

146
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,478
What the fuck you say?

147
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,653
I heard you talking about me.

148
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,553
I don't give a shit personally,

149
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,889
but I don't like a nigger
talking about my business.

150
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,162
This old nigger's been talking
about me all morning.

151
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,562
Whoa.

152
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,736
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

153
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,059
You hear me now, don't you, fuck?

154
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,911
I didn't mean to cut you, Lucy.

155
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,112
Somebody get Lucy
a Band-Aid. He's...

156
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,559
He's got a cut.

157
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,446
I thought he was...

158
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,900
I love this city...

159
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,736
not the sights, the city.

160
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,506
I love her last night, and
I loved her this morning,

161
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,641
before she brushes her teeth

162
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,941
or I know she snores.

163
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,450
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

164
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,853
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

165
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,656
I've known her warmth
and her coolness.

166
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,492
She's... forgiven me.

167
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,394
I've forgiven her.

168
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,796
I'm used...

169
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,764
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

170
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,245
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

171
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,936
You're right.

172
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,212
I think I fucked her
last night too.

173
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,041
I hope she don't have
no type of herpes.

174
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,408
I'm used to the feel
of her, you know?

175
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,584
I've been writing the story
of this city for 20 years.

176
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,041
What's up with the lights?

177
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,876
Oh, talk to Arthur, Mick.

178
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,323
I keep telling him
he's got to relax.

179
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,381
- I'll do that.
- Do that.

180
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,550
All we can do is have faith
in the electric company.

181
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,252
- Am I right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, yeah.

182
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,721
Sophie says we ain't had
electric for two hours.

183
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,256
It's out in the whole neighborhood.

184
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,291
Yeah.

185
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,892
What are we gonna do with
the load I just brought in?

186
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,228
What the fuck do you think we're
trying to figure out here, Mick?

187
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,630
It's gonna be back
right away. Just relax.

188
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,665
Yeah.

189
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,767
Listen, we got a little business
to talk about, all right?

190
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,258
Right.

191
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,440
I got a problem.

192
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,508
Let me guess.

193
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,510
You don't have my $700.

194
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,844
I'm into Sal for 20 large.

195
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,915
Jesus Christ.

196
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,483
I got so much shit going down,

197
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,118
I don't even know where
it's coming from.

198
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,187
Forget it. I'm doing all right.

199
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,089
When you get it,
you can give it to me.

200
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,123
All right?

201
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,069
Take some of the meat.

202
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,732
Nothing I can do with that.

203
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,767
It's not even cut.

204
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,902
Fuck it.

205
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,930
Let's get this shit in your truck.

206
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,078
I can't use it like this.
There's nowhere to cut it up.

207
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,081
Look, we'll get the electric
back on, you come back tomorrow,

208
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:12,381
we'll get somebody to
cut it up for you.

209
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,589
- Here you go.
- I got it.

210
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,353
- You got it, Mick?
- All right.

211
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:23,599
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

212
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,931
Fuck it all.

213
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,230
It all works out in the end.

214
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,819
All right, what happened here?

215
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,535
It was the lift.

216
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,741
The shackle come loose.

217
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,043
Usually it's tied down
when we're not using it.

218
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,012
The...

219
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,282
chain swung out, and the shackle...

220
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,184
hit the boy right in
the back of the head.

221
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,386
That's what happened.

222
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,155
I seen the whole thing.

223
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,215
Kid never knew what hit him.

224
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,360
Anyone else?

225
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,602
I seen it too.

226
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,465
What was his job?

227
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,195
He was a day laborer.

228
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,805
That it?

229
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,138
That's what happened.

230
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,722
Jeanie?

231
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,352
Jeanie.

232
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,586
Leon's dead.

233
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,198
Richard.

234
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,800
You feeling all right?

235
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,069
Yeah, I had the flu.

236
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,705
Didn't see your column
on page two yesterday.

237
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,708
Opened the paper to see a
goddamn picture of some girl

238
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,974
that had her teeth wired
together to lose weight.

239
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,581
Readers count on you, Richard.

240
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,251
Feeling much better today, okay.

241
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,186
So I looked over the last year.

242
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,489
Did you know you missed 42
days, not counting vacations?

243
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,757
Really?

244
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,858
Mm-hmm.

245
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,128
And I got to thinking about it.

246
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,798
Maybe we ought to bring in
another columnist, you know,

247
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,600
someone to lighten the load.

248
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,902
Found one yet?

249
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,404
Thought I'd give you a
chance to think it over.

250
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,740
Whatever you want, Brookie.

251
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,975
But of course, if it's
a drinking problem...

252
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,277
No.

253
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:28,146
'Cause we have sent people
up to Horizons to dry out.

254
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,614
We could do it for you too.

255
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,815
No.

256
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,307
It's a bug I caught.

257
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,102
Here's my anniversary column.

258
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,891
Yeah.

259
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,191
You have to eat something.

260
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,888
She probably already ate lunch.

261
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,760
He was just a baby.

262
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,037
- Hello.
- Mick, it's Bird.

263
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,939
Hi. You get your electricity back?

264
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,941
Yeah, it came on right
after you left.

265
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,776
This isn't a great time.

266
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,111
Why, what's the matter?

267
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,946
We had an accident with Leon.

268
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,415
What, he got his dick caught
in somebody's cash register?

269
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,484
No, it's a real thing.
Something happened at work.

270
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,086
Some kind of accident. He's dead.

271
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,320
What?

272
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,555
What is it?

273
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,590
Well, they say
something fell on him.

274
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,225
Fell on him? No shit.

275
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,526
Yeah.

276
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,628
Jesus.

277
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,496
I'm sorry to hear that.

278
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,530
Yeah.

279
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,165
Anyway, what I was calling about...

280
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,268
I don't know if it's the appropriate
time, but it's that horse,

281
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,004
the one you was talking
about, Turning Leaf?

282
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,707
She's running in a $15,000
claimer tomorrow at Keystone.

283
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,809
I'm scaring up everything I can.

284
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,779
{figured you'd want to do the same.

285
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,280
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

286
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,349
I'll let Jeanie know.

287
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,085
Uh, just a friend,
heard about the accident.

288
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,829
Uh, I got to take care
of the arrangements.

289
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:25,130
<i>I think I've been there</i>

290
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:30,569
<i>I think I know just what
you're going through</i>

291
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,369
<i>A fallen angel is what you are</i>

292
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,682
You're Richard Shellburn.

293
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,810
Yes, I am.

294
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,753
I thought you'd look older.

295
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,450
Thought you would too.

296
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,933
You go to Temple University?

297
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,431
No.

298
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,299
I graduated.

299
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,333
Journalism.

300
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,235
Oh.

301
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,403
Yeah.

302
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,238
Now I freelance, mostly sports.

303
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,709
Who's Yama Bahama?

304
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,712
<i>A fallen angel is what you are</i>

305
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,988
Is that a name for your penis?

306
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,383
Jesus.

307
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,716
Everyone's got a name
for their penis.

308
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,288
Mickey.

309
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,032
We're real sorry, Mick.

310
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,834
Leon was a good boy.

311
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,136
It don't make no sense to me.

312
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,605
I mean, somebody ought
to do something.

313
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,905
The youth is our
hope for the future.

314
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,449
What happened?

315
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,551
I don't know.

316
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,254
They say something
dropped on him...

317
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,822
down at the job.

318
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,390
Jesus.

319
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,925
That's a shame.

320
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,229
Got to go see Smilin' Jack,
make arrangements.

321
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,266
Jeanie's messed up.

322
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,136
Well, Saturday's a good day
for a funeral, always.

323
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,404
Nobody has to get up the next day.

324
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,572
Mm.

325
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,408
We're collecting for the funeral.

326
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,979
Fuckin' Leon's gonna cost
me more dead than alive.

327
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,882
He was always a nice youngster.

328
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,517
Tell Jeanie that for me.

329
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,718
For Christ's sakes, Eleanor.

330
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,086
You didn't even know him.

331
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,821
That's a damnable lie!

332
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,524
I know all our youngsters!

333
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,492
He was nice back then, Mickey.

334
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,895
He never broke into nobody's
house in the neighborhood...

335
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,463
Eleanor!

336
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,733
Are you gonna sit down,
or I got to pour out your drink?

337
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,901
I mean it today.

338
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,135
I'm cutting you off!

339
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,674
Yeah, well, you can't
cut off the truth!

340
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,881
Fuckin' neighborhood.

341
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,254
Jack.

342
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,745
Mickey.

343
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,195
I'm so sorry to hear about Leon.

344
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,362
Yeah.

345
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,498
You know, sometimes you
wonder about God's plan.

346
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,133
I just want to make
Jeanie feel better.

347
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,045
Let me show you what we got, Mick.

348
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,496
This is our best seller...

349
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,424
mahogany veneer,
champagne interior.

350
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:42,026
What about that one?

351
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,429
Well, of course, you
know Jeanie best,

352
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,967
but she ain't gonna want
some piece of junk.

353
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,802
I got to think it over.

354
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,136
Mick...

355
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,472
we'll work something out.

356
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,709
I just don't want to give her
anything that she ain't gonna like.

357
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,712
Well, how about I stop
over tomorrow morning?

358
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,282
It might be easier for her to talk
about it in familiar surroundings.

359
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,558
I guess so.

360
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,926
Yo, Mick.

361
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,629
Was the body messed up?

362
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,963
No, his body's fine.

363
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,566
It's just the back of his head.

364
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,334
That's no problem at all.

365
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,236
The back of the head
takes care of itself.

366
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,251
Leon didn't take no shit.

367
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:44,564
If I was a father, that's what
I'd want my kid to be like.

368
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,229
You know what I did the
day my mother died?

369
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,565
I went out and I banged
a Locust Street whore.

370
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,934
Remember those girls?

371
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,101
No.

372
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,403
I got home at 1:00 in the morning.

373
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,772
My whole family was
waiting up for me.

374
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,441
It was the Christians and
the lions all over again.

375
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,569
On the day your mother died?

376
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:09,649
I felt bad, but I had
to do something.

377
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,452
What the fuck you doing, man?

378
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,454
Fuck you.

379
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,089
Fuck him!

380
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,924
Hey, what the fuck is
wrong with you guys?

381
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,626
- You're always doing that!
- Play the game.

382
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,061
- Get out of here!
- Sit down!

383
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,829
- Got a problem?
- Get the hell out of here!

384
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,997
Fuck him!

385
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,999
I got to get the fuck out of here.

386
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,059
Your fucking shoe.

387
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,609
You had a lot of
those screwdrivers.

388
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,783
18.

389
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,682
But you drank one.

390
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,288
That's why I can't get it up.

391
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,522
Could you always write?

392
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,225
I mean, did you always
want to be a writer?

393
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,560
What?

394
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:59,292
Do you think sometime I could watch
you write one of your columns?

395
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,172
Sometime.

396
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,861
Oh.

397
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,294
It is the damndest thing.

398
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,865
I can't remember which
one of you is which.

399
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,226
What time is it?

400
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,071
Closing time.

401
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,233
You been drinking?

402
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,401
Yeah.

403
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,737
Tonight you've been out drinking?

404
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,173
And don't go in Jeanie's room.

405
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,442
The doctor had to come twice
to give her medicine,

406
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,477
and he said that she needs
a good night's sleep.

407
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,512
I thought maybe she
might want someone...

408
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,458
Joyce is in there with her.

409
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,487
So you're Joanie.

410
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,022
Aah! Oh, Jesus.

411
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,820
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- What?

412
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,961
Oh, my God.

413
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,462
It's all right. It's all right.

414
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,763
I thought I saw Leon!

415
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,932
Oh, my God!

416
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,969
It's all right.

417
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:25,042
Now, last but perhaps not least,

418
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,478
I feel obliged to show you
the blue-gauge steel.

419
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:32,348
In my opinion, uh, I think...

420
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,310
I think she likes the mahogany.

421
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:44,168
Now, do you have a particular
suit in mind for the service?

422
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,165
Come upstairs.

423
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,705
Voilà.

424
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,212
Jesus Christ.

425
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,420
It's a fucking men's shop.

426
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,620
You know, I never owned
anything you couldn't put

427
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,790
in a fucking drawer
till I met Jeanie.

428
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,693
You suppose all this shit is hot?

429
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,538
You learn in my business
not to question.

430
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,835
So the 6 grand, can I put
it on layaway or what?

431
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,306
You want me to tell Jeanie
you want something cheaper?

432
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,340
Hey, I'm just...

433
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,548
This should be all I need.

434
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,382
Something happened to
Leon over at that job,

435
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,489
something nobody's told us yet.

436
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,623
Anybody tell you anything
you didn't tell me?

437
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:50,828
All they told me was that something
dropped and hit him on the skull.

438
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,830
That's the whole thing.

439
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,333
Something else happened.

440
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,177
It did.

441
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,846
Okay.

442
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,874
I'll see what I can find out.

443
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,638
Okay?

444
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,552
Hey, Mick.

445
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,583
The power's back on.

446
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,151
Let's get that meat cut for you.

447
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,319
Listen, Bird...

448
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,221
I appreciate you taking
it instead of the cash.

449
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,856
We'll get all this shit
straightened out.

450
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,890
Don't you worry.

451
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,692
Hey.

452
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,571
Look it, queers, huh?

453
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,931
Remember in school when
they said you was queer

454
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,399
if you wore yellow on Tuesday?

455
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,096
That's the stupidest fucking
thing I heard all day.

456
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,671
I forgot you ain't from here.

457
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,573
You missed a lot of
great shit, Mick.

458
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,475
Hey, Tony! Come here.

459
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,976
This is my nephew.

460
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,078
Say hello to Bird's main man.

461
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,147
Hmm? He don't talk much.

462
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,449
But this little fucker
can cut meat.

463
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,019
Take the meat out of Mickey's truck
and cut it up for him, all right?

464
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,716
Do a nice job. Don't
sneeze on it or nothing.

465
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,991
Listen, Mick. I made up my mind.

466
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,688
That horse, Turning Leaf?

467
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,796
She's gonna come in tomorrow.

468
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,997
Nice horse.

469
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,332
She's running with a
bunch of shit too.

470
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,733
She's a lock.

471
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,703
Bird, there's nothing weighs half a ton
with little bitty ankles that's a lock.

472
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,071
Hey, I'm trying to
help you out here,

473
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:08,539
but if you don't want
to listen, it's on you.

474
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,541
You want to help me?
I need that $700.

475
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,043
Hey, all I got is this horse.

476
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,478
Smilin' Jack ain't exactly
giving away funerals.

477
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,813
Jesus, the funeral.

478
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,149
I-I forgot.

479
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,583
How's Jeanie doing?

480
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,754
She's got some idea that something
else happened down there to Leon.

481
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,558
I don't know where the fuck
it came from, but there it is.

482
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,393
Yeah, fucking Leon.

483
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,428
Yeah.

484
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,198
Actually, I was hoping you...
you'd ask around for me.

485
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,232
Yeah.

486
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,360
You mean you want
me to talk to Sal?

487
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:44,308
I-I hate to ask, but Jeanie
ain't gonna let go on this one.

488
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,145
I'll do it for you.

489
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,146
You got my word.

490
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,481
- All right.
- Oh.

491
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,983
- What the fuck?
- Come on.

492
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,219
We ought to sue these
motherfuckers.

493
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,888
"A 22-year-old construction
worker was killed yesterday

494
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,623
when he slipped and
fell to his death."

495
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,125
Leon Hubbard didn't
slip on nothing.

496
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,527
They're laying block down there.
Where was there to fall?

497
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,796
Jeez, you look worse than I do.

498
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,431
Everybody in the fucking
city's gonna think

499
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,799
we're a bunch of
jerk-offs down here,

500
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,530
walking around falling
off shit all the time.

501
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,805
I'm gonna call these motherfuckers.

502
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,073
And they fucked up his age.

503
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,406
He was a year ahead
of me in school.

504
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,986
1,440 bucks.

505
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,890
Yeah?

506
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,193
Let me have the bag back sometime.

507
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,037
Yeah.

508
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,710
Thank you.

509
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:50,875
Cheers.

510
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,076
Cheers.

511
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,567
Thank you.

512
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,258
Richard.

513
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,759
Huh?

514
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,629
Brookie here. You feeling better?

515
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,664
Well...

516
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,767
I'm lying here with a...

517
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,203
jaybird-naked-ass girl graduate

518
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:22,106
of the Temple University
School of Journalism.

519
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,008
I'm glad to hear it. How was she?

520
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,211
Well, if you get off the phone,
I'll try and find out for you.

521
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:30,414
Did you notice that you weren't
in the paper again this morning?

522
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,615
Why?

523
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,051
I gave you my anniversary
column yesterday.

524
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,521
And I enjoyed it, just like I did
last year and the year before that.

525
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,491
You've written the same anniversary
column four different times.

526
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:43,294
I could write the same column
every day and get away with it.

527
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,963
I need a favor.

528
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,633
We ran a story about a kid got
killed on a construction job,

529
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,302
and somehow we fucked it all up.

530
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,903
Is this really important, Brookie?

531
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,939
I mean, she got my
dick in her mouth.

532
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,640
So I'm thinking, "Why don't I ask

533
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,242
"Richard Shellburn to go down there

534
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,911
"and write me a column about
that boy and get it done right?"

535
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,081
- Bibles, pictures...
- I really... I can't talk now.

536
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,417
I'm eating pussy.

537
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:10,559
1821 25th street, God's Pocket.

538
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,596
Thank you for listening.

539
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,164
I'll get you some more coffee.

540
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,962
It's my pleasure.

541
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,473
This is my husband.

542
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,582
We'll be in touch.

543
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,417
Sorry for your loss.

544
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,653
We're still investigating
the accident.

545
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,488
We'll get back to you
when we're finished.

546
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,582
Thank you, Officer.

547
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,469
So what did they say?

548
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,770
They were nice.

549
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,399
They said they'd go back to
the yard and talk to the men.

550
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,379
Something happened.

551
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,473
How do you know that, Jeanie?

552
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,723
I don't know, but I know.

553
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,064
Sal. How you doing?

554
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,532
You got my money?

555
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,167
Hey, the electric went out.

556
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:33,003
As soon as I get the meat cut,
get it out, everybody gets paid.

557
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,273
All right, don't
fuck around, Arthur.

558
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,775
Sal.

559
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,277
Hey, I got a...

560
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,724
a favor to ask.

561
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,153
This kid got killed at
the block yard downtown.

562
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,955
His mother's going crazy.

563
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,990
They ain't telling
her what happened.

564
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,526
What's this to me?

565
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,294
The mother's married to a
guy who works for me...

566
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,696
Mickey, the guy who took the truck?

567
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,763
Yeah.

568
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,966
Maybe you could send a
couple of guys down there,

569
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,501
bounce somebody around
so they talk to you.

570
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,070
Nothing's gonna happen down there?

571
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,338
Nah.

572
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,739
Just a couple guys to push around?

573
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,310
That's it.

574
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,910
All right.

575
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,712
For a point on top of
what you already owe.

576
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,747
Fine.

577
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:18,591
Whatever you want.

578
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,518
And, Arthur, don't fuck around.

579
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,720
Okay.

580
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:25,489
Hey. Make sure you get my money.

581
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,958
You'll get it. You'll get it.

582
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,802
You'll get it.

583
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,133
It was an accident.

584
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,935
That's...

585
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,837
all there is to it.

586
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,108
Kid was the wrong person
at the wrong place.

587
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,738
Cops get the... n-nigger?

588
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,147
You ain't grown enough

589
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,447
to call that old man a nigger.

590
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:01,158
Old Lucy will be back
when he's ready.

591
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,252
All right, let's go.

592
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,915
I'll have a beer.

593
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,866
<i>She don't even care about me</i>

594
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,172
Is that Leon Hubbard's
house across the street?

595
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,575
You're aren't Richard
Shellburn, are you?

596
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,343
Mm-hmm.

597
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,179
I-I read you every day.

598
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,916
Yeah, you're different from your
picture, but I knew it was you.

599
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,918
It's me.

600
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,720
So is that the Hubbard place?

601
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,189
- Scarpato.
- Oh.

602
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,191
The mother remarried.
Jeanie Scarpato.

603
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,027
How's she taking it?

604
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,897
Well, it was her only child.

605
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:50,834
Mr. Shellburn, you're the only
one that knows what it's like

606
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,536
down here in the Pocket.

607
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,529
God bless you.

608
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,115
Another?

609
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,183
Thank you.

610
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,351
It's the mother.

611
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,620
The mother thinks
something happened.

612
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,112
What does she think?

613
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,896
You missing somebody today
besides Leon Hubbard?

614
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,297
Seems like there was an old man.

615
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,666
He was sitting against the wall.

616
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,902
That's Old Lucy.

617
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,237
Some days, he comes in,
and some days, he don't.

618
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,439
He does as much work either way.

619
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,567
He's about 100 years old.

620
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:34,812
Look.

621
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,147
That mother, she's got something.

622
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,582
She could look at you a certain way

623
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,717
and you'd stick a fork in your leg.

624
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,087
They say that her
husband is connected.

625
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:47,057
If that's true, that might be
where your problem comes from.

626
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,761
Either way, she's got
his balls in a blender.

627
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,229
You can see that.

628
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,998
And there ain't no telling
what anybody will do

629
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,166
with his balls in a blender.

630
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,442
Fuckin' write it down or something.

631
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,414
Hi.

632
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,950
All right.

633
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,365
Same race it was last night, Bird.

634
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,602
I don't like this other
filly, the 6 horse.

635
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,670
She scares me.

636
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,439
She got a decent workout last week.

637
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,506
So?

638
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,276
- Put her at the bottom of an exacta.
- I don't like her.

639
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,745
This horse can beat Turning
Leaf, the 6 horse.

640
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,080
Your nerves are eating
your brain, Bird.

641
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,782
- I am telling you, Mick...
- Bird, if Turning Leaf runs at all,

642
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:49,779
there's nothing in that fucking dog
kennel that's gonna catch her.

643
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,023
How much you got there?

644
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,591
Whatever I could
get my hands on it.

645
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,894
I borrowed some of
Sophie's flower money.

646
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,228
Feel terrible.

647
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,497
Turning Leaf, eight-to-one.

648
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,000
You'll feel better once
you place your bet.

649
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,668
I'm telling you, Mick.

650
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:05,769
It's the 6 horse.

651
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,739
Jesus, Bird.

652
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,340
I'll be right back. Stay here.

653
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,707
Don't do anything fucking crazy.

654
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:21,351
Number 3 horse,
Turning Leaf, to win.

655
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,411
45 times.

656
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:38,906
Hey.

657
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,576
You the boss?

658
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,778
I'm the only one here.

659
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,913
That's a fact.

660
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,215
The thing is, somebody got
killed here yesterday,

661
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,752
and there's some feeling it didn't
happen the way the cops said.

662
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:59,356
So we were wondering if, uh, maybe
you were here when it happened.

663
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:02,859
'Cause the guy who got it,
he was an important guy.

664
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,657
Huh.

665
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,256
He always said he was important.

666
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,763
So how do you want to do this?

667
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,077
It happened the way
I said to the police.

668
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:23,914
And you Jew boys can do
it any damn way you want.

669
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,615
It don't matter to me.

670
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,984
"Jew boys."

671
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,652
Now, why you want to do that?

672
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,287
Did we insult you in any way?

673
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,356
Huh?

674
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,724
Come on.

675
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,425
Let's go somewhere we can talk.

676
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,927
Hit him, Ronnie.

677
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,896
Fucking hit him!

678
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,973
Oh, God!

679
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,551
You didn't bet the
6 horse, did you?

680
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,053
Well...

681
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:06,194
You're fucking crazy.

682
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:12,195
And they're off at Keystone,
$15,000 claiming race.

683
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,565
The number 4 horse, One Hit
Wonder, takes an early lead.

684
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,667
My Oh Might tucked in at the rail

685
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,570
and Shana Three coming
up between the horses.

686
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,273
No Man's Land moves
up on the outside.

687
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,476
One Hit Wonder, Shana
Three, No Man's Land.

688
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,211
My Oh Might makes a
move on the inside.

689
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,049
One Hit Wonder, Shana Three,
and into third, Turning Leaf.

690
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,384
Turning Leaf stiff moving
up to the second spot.

691
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:38,688
One Hit Wonder, Turning
Leaf, Shana Three.

692
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,323
We're into the far turn,

693
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,026
and it's One Hit Wonder
showing the lead by a length

694
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,194
with Turning Leaf...

695
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:45,362
Come on, you motherfucker.

696
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:48,098
One Hit Wonder, Turning Leaf.

697
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,866
And it's Turning Leaf pulling in.

698
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,668
- Come on!
- Yes!

699
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,338
And at the top of the lane, it's
Turning Leaf moving into first.

700
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,974
Turning Leaf-One, Hit Wonder
holding on to second.

701
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,143
Please.

702
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:03,013
And passing the number 5 horse
is Holmesdale, the number 6.

703
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:06,416
Turning Leaf, One Hit
Wonder, and Holmesdale

704
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,510
racing up on the outside.

705
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,023
Turning Leaf,
Holmesdale on the outside.

706
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:14,257
It's the 6.

707
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,659
Turning Leaf, Holmesdale...

708
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,894
they fight it out,
and it's Holmesdale.

709
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,386
- Ohh!
- No.

710
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,206
I-I tried to tell you, Mick.

711
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,050
It was the 6.

712
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,339
Mm.

713
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,310
Hello?

714
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,220
Can I help you?

715
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:15,252
Uh, I'm looking for Mrs. Scarpato.

716
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:17,154
Yes.

717
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,723
You're Mrs. Scarpato?

718
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,291
Yes.

719
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:22,592
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,927
I'm sorry.

721
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:25,762
I'm sorry.

722
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,831
Uh...

723
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,867
I'm Richard Shellburn
of The Daily Times.

724
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,035
Oh, my.

725
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,527
Uh, please come in.

726
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,418
This one makes his ears
look bigger than they were.

727
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,082
Oh.

728
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,587
I'm so sorry for your loss.

729
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:56,693
It didn't happen like
they said it happened.

730
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,095
There's something wrong with it.

731
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:02,907
I knew Leon, and he was my boy.

732
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,219
I know.

733
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,356
Mr. Shellburn?

734
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:44,881
So, um, what...
what kind of boy was he?

735
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,647
Hey.

736
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:53,883
What was that job, uh,
yesterday... 700?

737
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,819
It's old business. I took the meat.

738
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,886
Fuck that.

739
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:57,988
Here.

740
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,656
I took the meat. Keep your money.

741
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:00,824
Take 7.

742
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,659
- Take 10, for the interest.
- Bird.

743
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,327
Look, I got maybe 12 grand here.

744
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,862
I owe Sal 20.

745
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:09,162
But if I give him 10, maybe
he'll lay off for a while.

746
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,938
7?

747
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,509
All right.

748
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,912
Thinking of taking
Sophie to Florida.

749
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,914
She wants to live in one
of those trailer parks

750
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:28,544
with her friends, grow
some shit in the yard.

751
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,049
Jack.

752
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,797
Jesus, God. You scared
the piss out of me.

753
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,800
Oh, shit.

754
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,879
You think people are gonna
smell this shit on her?

755
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,373
Irish funeral.

756
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,548
Listen, uh, I got a
problem with the money.

757
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:56,646
Oh, that's too bad.

758
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,983
Yeah, it's nothing permanent,
but if we have the service,

759
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,718
I could pay you back
in a couple weeks,

760
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:05,455
and if I can't get it back to
you then, I'll sell the truck.

761
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:07,457
How much money you got?

762
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,992
700.

763
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,994
What about the fucking
money from The Hollywood?

764
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,295
There was more than 700 there.

765
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,297
Things happen.
I'll get you the money.

766
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,633
I just... I-I got to
have the funeral,

767
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,875
and Jeanie's fucked
up over all this.

768
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,470
That's nothing to me.

769
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:23,039
It's your fuckin' woman and your
fuckin' body unless I get paid.

770
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,174
Don't get hysterical.

771
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,642
I don't need my
business on the street.

772
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,077
You ain't got no fucking business.

773
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:29,779
What you got is
something on the side.

774
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,880
No.

775
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,515
No, you bet a game, right?

776
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,084
You bet a fucking game.

777
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,086
What I did has nothing
to do with you,

778
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:37,587
and what you got to worry about

779
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,156
is making sure that everything's
all right Saturday,

780
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,093
and then you get your money.

781
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:45,028
Sure, Mick.

782
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,130
Sure.

783
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:48,798
Yeah.

784
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,467
Don't look at me like that, Jack.

785
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:51,634
W-what?

786
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,236
What are you talking about...
look at you?

787
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,273
- Don't look at me like that.
- What?

788
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,109
Oh.

789
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,177
Motherfucker!

790
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,908
No need to panic.

791
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:08,218
I'll pay you back in a couple
weeks, a month on the outside.

792
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,278
You understand?

793
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,422
I'm sorry, Mick.

794
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,459
I don't know what's wrong with me.

795
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,196
Let me... let me go get us a beer.

796
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:31,641
Leon always loved animals,
ever since he was a little boy.

797
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:35,237
He always wanted a dog
or a cat or something.

798
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,192
I used to think it would be nice to
live out in the country and have a few.

799
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,976
Think that country air would...

800
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,028
Mr. Shellburn?

801
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:55,298
I have a place by the water.

802
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:59,614
I've had it for a very long
time, and nobody knows.

803
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:21,057
I go there sometimes at
night, I drink too much,

804
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,026
and I wake up with the birds,

805
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:26,053
and things are growing
everywhere you look.

806
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,762
Do you need to know
anything else about Leon?

807
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,805
Yo, Mick.

808
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:10,874
I don't know what got
into me. I was wrong.

809
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,809
I need this done right.

810
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,244
We'll take care of it.

811
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,736
You and me got no arguments, Mick.

812
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,883
I hope you don't mind
going out the side.

813
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:21,050
I'm locked up in front.

814
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,541
I don't mind nothing.

815
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,893
I got to get this light fixed.

816
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,227
It's getting cold.

817
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,071
Yeah, it's a cold world.

818
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,709
What the fuck?

819
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:08,534
Holy shit.

820
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,932
Oh, Jesus, Leon.

821
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:26,285
I need to know what
happened to my boy, please.

822
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,479
Oh, um...

823
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,114
can I call you tomorrow?

824
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:33,783
Yes, please.

825
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:35,118
Thank you, Mr. Shellburn.

826
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,178
Okay.

827
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,164
Jeanie?

828
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:47,839
I'm up here with Richard Shellburn.

829
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,497
He wanted to see Leon's room.

830
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,747
Richard Shellburn,
this is my husband.

831
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:08,161
Oh, um, yeah,
I'm sorry for your loss.

832
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:15,692
Um, you know, I think that's, uh...

833
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:19,162
I think it's all I need,
uh, for now.

834
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:21,531
Anything, please. If you
need anything, call me.

835
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,598
Okay.

836
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,100
It's all I have to do.

837
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,137
All right.

838
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:37,504
Jeanie, there's something
I need to tell you.

839
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,789
Jeanie.

840
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,203
Jeanie.

841
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,587
Everything set for tomorrow?

842
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,920
All set.

843
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,889
Just a few last-minute details.

844
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:06,736
Where's Arthur?

845
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:09,372
Who?

846
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:10,573
Where is he?

847
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:13,709
This is the way you do business...
scaring an old woman?

848
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,512
Oh, now... now you're
gonna steal from me?

849
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:17,613
He's in the back.

850
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:18,714
Want me go around back?

851
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,249
Yeah, he can't run,
but what the fuck?

852
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,617
Well, he's... he's got the money.

853
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,085
He told me.

854
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,921
This ain't about the money.

855
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,589
You see my cousin out there?

856
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,424
Yesterday he had two eyes.

857
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:31,427
Now he's gonna have a piece of glass in
his fucking head the rest of his life.

858
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,162
Without Arthur, what's
gonna happen to me?

859
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,269
If I were you, I'd shut my mouth.

860
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:40,970
Run for your life, Arthur!

861
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:43,773
What the fuck?

862
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:46,470
Oh!

863
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,813
Sophie!

864
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,748
What are you doing, Sophie?

865
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,546
One second.

866
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,557
Oh.

867
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:02,925
This is my family, you hear me?

868
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,861
- You little fuck!
- No, no, no, no!

869
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,295
I'll fucking kill you, you fuck!

870
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,396
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur!

871
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,131
- I'll kill you!
- Stop. Stop.

872
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,800
- Arthur, you're getting...
- Yeah!

873
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,336
You're getting blood all over
your pants. Just go change.

874
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,504
- The cops will be here.
- I swear to Christ, Sophie,

875
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,973
I didn't know nothing like
this was gonna happen.

876
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,040
Go change your pants.

877
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:22,778
You don't want people taking pictures
of you looking like this. Right?

878
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,614
- Fuck.
- Arthur.

879
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:25,982
That fuck.

880
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:29,245
Arthur, this is not the time
to go wacko... not now.

881
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:50,973
Yeah, Operator?

882
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:56,011
I want to, uh, report that two
men tried to rob my flower shop.

883
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:08,129
Mickey left early.

884
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:11,663
He seemed different.

885
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,565
Hello.

886
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,295
This is Richard Shellburn.

887
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:21,681
Richard Shellburn.

888
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,510
Mr. Shellburn?

889
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:30,613
Uh, we need to talk.

890
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,748
Did you find something out?

891
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,592
I'D' pick you up.

892
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,522
Where are we going?

893
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:42,024
We're almost there.

894
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,902
Almost.

895
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:49,732
It all looks the same, doesn't it?

896
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:53,135
If you woke up here alone,
you'd never get back.

897
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,627
Never want to.

898
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,338
Hey, Nick.

899
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,373
Got a minute?

900
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:31,841
I'm here.

901
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,009
I got some meat.

902
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,377
Thought maybe you could use some.

903
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:35,411
No.

904
00:58:35,412 --> 00:58:36,579
Well, how much you got?

905
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,681
Four sides, Kansas choice beef.

906
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:39,849
No.

907
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,250
How much you want?

908
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,486
$1,000. I don't got time
to fuck around with this.

909
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:44,820
You got it with you?

910
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,822
Yeah, let me take you
down a side to look at.

911
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,859
I could look at it in the truck.

912
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,494
I got some other shit in there.

913
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:53,829
I don't care what you
got in your truck.

914
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,165
I don't see nothing but meat
when I'm looking at meat.

915
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,867
Let me pull you down a side.

916
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,568
Eh, fuck it. I don't
think I want in on this.

917
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,337
- All right, take a look.
- For Christ's sakes.

918
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:02,705
- I don't see nothing...
- It's good beef.

919
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,273
I don't see nothing but
what I'm looking at.

920
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,117
Anything else is your own business.

921
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:09,745
Oh.

922
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,280
This looks good, man.

923
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,215
- What are you doing?
- Let me take a look at it.

924
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,854
You don't got to go up there.

925
00:59:23,794 --> 00:59:25,461
I'm just doing some guy
a favor, all right?

926
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,828
Don't pay any attention
to that. It's nothing.

927
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,570
It's cold.

928
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,905
It's a refrigerated truck.

929
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,106
What do you say, Nick?

930
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:38,908
You gonna take it off
my hands or what?

931
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,510
It's a cheap suit.
What happened to him?

932
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,001
He died.

933
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,682
I-I-I'm doing some guy a favor.

934
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,584
I don't like this.

935
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,486
You put me in a bad position.

936
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,321
Because of you,
I'm an accessory now.

937
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,390
You ain't nothing because
you ain't seen nothing.

938
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,058
I ain't taking that kind of meat.

939
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,960
Who knows what kind of
sickness it could have got

940
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,395
riding back here with a human body?

941
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:00,763
You're the one that wanted
to fucking look at it.

942
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,098
I didn't want to see that.

943
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,732
As a matter of fact,
I didn't see it.

944
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,068
I don't know nothing about it,
and you didn't come by today.

945
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,236
Take the fucking meat.

946
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,728
I ain't... get the
fuck out of here.

947
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,652
I thought when you told
me about this place,

948
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,348
you might have made it up.

949
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,392
I bought this for my wife
without telling her.

950
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:35,124
That's before she realized
that she hated me.

951
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,501
Okay.

952
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:40,669
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

953
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,572
All right.

954
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:46,349
This is where the living
room was supposed to be.

955
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,076
It's a good view.

956
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,580
Shit.

957
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,638
Ah.

958
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,382
I'm 60 years old.

959
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,916
You don't look that old.

960
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,151
Well...

961
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:39,747
I'm 60 years old, and a
whole city loves me.

962
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:43,492
I get letters every
day from people...

963
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:47,396
asking me to come to dinner,

964
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,999
visit them in the Poconos.

965
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,662
Do you go?

966
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,904
No.

967
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,510
Golf... they want me to play golf.

968
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,644
It's pretty.

969
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:11,178
It's actually beautiful.

970
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,256
Tell me,

971
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,059
how long would it take you

972
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:21,224
to get tired of having
a celebrity around?

973
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:25,400
Mickey!

974
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,304
What, you come here to finally
sell me that truck, huh?

975
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,572
Yeah, yeah. I need
to get rid of it.

976
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:31,874
Oh.

977
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,309
What's... what's wrong with it?

978
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,643
Ah, nothing.

979
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,079
Temporary financial problem.

980
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,380
Okay, well, what did you...

981
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:40,258
what did you pay for that thing?

982
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:49,236
Oh, my God, Mickey, they
saw you coming, huh?

983
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,828
And there's nothing wrong with it?

984
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,396
60,000 miles on it.

985
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:57,266
I check the oil, keep
it in the garage.

986
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:58,801
Now, you can start it up,

987
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:03,005
but I don't want
nobody taking it out.

988
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,107
I got some stuff in the back.

989
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:07,142
I don't see nothing but what
I'm looking at, Mickey.

990
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,444
You heard me.

991
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:09,935
All right.

992
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,527
Stretch! Stretch!

993
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:22,324
It's hard to believe only two
days ago, Leon was alive.

994
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:25,829
Nothing works against
you like time.

995
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,627
Time's a bitch.

996
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,367
Oh.

997
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,852
So you said you found
something out about Leon?

998
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:58,660
My husband's gonna
wonder where I am.

999
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,496
Let me tell you about your husband.

1000
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:04,466
He can put an air conditioner
into a wall all by himself

1001
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,435
or lift an engine block,

1002
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:09,338
but he sits in that bar for
two hours every night,

1003
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:13,420
and then he comes home,
and he doesn't say jack shit.

1004
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:21,952
He doesn't have the faintest
idea what to do with you.

1005
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:40,536
How long you had that thing?

1006
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:42,937
About a year and a half.

1007
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,775
Well, you know, if everything
works out, Mickey,

1008
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,845
you know, I could probably
get you, like, 5 1/2, 6.

1009
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:51,046
Yeah.

1010
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,482
Yeah, because business sucks
in the summer, Mickey.

1011
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:55,517
Everyone's thinking about pussy.

1012
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:56,518
Hmm.

1013
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,953
What the fuck?

1014
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,122
He's just gonna make sure
that everything checks out.

1015
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,623
What the fuck?

1016
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,759
He'll be right back.
He's gonna be back in a sec...

1017
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,893
Mickey.

1018
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:08,564
Mickey, I can't buy no truck without
taking it out for a drive first.

1019
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:10,863
You know that.

1020
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:15,516
I really should be getting back.

1021
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:42,637
I'm not mad. I'm just running!

1022
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,827
Wait a minute!

1023
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,074
Stop!

1024
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:53,918
Stop!

1025
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,164
This is my motherfucking meat.

1026
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:51,895
Take it easy, lady.

1027
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,975
Where the fuck did he think he
was going in a suit like that?

1028
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,775
Anyone see the vehicle
hit the victim?

1029
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,778
Jesus Christ.

1030
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,636
I love you.

1031
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:06,280
The moment that I laid eyes on
you, I was in love with you.

1032
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,921
Where... where's your truck?

1033
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,823
It's wrecked.

1034
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,091
Stretch?

1035
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,458
I don't know... hospital, I guess.

1036
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:27,963
You got insurance, Mick?

1037
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,565
I told you you could start it
but not to take it anywhere.

1038
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,768
I got to try it before I buy it.

1039
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:34,302
You told me 6.

1040
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,837
Oh, Mickey, I...

1041
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,739
You know, I can't buy
something that's wrecked.

1042
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,007
I would love to help
you out, but I...

1043
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,885
You bought it already.

1044
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,608
You know, technically, Mick...

1045
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:53,694
That's for the mahogany box, the
funeral, and everything else, right?

1046
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,792
Where's the deceased?

1047
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:59,327
He's down at the morgue.
There was another accident.

1048
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,395
When it rains, it pours.

1049
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:03,098
Yeah, well, they got him down there.
They probably don't know who he is.

1050
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:06,435
- He wasn't carrying no identification.
- What the hell happened to you?

1051
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:10,205
Can we take care of this tomorrow?
I want it done tomorrow.

1052
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,868
Let me call down the
morgue and find out.

1053
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,872
You know, this never
come up before.

1054
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,018
Jeanie.

1055
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,059
Jeanie.

1056
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:37,899
Hello.

1057
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,034
Hey, Mick. It's Bird.

1058
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:40,702
Yeah.

1059
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,304
You heard, right?

1060
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:43,305
What?

1061
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:44,840
You should have seen it.

1062
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:47,609
I didn't even know Sophie kept
that fucking thing loaded.

1063
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,277
What, Sal?

1064
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:50,479
Yeah.

1065
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,316
Sophie and I are gonna
get out of here tonight.

1066
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:56,918
I'll let you know where we end up.

1067
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,648
Good luck, Mick.

1068
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:14,169
What the hell happened to you?

1069
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,805
The funeral's tomorrow at 3:00.

1070
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,940
If you wouldn't mind
letting people know?

1071
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,308
That's good.

1072
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,310
Saturday is a good
day for a funeral.

1073
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:24,802
Small service at Jack's.

1074
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,992
Shame about the kid.

1075
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:39,484
The whole neighborhood was sorry.

1076
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,063
But they didn't live with him.

1077
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,865
They don't know what
it's really like.

1078
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,200
That's the truth.

1079
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:47,536
And they didn't live with Jeanie.

1080
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:49,971
They can say this or that.

1081
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,099
It's all just talk.

1082
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,285
What is?

1083
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,580
Don't listen to them.

1084
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:02,392
Nobody in here went any
further than the 10th grade.

1085
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,587
What's just talk?

1086
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:08,723
She was just riding in his car.

1087
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,125
It doesn't mean anything.

1088
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:12,127
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1089
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:15,831
The big thing is, you can
leave all of this behind.

1090
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,766
That's the beauty part.

1091
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:19,234
Remember that.

1092
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:21,236
You want to know why I
never got out of here?

1093
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:24,536
What I want to know is
what everybody's saying.

1094
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,580
Ray.

1095
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:32,581
It's nothing.

1096
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:34,583
I'm telling you.

1097
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:36,529
Ray.

1098
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,200
That Jeanie's been fucking
Richard Shellburn.

1099
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,195
It's not what I think.

1100
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,364
It's what they're saying.

1101
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,867
<i>Come down off your throne</i>

1102
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,602
<i>And leave your body alone</i>

1103
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:55,570
She ain't fucking nobody.

1104
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,339
<i>Somebody</i>

1105
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:01,076
<i>Must change</i>

1106
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:02,577
She ain't.

1107
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:06,681
<i>I've been waiting so long</i>

1108
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:10,752
<i>Somebody holds the key</i>

1109
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:13,688
<i>Well, I'm near the end</i>

1110
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:16,992
<i>And I just ain't got the time</i>

1111
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:19,027
She's got... she's got some idea

1112
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:22,530
that Leon died differently
than the cops said, is all.

1113
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,632
He's helping her.

1114
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:25,133
What the fuck you
starting now, Ray?

1115
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,201
We're just talking.

1116
01:13:26,202 --> 01:13:29,004
Fuckin' funeral's tomorrow, and
you're talking shit like that?

1117
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:31,306
I didn't say anything everybody
else in here didn't say first.

1118
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:34,242
Don't believe anything
this guy says.

1119
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,811
Fuckin' people!

1120
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:39,713
Talk about everything!

1121
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,884
Last call!

1122
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:48,723
It's not even time!

1123
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,625
Right. Drink up.

1124
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,594
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

1125
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,462
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1126
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,564
<i>But I can't find</i>

1127
01:13:56,565 --> 01:14:00,135
<i>My way home</i>

1128
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:05,173
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1129
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:10,879
<i>But I can't find my way home</i>

1130
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,884
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1131
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:21,222
<i>But I can't find my way home</i>

1132
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,857
<i>Still I can't find</i>

1133
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:26,561
<i>My way home</i>

1134
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:29,631
<i>And I ain't done nothing</i>

1135
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,967
<i>Wrong</i>

1136
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,034
<i>But I</i>

1137
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:40,635
<i>Can't find my way home</i>

1138
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,022
It's in the paper!

1139
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:55,390
What?

1140
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:57,993
That Leon was killed again.

1141
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,494
What? Why would they say that?

1142
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,964
Because they found his
body in the street!

1143
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:06,412
Why did they find his body
in the street, Mickey?

1144
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:10,772
I didn't have the money
to pay to bury Leon,

1145
01:15:10,773 --> 01:15:12,941
so I took the truck
to Little Eddie's,

1146
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:16,845
but his guy took it out and
wrecked it, and Leon fell out.

1147
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,547
What?

1148
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:21,755
What?

1149
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:26,018
Leon was in the truck.

1150
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:29,018
No.

1151
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,527
With the meat?

1152
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,696
He was separated from the meat.

1153
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,665
I knew that would upset you.

1154
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,401
Where is he now?

1155
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,736
He's at Jack's.

1156
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:44,039
And it's all settled.

1157
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,007
He was just a baby!

1158
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:48,676
And it's in the paper.

1159
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,678
I'm sorry, Jeanie.

1160
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:54,160
But it's... it's nothing
to be ashamed of...

1161
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:58,453
you know, people
having money problems.

1162
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:00,945
I have to live in
this neighborhood!

1163
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,715
And everybody's gonna know.

1164
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,899
Everybody already knows...

1165
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,391
everything.

1166
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:21,399
Until recently, you only had
to die once in this city...

1167
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,907
even if you came from God's Pocket.

1168
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:31,753
There was a time when a 23-year-old
working man could die once,

1169
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:36,424
have the event noticed
in his local newspaper,

1170
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,760
and then move on to his reward

1171
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,596
without the complications
of an additional death.

1172
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,264
Give us this day our daily bread...

1173
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,934
Leon Hubbard's death was
reported incorrectly

1174
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:49,270
by this newspaper last week.

1175
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,445
But, then, Leon Hubbard
wasn't important.

1176
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:56,413
Mickey. Oh, motherfucker!

1177
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,550
Leon Hubbard was like the other
working people of God's Pocket...

1178
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:07,355
dirty-faced, uneducated,
neat as a pin inside.

1179
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,358
Motherfucker!

1180
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:18,032
They Work, marry, and have
children who inhabit the Pocket,

1181
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:21,514
often in the homes of their
mothers and fathers.

1182
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:29,144
They drink at The Hollywood
or the Uptown Bar...

1183
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,646
little places deep in the city,

1184
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,983
and they argue there about
things they don't understand...

1185
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,795
politics, race, religion.

1186
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:44,930
And in the end, they die
like everyone else...

1187
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,030
Leaving their families
and their houses

1188
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:52,057
and their legends.

1189
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,932
And there is a dignity in that.

1190
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,913
We owe Leon Hubbard an apology

1191
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:08,783
and all the people who knew him
and loved him and worked with him.

1192
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:11,586
If we stop listening to
Leon Hubbard's story

1193
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:14,355
and all the neighborhood
stories like it,

1194
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:17,837
eventually the neighborhoods
will stop listening to ours.

1195
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,484
<i>Packed my bags, I'm ready</i>

1196
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:46,454
Give me a beer.

1197
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,056
<i>To go down to the city</i>

1198
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,691
Mr. Shellburn, nothing personal,

1199
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:51,993
but I think that I better
ask you to leave...

1200
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:54,996
for your own good.

1201
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:57,329
Give me a beer.

1202
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:03,538
What the fuck are you writing
about us in the papers for?

1203
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:05,340
How is it your business what we do?

1204
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,582
Calling us ignorant, dirty-faced.

1205
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,478
That was a compliment.

1206
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,480
You work for a living.
You get dirty.

1207
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:14,315
That's dirty hands.

1208
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:16,651
Dirty-faced, you don't take a bath.

1209
01:19:16,652 --> 01:19:17,986
I mean, you ain't from around here,

1210
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:19,587
and you're making us
look like assholes.

1211
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:20,855
You don't fucking know us.

1212
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,024
No, I don't... I didn't
make you assholes.

1213
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:24,392
I said the opposite.

1214
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:26,394
If he wasn't busy
fucking Leon's mother,

1215
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:29,063
he might have noticed everybody
in here ain't dirty.

1216
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,298
No offense, Mickey.

1217
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:31,566
All right, maybe we all
ought to calm down.

1218
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:33,768
Fuck calm down. What
is he doing down here?

1219
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,237
I'm down here because
of a misunderstanding.

1220
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,139
- That's why...
- Misunderstanding, my ass.

1221
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,108
This motherfucker came
here to get fucked up.

1222
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,777
This is my city.

1223
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,345
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you.

1224
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:45,613
But I'm on your side!

1225
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,382
- Take it outside, Danny.
- Wait a minute.

1226
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:48,816
- Let's go.
- Stop!

1227
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:49,851
- It's his own fault.
- What the fuck?

1228
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:51,452
Because of something he wrote?

1229
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,887
- Take it outside!
- Come on. Go.

1230
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:54,188
- Come on.
- Get him out.

1231
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,390
- Let's go.
- Get him out!

1232
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,191
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1233
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,467
You ain't from here either!

1234
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,432
Yeah, you piece of shit.

1235
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:06,134
This ain't your city, motherfucker!

1236
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:07,902
What are you gonna do, huh?

1237
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,638
20 of you against this old man for
something he wrote in the newspaper?

1238
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,140
Ain't none of your business,
Mickey, so stay out of it!

1239
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,042
Shut the fuck up!!
I don't give a fuck!

1240
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:16,044
Not this!

1241
01:20:16,045 --> 01:20:18,138
Get in your car.

1242
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,714
Get him!

1243
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,321
Watch the step.

1244
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,044
Morning, Mick.

1245
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:58,535
Morning.

1246
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:00,882
You want some breakfast?

1247
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:04,018
I can't even think about food
this time of the morning.

1248
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,454
We better go practice, Sophie.

1249
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:07,922
You want to come along, Mick?

1250
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,924
I'm gonna read the paper.

1251
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,526
You don't mind if we do.

1252
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:13,802
It's all right. Just be careful.

1253
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,696
Mm-hmm.

1254
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:16,864
Oh.

1255
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,199
Let me get those.

1256
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,233
Jesus.

1257
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:20,968
Would you put something
on those legs?

1258
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:22,703
Yeah.

1259
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:23,838
Sweetheart.

1260
01:22:23,839 --> 01:22:25,636
Yeah.

1261
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,611
Ah, Christ.

1262
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,447
We got to keep our guard up, Mick.

1263
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,949
You never fucking know.

1264
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,853
Bird, I can't stay forever.

1265
01:22:38,854 --> 01:22:41,456
I got to get a job,
start something.

1266
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:44,826
You'll be here when
they come, Mick.

1267
01:22:44,827 --> 01:22:46,886
You'll know what to do.

1268
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,322
A little bit to your left.

1269
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,726
Okay, that was better.

1270
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:23,338
Yeah, yeah... and try not to shake.

1271
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:32,340
<i>Last night I had a
fight with a bottle</i>

1272
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:36,377
<i>A bottle full of whiskey bourbon</i>

1273
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:40,581
<i>I started a fight with a bottle</i>

1274
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:42,483
<i>And if you think I look bad</i>

1275
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:45,253
<i>You should see him</i>

1276
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:49,357
<i>Dad was a down-dirty fighter</i>

1277
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:53,694
<i>He taught us a lesson or two</i>

1278
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:57,865
<i>I may be a lovely young flower</i>

1279
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:02,103
<i>But I'll kick all
the dirt out of you</i>

1280
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:06,607
<i>Yeah, I was banging
nails with a hammer</i>

1281
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:10,778
<i>The day I found that
blood was really red</i>

1282
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:15,016
<i>Yeah, I was banging
nails with a hammer</i>

1283
01:24:15,017 --> 01:24:19,687
<i>It turned out that the
hammer was my head</i>

1284
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:23,624
<i>Mama was a cold-blooded lover</i>

1285
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:27,995
<i>She taught us a lesson or three</i>

1286
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:32,033
<i>I may be a lovely young flower</i>

1287
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:36,370
<i>But you won't take
the piss out of me</i>

1288
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:57,925
<i>Yeah, Dad was a down-dirty fighter</i>

1289
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:02,263
<i>He taught us a lesson or two</i>

1290
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:06,500
<i>I may be a lovely young flower</i>

1291
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:10,805
<i>But I'll kick all
the dirt out of you</i>

1292
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:15,109
