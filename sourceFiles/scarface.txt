00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:06,895
No, but l'm bored.

660
00:49:07,964 --> 00:49:09,989
Well, that figures.

661
00:49:11,768 --> 00:49:15,204
- Hey, check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.
- Yeah.

662
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:18,832
And, uh, you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

663
00:49:18,908 --> 00:49:21,604
- Good doin' business with you.
- Mr. Montana.

664
00:49:21,678 --> 00:49:23,612
Oh, God!

665
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:28,283
l wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

666
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:31,149
Plannin' on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

667
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,712
Oh, yeah.
You know who?

668
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:38,085
And what would Frank say?

669
00:49:39,662 --> 00:49:41,926
l like Frank, you know?

670
00:49:41,998 --> 00:49:44,432
Only l like you better.

671
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:50,061
[Snorting]

672
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:53,906
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

673
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,684
- [Tapping]
- Okay.

674
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:04,913
[Snorting]

675
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:10,258
- [Mutters]
- Okay.

676
00:50:11,995 --> 00:50:16,796
Don't get confused, Tony.
l don't fuck around with the help.

677
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,539
Okay.

678
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:28,270
You wanna play that way with me,
l play with you.

679
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:30,278
Shit.

680
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:33,577
- Would you kiss me if l wear the hat?
- No!

681
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:38,147
Playtime is over, okay?
[Laughing]

682
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:41,980
Okay.

683
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:23,791
[Knocking]

684
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:36,806
Mamá.

685
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,644
Antonio.

686
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:41,650
Long time.

687
00:51:43,553 --> 00:51:45,487
No postcards from jail?

688
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:56,866
¡Coño! Gina.

689
00:51:58,568 --> 00:51:59,967
[Gasps]
Tony?

690
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:03,904
- Oh, man, look at you. [Chuckles]
- [Laughs]

691
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:06,134
Hey, you're beautiful.

692
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,973
- l didn't--
- Mamá, look at those eyes, huh?

693
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:12,208
- Look at that. She looks like me.
- [Chuckles]

694
00:52:12,282 --> 00:52:15,251
You know the last time l saw you,
you was like that.

695
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:17,479
You looked like a little boy.

696
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:20,044
But now look at you.

697
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:24,783
Uh, l got something for you.

698
00:52:25,862 --> 00:52:28,524
[Exhales Deeply]

699
00:52:28,598 --> 00:52:31,123
For you.
This no big deal.

700
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:36,396
Oh, Tony!
[Crying]

701
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:46,237
- [Laughs]
- Oooh, Tony!

702
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:48,784
l never thought
l'd see you again, you know?

703
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:51,251
You think they're gonna keep
a guy like me down?

704
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:53,812
Well, no.
[Laughs] No.

705
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,253
[Sighs]
You look so good.

706
00:52:58,328 --> 00:53:02,424
Look. You open that up.
Open it.

707
00:53:02,498 --> 00:53:04,762
- For me?
- l think so.

708
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:09,630
lt's nothing much,
you know. Nothing.

709
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:13,301
- [Sighs]
- See?

710
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:15,310
Do you see what's written
on the back?

711
00:53:15,378 --> 00:53:19,109
On the back?
[Sighs]

712
00:53:19,182 --> 00:53:23,118
- ''Always.''
- ''Always.'' lt's beautiful, Tony!

713
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:27,019
So Mamá is still working
in the factory,

714
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,354
and l'm working part-time
in a beauty parlor.

715
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:32,292
l'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram González?

716
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:35,160
His father owned that barbershop.
lt's his place.

717
00:53:35,231 --> 00:53:37,893
Plus l go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

718
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:41,130
And in two more years,
l get my cosmetology license.

719
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:44,970
- And then l'll be making enough money--
- Surprise!

720
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:48,636
All that's over...
starting today.

721
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:53,239
- Why?
- My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor,

722
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:57,377
and Mamá, she don't have to sew
in no factory.

723
00:53:57,453 --> 00:53:59,819
Your son made it, Mamá.

724
00:54:00,823 --> 00:54:03,257
He's a success.

725
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:06,625
That's why l didn't
come around before.

726
00:54:06,696 --> 00:54:11,099
l want you to see
what a good boy l been.

727
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,231
Here's a thousand dollars.

728
00:54:15,304 --> 00:54:17,829
For you, Mamá.

729
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:19,841
[Clears Throat]

730
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,378
- Who did you kill for this, Antonio?
- Mamá.

731
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,283
l didn't kill nobody, Mamá.

732
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:32,651
- No?
- No.

733
00:54:32,722 --> 00:54:35,122
What are you doing now?

734
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:38,319
Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?

735
00:54:38,394 --> 00:54:40,794
No! Things are different now.

736
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:43,923
l'm working
with an anti-Castro group.

737
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,198
l'm an organizer now, and l get
a lot of political contributions.

738
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:50,535
Sure you do.

739
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:58,408
A gun sticking
in somebody's face is how.

740
00:54:59,749 --> 00:55:04,209
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

741
00:55:04,287 --> 00:55:08,747
is animals like you
and the killings.

742
00:55:08,825 --> 00:55:11,726
lt's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

743
00:55:11,794 --> 00:55:15,161
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

744
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:17,927
- People who send
their children to school--
- Mamá! What are you saying?

745
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,525
- That's your son!
- [Shouts] Son?

746
00:55:20,603 --> 00:55:23,800
- l wish l had one. He's a bum.
- No. No.

747
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:27,309
He was a bum then,
and he's a bum now.

748
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:33,077
Who do you think
you are, hmm?

749
00:55:33,149 --> 00:55:36,550
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

750
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:39,144
Cinco años.

751
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:42,157
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

752
00:55:42,225 --> 00:55:44,921
and think you can get
my respect.

753
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:47,986
-You think you can buy me with jewelry?
-Come on, Mamá.

754
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:51,397
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

755
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:53,765
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

756
00:55:53,836 --> 00:55:58,273
- Mamá, you don't know
what you're talking about.
- That's not the way l am!

757
00:55:58,341 --> 00:56:02,801
That is not the way
l raised Gina to be!

758
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:07,043
You are not going
to destroy her.

759
00:56:07,116 --> 00:56:10,950
l don't need your money.
Gracias.

760
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,352
l work for my living.

761
00:56:13,422 --> 00:56:16,357
l don't want you
in this house anymore!

762
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:19,360
l don't want you around Gina.

763
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:22,090
So, come on. Get out!

764
00:56:27,336 --> 00:56:29,600
Okay.

765
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:36,377
- No. Mamá--
- And take this lousy money with you.

766
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:38,936
- lt stinks.
- Tony--

767
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:44,117
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody, huh?

768
00:56:46,122 --> 00:56:49,387
l'm sorry, Tony.

769
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:51,892
Okay, Mamá.

770
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,921
Oh, no, no.
Tony, wait a minute!

771
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:59,126
- Don't go, please!
- Gina, stay here!

772
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:02,602
- [Gina] No, no, no, Mamá--
- [Mamá] He's no good. Gina!

773
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:05,106
- Tony, wait, please!
- Gina!

774
00:57:05,174 --> 00:57:09,543
l'm sorry. l don't know, Mamá--
Ever since Papá left she's--

775
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:12,376
Forget Papá.
We never had one.

776
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:15,178
l know you did
some bad things back then.

777
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:18,118
ln the army, l know
you got into some trouble.

778
00:57:18,187 --> 00:57:20,917
The Communists, they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

779
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,050
- Mamá doesn't understand that.
- l know.

780
00:57:26,095 --> 00:57:30,896
l just-- l don't know. l just want you
to know, you know, l don't care.

781
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:35,267
lt doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.

782
00:57:37,406 --> 00:57:40,807
You're my blood, always.

783
00:57:42,044 --> 00:57:44,444
l know. l know.

784
00:57:53,623 --> 00:57:56,956
- Come on. Come on.
l want you to take this.
- l gotta go back in.

785
00:57:57,026 --> 00:57:59,688
- No, Tony. Please. Tony.
- You need this. Come on.

786
00:57:59,762 --> 00:58:03,163
- What am l gonna tell her?
- Take that. You don't
tell her anything.

787
00:58:03,232 --> 00:58:06,497
Don't tell her l give it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

788
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:09,333
And listen, you go out yourself,
you know?

789
00:58:09,405 --> 00:58:12,897
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

790
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:15,409
You gotta get some fun
out of life.

791
00:58:15,478 --> 00:58:20,279
You gonna beat yourself to death at 19?
Pussycat like you?

792
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:22,681
- Come here.
- Mmm.

793
00:58:24,453 --> 00:58:26,683
- l'll talk to you again, all right?
- Okay.

794
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:30,385
- Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.
- l'll talk to her.

795
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:33,257
- Okay. l'll talk to you.
- [Train Whistle Blowing]

796
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:35,593
Okay.

797
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:38,429
Okay, let's go.

798
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:40,435
She's beautiful.

799
00:58:40,503 --> 00:58:43,336
- How come you--
- Hey!

800
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:48,002
Stay away from her, man.
You hear?

801
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:51,774
- She not for you.
- Okay.

802
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:20,572
So this and my other factory,
l can guarantee production...

803
00:59:20,643 --> 00:59:24,773
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

804
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:27,042
The problem is
l have no steady market.

805
00:59:27,116 --> 00:59:30,574
Basically, what l'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

806
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:33,315
who can share the risk with me,

807
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:38,417
somebody who can guarantee
to buy from me, say, 150 kilos a month.

808
00:59:38,494 --> 00:59:41,725
Oh! That's a big commitment,
Mr. Sosa.

809
00:59:41,797 --> 00:59:44,061
Something like that, uh--

810
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:47,068
lt's too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

811
00:59:47,136 --> 00:59:50,333
- lt would've been nice
if he could have come.
- He would like to come,

812
00:59:50,406 --> 00:59:54,342
but with his trial coming up, it's hard
for him to get out of the country.

813
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,039
- So he sent you instead?
- Yeah, something like that.

814
00:59:58,114 --> 01:00:00,844
We'll talk at my house,
shall we?

815
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:04,317
You got good stuff here.
Class 'A' shit.

816
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:31,177
So this López guarantees to buy from me
150 kilos every month of the year.

817
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:33,306
He picks it up here.

818
01:00:33,382 --> 01:00:38,149
l can sell it to him for as little as,
uh... 7,000 a key.

819
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,121
You cannot do better than that.

820
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:44,591
Yeah, but then we gotta
take the risk of moving it.

821
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,493
Also, we'll be cutting out the
Colombians. You know what that means?

822
01:00:47,563 --> 01:00:49,554
That means we have
to go to war with them.

823
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:52,897
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

824
01:00:52,968 --> 01:00:56,460
Why don't we split the risk?

825
01:00:56,539 --> 01:01:00,839
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama.

826
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,572
We take it from there.

827
01:01:05,014 --> 01:01:07,073
Panama is risky.

828
01:01:07,149 --> 01:01:09,947
lt costs me more.

829
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:12,749
Panama l can sell for...

830
01:01:12,822 --> 01:01:14,756
13.5 a key.

831
01:01:14,824 --> 01:01:17,759
13.5?
What, are you nuts?

832
01:01:19,662 --> 01:01:23,428
13.5? We still gotta take
that shit to Florida, man.

833
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:27,799
Do you know what that's like
these days? You got the fucking navy.

834
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:32,637
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

835
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:35,973
You got the fucking
Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass.

836
01:01:36,045 --> 01:01:39,139
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

837
01:01:39,215 --> 01:01:42,810
That's no duck walk anymore, man,
let me tell you.

838
01:01:42,885 --> 01:01:44,944
Forget about 13.5.

839
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:48,079
- [Phone Ringing]
- Well,

840
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:50,717
what do you suggest
that is reasonable?

841
01:01:50,793 --> 01:01:53,023
[Ringing Continues]

842
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:58,062
Excuse me one moment.

843
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:05,599
Hey, Montana, what the fuck's
the matter with you?

844
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:08,268
- You negotiating for Frank López, huh?
- Don't worry about it.

845
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:11,472
- Take it easy.
- l'm not worried about it.

846
01:02:11,547 --> 01:02:15,142
You should worry about it. lf he wants
to make a deal, it's up to him, not you.

847
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:18,778
- We're gonna do
this one deal. That's it.
- Fuck you. How's that?

848
01:02:20,556 --> 01:02:22,524
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

849
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:25,458
[Omar] You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

850
01:02:25,528 --> 01:02:28,725
- That's it. Let it go at that.
- Don't worry about it.

851
01:02:28,797 --> 01:02:31,425
Your head is in the wrong place.
You got to watch out for yourself.

852
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,901
Why don't you talk to him
about it? You think he
wants to give you the money?

853
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:39,600
- Shut the fuck up.
- l'm doing the talking here, not you.

854
01:02:39,675 --> 01:02:43,702
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

855
01:02:43,779 --> 01:02:47,180
Better than your front, let me tell you.
That's easier to watch.

856
01:02:47,249 --> 01:02:49,183
[Omar]
Close your mouth.

857
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:52,948
l can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

858
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:56,822
Just shut up.
l'm doing the talking here.

859
01:02:56,892 --> 01:02:59,326
- Now where were we?
- Panama.

860
01:02:59,395 --> 01:03:01,829
You're looking
for a partner, right?

861
01:03:02,932 --> 01:03:04,866
Something like that.

862
01:03:04,934 --> 01:03:09,132
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

863
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:13,573
l am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

864
01:03:13,642 --> 01:03:16,076
That's my limit.
l got no right--

865
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:19,273
- Nobody got no right
to negotiate for Frank--
- Let the man finish, okay?

866
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:22,317
Let him propose a proposition;
then we can talk more.

867
01:03:22,384 --> 01:03:24,409
You got no authority here.

868
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:27,216
l started you in this fucking business,
so shut the fuck up.

869
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:30,986
- Frank is gonna love it.
Don't worry about it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

870
01:03:34,463 --> 01:03:36,488
l'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

871
01:03:36,565 --> 01:03:39,090
No, it is all right.

872
01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:42,626
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

873
01:03:45,274 --> 01:03:47,640
Well, good.

874
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:51,009
l don't think it's something
l wanna do on an overseas phone.

875
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:56,177
But as soon as l get back to Miami,
l will talk to Frank personally.

876
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:58,583
Good.

877
01:03:58,654 --> 01:04:01,487
My associates here
can escort you to my chopper.

878
01:04:01,557 --> 01:04:04,025
My chopper can take you
to Santa Cruz.

879
01:04:04,093 --> 01:04:07,085
l have a jet there,
can have you in Miami in five hours.

880
01:04:07,162 --> 01:04:09,426
You should be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

881
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,434
Good. Good. Good.

882
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:13,696
Good. Good. Good.

883
01:04:13,769 --> 01:04:16,033
Hasta mañana.

884
01:04:16,105 --> 01:04:18,596
Good talking to you.

885
01:04:18,674 --> 01:04:21,268
Why don't you leave
your friend here?

886
01:04:21,343 --> 01:04:24,107
While you are gone, maybe he can
tell me how to run my business.

887
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:26,977
- l think Frank would like to see him--
- No, that's okay.

888
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:30,348
You tell Frank l keeping
this guy on ice for him.

[Sosa]
Let's finish our lunch.

892
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,901
l have to hand it
to you, Mr. Sosa.

893
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:51,030
You got everything
a man could want.

894
01:04:52,307 --> 01:04:56,641
l like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

895
01:04:56,712 --> 01:05:01,149
Unfortunately, l do not feel the same
about the rest of your organization.

[Helicopter Whirring Overhead]

897
01:05:04,453 --> 01:05:07,422
What do you mean
by that, Mr. Sosa?

898
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:09,923
l'm talking about Omar Suárez.

899
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:16,354
- This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...
- [Helicopter Whirring]

900
01:05:16,432 --> 01:05:20,698
from several years ago
in New York.

901
01:05:23,706 --> 01:05:26,800
He was an informer
for the police.

902
01:05:38,153 --> 01:05:40,348
[Omar Screaming]

903
01:05:42,591 --> 01:05:46,493
[Sosa] He put Vito Duval
and the Ramos brothers, Nello and Gino,

904
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:49,395
away for life.

905
01:05:51,433 --> 01:05:55,267
So how do l know you're not
a chivato too, Tony?

906
01:05:58,373 --> 01:06:00,864
Hey, Sosa.

907
01:06:02,377 --> 01:06:06,211
Let's get this straight now.

908
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:10,377
l never fucked anybody over in my life
didn't have it comin' to him.

909
01:06:10,452 --> 01:06:13,012
You got that?

910
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:16,717
All l have in this life
is my balls and my word,

911
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:21,354
and l don't break 'em for no one,
you understand?

912
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:25,833
That piece of shit up there,
l never like him, l never trusted him.

913
01:06:25,901 --> 01:06:30,167
For all l know, he had me set up and had
my friend, Ángel Fernández, killed.

914
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,003
But that's history.
l'm here, he's not.

915
01:06:33,075 --> 01:06:35,635
You wanna go on with me, say it.

916
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:38,077
You don't, then you make a move.

917
01:06:43,218 --> 01:06:45,982
l think you speak
from the heart, Montana.

918
01:06:46,054 --> 01:06:48,955
But l say to myself,

919
01:06:49,024 --> 01:06:52,050
this López, your boss,

920
01:06:52,127 --> 01:06:55,585
he had chivatos like that
working for him.

921
01:06:55,664 --> 01:06:58,098
His judgment stinks.

922
01:07:00,068 --> 01:07:04,971
So l think to myself, how many
other mistakes has this López guy made?

923
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:10,711
How can l trust his organization?

924
01:07:10,779 --> 01:07:13,304
You tell me, Tony.

01:07:14,183 --> 01:07:16,845
Frank is smart, you know?

926
01:07:19,388 --> 01:07:22,915
You can't blame him
for that animal.

lt's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

928
01:07:25,994 --> 01:07:28,622
That could happen to anyone,
even you.

929
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:38,870
Why don't l go back
and talk to Frank...

930
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:41,171
and work it out?

931
01:07:41,243 --> 01:07:43,677

Just remember--
l'll only tell you one time--

01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:04,364
don't fuck me, Tony.

01:08:06,635 --> 01:08:09,729
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

You what?

939
01:08:24,786 --> 01:08:28,620
You made a deal
for a fucking $18 million...

940
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,851
without even checking with me?

941
01:08:30,926 --> 01:08:33,394
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

942
01:08:33,462 --> 01:08:35,555
- Coño, Frank. Take it easy.
- ¡Coño, my ass!

943
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:38,225
At 10.5 a key, it's puro.

944
01:08:39,701 --> 01:08:42,534
You can't lose money.
No way.

945
01:08:44,072 --> 01:08:48,406
We make 75 million
on this deal, Frank.

946
01:08:48,477 --> 01:08:51,275
Seventy-five million.

947
01:08:51,346 --> 01:08:53,371
That is serious money.

948
01:08:53,448 --> 01:08:57,885
What the fuck is Sosa
going to do when l don't come up
with the first five million?

949
01:08:57,953 --> 01:09:01,480
What is he gonna do?
ls he gonna send me a bill?

950
01:09:01,556 --> 01:09:04,320
He's gonna send
a fucking hit squad up here!

951
01:09:04,393 --> 01:09:06,861
Relax! Take it easy.

952
01:09:06,929 --> 01:09:10,057
l'm in tight with Sosa.

953
01:09:10,132 --> 01:09:13,568
You short a couple of mil,
l go on the street for you.

954
01:09:13,635 --> 01:09:16,729
l make a couple of moves,

955
01:09:16,805 --> 01:09:19,467
a mil here, a mil there,
you got it.

956
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:21,475
Okay?

957
01:09:23,378 --> 01:09:28,543
Oh, you've been making moves
on your own, huh?

958
01:09:28,617 --> 01:09:32,485
l got ears, you know?
l hear things.

959
01:09:32,554 --> 01:09:35,523
Yeah?

960
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:38,582
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Díaz brothers?

961
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:42,824
What about Gaspar Gómez?
What is he gonna do when you
start moving 2,000 keys--

962
01:09:42,898 --> 01:09:46,857
Fuck Gaspar Gómez and fuck
the fucking Díaz brothers!

963
01:09:46,935 --> 01:09:49,563
Fuck 'em all!

964
01:09:49,638 --> 01:09:52,368
l bury those cockroaches!

965
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:54,705
What they ever do for us?

966
01:10:02,784 --> 01:10:07,244
Look, Frank, the time has come.

967
01:10:07,322 --> 01:10:09,722
We gotta expand.

968
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:13,887
The whole operation.
Distribution.

969
01:10:13,962 --> 01:10:17,830
New York, Chicago, L.A.

970
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:22,302
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

971
01:10:22,371 --> 01:10:24,862
We gotta think big now.

972
01:10:28,777 --> 01:10:31,211
Think big.

973
01:10:35,951 --> 01:10:37,919
Like your friend Sosa.

974
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:43,546
Let me tell you something about
that greaseball cocksucker.

975
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:46,150
He is a snake,
that's what he is.

976
01:10:48,463 --> 01:10:53,196
You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.

977
01:10:53,268 --> 01:10:56,726
You don't trust a guy like that.

978
01:10:56,805 --> 01:10:59,774
You want me to believe...

979
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:04,210
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

980
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:07,009
You bought that line.

981
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:10,210
Maybe l made a mistake
sending you down there.

982
01:11:11,553 --> 01:11:14,681
Maybe you and Sosa
know something l don't know.

983
01:11:17,259 --> 01:11:19,227
Like what?

984
01:11:19,294 --> 01:11:21,819
Like what?

985
01:11:21,897 --> 01:11:24,764
[Chuckling]
You tell me like what?

986
01:11:29,538 --> 01:11:33,099
You calling me a liar, Frank?

987
01:11:33,175 --> 01:11:35,643
That what you calling me?

988
01:11:40,782 --> 01:11:44,513
Let's just say l want things
to stay the way they are for now.

989
01:11:47,956 --> 01:11:50,550

with 20 million
of your hard-earned dollars?

1478
01:48:31,509 --> 01:48:33,773
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.

1479
01:48:33,845 --> 01:48:37,941
Who else can you trust? That's why
you pay us what you do. You trust us.

1480
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:40,075
Huh?

1481
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:46,848
Did you hear that guy? You gotta
listen to him. You'll learn something.

1482
01:48:46,925 --> 01:48:51,385
Stay with us. You're an old
and well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1483
01:48:54,199 --> 01:48:56,429
- And l gotta run.
- l'm safe but poor.

1484
01:48:58,136 --> 01:49:01,037
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.

1485
01:49:01,106 --> 01:49:04,200
[Laughing] Say hello
to the princess for me, will you?

1486
01:49:04,275 --> 01:49:06,243
- She's beautiful.
- Okay.

1487
01:49:06,311 --> 01:49:09,246
- l'll see you. Take care.
- You too.

1488
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:17,654
[Tony]
Come here.

1489
01:49:23,461 --> 01:49:26,157
That prick!

1490
01:49:26,231 --> 01:49:28,358
Fuckin' WASP whore.

1491
01:49:28,433 --> 01:49:32,767
Talkin' to me like l--
l some maricón come over on a boat.

1492
01:49:32,837 --> 01:49:34,828
l tell you what.

1493
01:49:34,906 --> 01:49:37,306
We don't need that
smilin' motherfucker.

1494
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:41,209
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1495
01:49:41,279 --> 01:49:46,740
He's got his own exchange.
He charges four percent at
the most. And he's connected.

1496
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:50,014
Fuck 'em.

1497
01:49:50,088 --> 01:49:53,615
- Mob guys. Guineas.
- [Snorting]

1498
01:49:53,692 --> 01:49:56,024
l don't trust 'em.

1499
01:50:13,278 --> 01:50:16,145
Hey, Manny.
Did you sweep the house this month?

1500
01:50:16,214 --> 01:50:18,205
The cars?

1501
01:50:18,283 --> 01:50:22,913
Yeah. l told you about it.
The $5,000?

1502
01:50:22,987 --> 01:50:25,717
- Look at that.
- [Sniffs] What?

1503
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:27,724
[Tony]
That cable truck there.

1504
01:50:27,792 --> 01:50:30,920
Since when does it take
three days to rig a cable?

1505
01:50:33,498 --> 01:50:36,058
What? You been watching it
for three days?

1506
01:50:38,002 --> 01:50:42,564
The fuckin' thing has been there
for three days? What am l
gonna do, not look at it?

1507
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:45,871
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- l don't know.

1508
01:50:45,944 --> 01:50:49,311
Could be the Díaz brothers,
come to get me.

1509
01:50:51,082 --> 01:50:53,607
Maybe.
l'll check it out, okay?

1510
01:50:53,685 --> 01:50:57,781
You check it out. Then we're gonna blow
that fuckin' truck back to Colombia!

1511
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:01,181
Come on, come on.
Monina.

1512
01:51:01,259 --> 01:51:04,524
We're not the only dopers living
on the block, okay? Remember that.

1513
01:51:04,596 --> 01:51:08,532
That fucking truck, that
could be anybody and anything.
lt could be a cable company--

1514
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,592
You know something?
You got some fuckin' attitude.

1515
01:51:11,669 --> 01:51:14,137
For someone who's in charge
of my security--

1516
01:51:14,205 --> 01:51:19,142
Here. Here are the keys to
the front door. Go down there.
Give 'em the fuckin' keys!

1517
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:21,235
- l'm just tryin' to say something.
- What?

1518
01:51:21,312 --> 01:51:25,442
- You're spending a lot of money
on this countersurveillance.
- l don't give a fuck.

1519
01:51:25,517 --> 01:51:29,647
lt's already twelve percent
of our adjusted gross.
Twelve percent is not peanuts.

1520
01:51:29,721 --> 01:51:33,714
l don't give a fuck! lt makes me sleep
good at night. That's what counts.

1521
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:36,192
- Okay? You worry about it.
- l am worried about it.

1522
01:51:36,261 --> 01:51:39,424
l'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1523
01:51:39,497 --> 01:51:43,092
Our thinking,
our fuckin' attitude, you know?

1524
01:51:43,168 --> 01:51:45,159
We're not fuckin' hungry anymore.

1525
01:51:45,236 --> 01:51:45,270
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.

1526
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:47,966
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.

1527
01:51:48,039 --> 01:51:49,973
New construction.
New jobs.

1528
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:52,908
Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.

1529
01:51:52,977 --> 01:51:57,812
We've been putting your money
to work for 75 years building
a more prosperous Miami.

1530
01:51:57,882 --> 01:52:00,282
- Count on us being here tomorrow.
- [Tony] Oh, yeah?

1531
01:52:00,351 --> 01:52:03,252
That's because for 75 years
you been fuckin' everybody.

1532
01:52:03,321 --> 01:52:06,984
Somebody should do something
about these-- these whores.

1533
01:52:07,058 --> 01:52:09,322
l mean, chargin' me
ten points on my money.

1534
01:52:09,394 --> 01:52:14,229
They're gettin' away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1535
01:52:14,299 --> 01:52:16,233
- Forget it, man.
- l mean, anything goes.

1536
01:52:16,301 --> 01:52:20,362
They been around a thousand years.
They got all the angles figured out.

1537
01:52:20,438 --> 01:52:23,874
You know what capitalism is?
Gettin' fucked.

1538
01:52:23,942 --> 01:52:26,137
[Elvira]
True capitalist if ever l met one.

1539
01:52:26,211 --> 01:52:30,147
- [TV Shuts Off]
- Uh-oh. Did you hear that?

1540
01:52:30,215 --> 01:52:32,206
How would you know, bubblehead?

1541
01:52:32,283 --> 01:52:37,311
You ever do nothin' besides get
your hair fixed and powder your nose?

1542
01:52:37,388 --> 01:52:40,084
Look at it. You do too much
of that shit, you know?

1543
01:52:40,158 --> 01:52:42,626
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1544
01:52:42,694 --> 01:52:46,357
- You should know that, Tony.
- l should know what?

1545
01:52:46,431 --> 01:52:48,797
What should l know?

1546
01:52:48,867 --> 01:52:52,030
Why do you have to talk to me
like that all the time for?

1547
01:52:52,103 --> 01:52:55,231
- Like l gotta know something.
- Let me talk to you.

1548
01:52:55,306 --> 01:52:58,764
- Listen to me.
This Seidelbaum. Five to 7:00.
- What time is it?

1549
01:52:58,843 --> 01:53:01,676
- Okay.
- Okay?

1550
01:53:01,746 --> 01:53:05,079
- l met with this guy--
- The drug-related violence
that's plagued south Florida...

1551
01:53:05,149 --> 01:53:07,117
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1552
01:53:07,185 --> 01:53:09,551
forces one to ask a question:

1553
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:12,647
How, with a small law enforcement
budget, can you put a dent...

1554
01:53:12,724 --> 01:53:17,718
on an estimated
$100 billion-a-year business?

1555
01:53:17,795 --> 01:53:21,060
lt seems at times all you can do
is put your finger in the dike and pray.

1556
01:53:21,132 --> 01:53:23,464
Put your fingers in a dike?

1557
01:53:23,534 --> 01:53:28,062
The only place you can
get your fingers in some dyke.

1558
01:53:28,139 --> 01:53:33,668
Not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.

1559
01:53:33,745 --> 01:53:39,308
These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.

1560
01:53:39,384 --> 01:53:41,511
l am not one of those voices.

1561
01:53:41,586 --> 01:53:43,577
l know that.
But you know why, Vic?

1562
01:53:43,655 --> 01:53:46,590
'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.

1563
01:53:46,658 --> 01:53:48,683
That fuckin' guy,
he never tells the truth.

1564
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:52,423
...splendor of our city
at its best.

1565
01:53:52,497 --> 01:53:55,955
lt's those guys, man!
lt's the fuckin' bankers,
the politicians--

1566
01:53:56,034 --> 01:53:57,968
they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

1567
01:53:58,036 --> 01:54:01,665
So they can make the fuckin' money,
and they get the fuckin' votes!

1568
01:54:01,739 --> 01:54:05,334
They fightin' the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1569
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:07,344
They fuck anything and anyone--

1570
01:54:07,412 --> 01:54:10,677
Can't you stop saying ''fuck''
all the time?

1571
01:54:10,748 --> 01:54:13,683
Can't you stop talking about money?
lt's boring, Tony.

1572
01:54:13,751 --> 01:54:17,380
Where's this comin' from, man?
Boring? What's boring?

1573
01:54:17,455 --> 01:54:19,389
- You're boring.
- Oh.

1574
01:54:19,457 --> 01:54:23,120
Money, money, money, money, money.
That's all l ever hear in this house.

1575
01:54:23,194 --> 01:54:26,288
Manny, look at the pelican fly.
Come on, pelican!

1576
01:54:26,364 --> 01:54:29,026
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

1577
01:54:30,601 --> 01:54:33,263
Oh.

1578
01:54:33,338 --> 01:54:36,671
That's 'cause
he was so smart, you know?

1579
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:38,675
[Tony Muttering]

1580
01:54:38,743 --> 01:54:41,837
Cuidado. Se te cae.

1581
01:54:41,913 --> 01:54:44,677
You know what
you're becoming, Tony?

1582
01:54:44,749 --> 01:54:47,081
You're an immigrant
spic millionaire...

1583
01:54:47,151 --> 01:54:49,085
who can't stop talking about
how much money he's got--

1584
01:54:49,153 --> 01:54:51,485
Who you callin' a spic,
you white piece of bread?

1585
01:54:51,556 --> 01:54:53,751
Get out of the way
of the television!

1586
01:54:53,825 --> 01:54:56,623
Why don't you dig a hole
in the garden and bury it?

1587
01:54:56,694 --> 01:55:00,095
l work hard for this!
l want you to know that.

1588
01:55:02,967 --> 01:55:07,028
lt's too bad.
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

1589
01:55:07,105 --> 01:55:11,769
Oh. You know what
your problem is, pussycat?

1590
01:55:11,843 --> 01:55:14,073
What is my problem?

1591
01:55:14,145 --> 01:55:17,581
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1592
01:55:17,648 --> 01:55:20,776
Why don't you get a job
or something, you know?

1593
01:55:20,852 --> 01:55:23,753
Do something.
Be a nurse.

1594
01:55:23,821 --> 01:55:27,188
Work with blind kids, lepers.

1595
01:55:27,258 --> 01:55:31,627
Anything beats lying around all day
waitin' for me to fuck you!

1596
01:55:31,696 --> 01:55:34,688
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1597
01:55:34,766 --> 01:55:36,893
Oh, no?
Frank was better, huh?

1598
01:55:38,469 --> 01:55:40,903
You're an asshole!

1599
01:55:40,972 --> 01:55:43,167
Where you going?
Come here!

1600
01:55:43,241 --> 01:55:47,371
Hey, Elvie!
l was kidding!

1601
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,939
l was only kidding!

1602
01:55:51,015 --> 01:55:55,247
l guess sometimes married life is not
all it's cracked up to be, you know?

1603
01:55:55,319 --> 01:55:58,413
- Where you goin'?
- l got a date.

1604
01:55:58,489 --> 01:56:00,423
- You got a date?
- Yeah.

1605
01:56:00,491 --> 01:56:02,425
Come here.

1606
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:08,328
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.

1607
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:10,890
Yeah, it's all set up.

1608
01:56:10,968 --> 01:56:15,371
Yeah, well, you forget it.
Stay out of it. l take care of it.

1609
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,705
''Stay out of it''?
lt's my deal. l set it up.

1610
01:56:18,776 --> 01:56:21,142
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1611
01:56:21,212 --> 01:56:24,147
You like the ladies more than you like
the money. That's your problem.

1612
01:56:24,215 --> 01:56:27,742
What the fuck are you talking about?
l'm your partner, okay?

1613
01:56:27,819 --> 01:56:31,516
You're not gonna trust me with that
kind of thing, who you gonna trust?

1614
01:56:31,589 --> 01:56:34,922
- Junior partner.
- Bullshit, man.

1615
01:56:34,992 --> 01:56:38,587
Hey, don't talk to me about trust.
l don't like it.

1616
01:56:38,663 --> 01:56:43,191
You should listen to your wife.
She's right. You are an asshole, man!

1617
01:56:43,267 --> 01:56:46,031
Come here. Gimme a kiss.
Come here.

1618
01:56:46,104 --> 01:56:50,063
Hey. Hey!
Fuck you, man!

1619
01:56:50,141 --> 01:56:54,737
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1620
01:56:54,812 --> 01:56:57,713
Who do l trust? Me!

1621
01:56:57,782 --> 01:57:00,250
Fuck him. Trust.

1622
01:57:00,318 --> 01:57:02,513
Por nada.

1623
01:57:02,587 --> 01:57:06,284
Asshole.
Fuck called me an asshole.

1624
01:57:06,357 --> 01:57:09,451
l need that shit.

1625
01:57:09,527 --> 01:57:12,928
l don't need him,
and l don't need her.

1626
01:57:12,997 --> 01:57:16,728
Fuck 'em.
l don't need nobody!

1627
01:57:16,801 --> 01:57:16,834
Back then l worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1628
01:57:16,834 --> 01:57:19,632
Back then l worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1629
01:57:19,704 --> 01:57:22,502
l was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?

1630
01:57:22,573 --> 01:57:26,407
Ah, you saw me, with Marlon Brando.
You know, we're good friends.

1631
01:57:26,477 --> 01:57:28,911
- l was his driver.
- No shit?

1632
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:32,416
- Brando, huh?
- Yeah, they shot it there.

You have the right
to remain silent.

and will be taken against you.

a hundred grand, plus 300 in cash,

on the conspiracy charge.

1686
02:01:00,558 --> 02:01:05,586
But they're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion, and they'll get it.

Five years.

Maybe less, if l can make a deal.

Three fuckin' years!

For what?

02:01:26,951 --> 02:01:31,854
Washing money? The fuckin' country
was built on washed money.

- lt can't be that bad.
lt's not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?

Okay, now that's $800,000.

1701
02:02:04,121 --> 02:02:06,715
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

1702
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:14,363
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1703

l'm an expert
at raisin' that doubt.

the First Army Corps. Tony Montana.

l would like to discuss something
that is of interest to all of us here.

1727

You have a problem, Tony.

1728
02:04:00,804 --> 02:04:03,671
We... have a problem.

02:04:05,209 --> 02:04:08,645
l think together
we can solve all our problems.

1730
02:04:10,447 --> 02:04:12,972
We all know that you have
tax troubles in your country...

1731
02:04:13,050 --> 02:04:16,315
and that you may have
to do a little time.

1732
02:04:16,387 --> 02:04:21,017
But we have some friends
in Washington that assure us
these troubles can be taken care of.

1733
02:04:21,091 --> 02:04:23,685
You may have to pay
some back taxes, a big fine,

1734
02:04:23,761 --> 02:04:26,389
but, uh,
there will be no prison.

l've heard whispers about financial
support your government receives...

1739
02:04:38,475 --> 02:04:40,409
from the drug industry
in Bolivia.

1740
02:04:40,477 --> 02:04:45,471
Well, the irony of this is that
this money, which is in the billions,

1741
02:04:45,549 --> 02:04:47,483
is coming from your country.

1742
02:04:47,551 --> 02:04:50,987
You are the major purchaser
of our national product,

1743
02:04:51,055 --> 02:04:52,989
which is cocaine.

1744
02:04:53,057 --> 02:04:56,083
On one hand you're saying
the United States government...

1745
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:59,857
is spending millions of dollars
to eliminate the flow of drugs
onto our streets.

1746
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:04,264
At the same time, we are doing business
with the same government...

1747
02:05:04,335 --> 02:05:07,668
that is flooding
our streets with cocaine.

1748
02:05:07,738 --> 02:05:10,400
Sí. Let me show you
a few of the other characters...

1749
02:05:10,474 --> 02:05:13,272
that are involved
in this tragicomedy.

1750
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:16,609
My organization just recently
traced a large purchase...

1751
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:18,773
by this man.

1752
02:05:18,849 --> 02:05:22,012
This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.

1753
02:05:22,086 --> 02:05:26,318
He is the minister of the defense
of Bolivia, my country.

1754
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:29,052
And General Cucombre just
a couple of months ago...

1755
02:05:29,126 --> 02:05:33,654
bought a $12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.

1756
02:05:33,731 --> 02:05:36,859
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be
the Bolivian defense minister,

1757
02:05:36,934 --> 02:05:40,233
what is he doing living in Switzerland,
guarding cash registers?

1758
02:05:40,304 --> 02:05:42,864
This man here,

1759
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:46,432
Alejandro Sosa,
a very interesting character.

1760
02:05:46,510 --> 02:05:51,038
He's a wealthy landowner,
educated in England, very good family.

1761
02:05:51,115 --> 02:05:55,142
But this man is the business brain
and drug overlord...

1762
02:05:55,219 --> 02:05:58,154
of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.

1763
02:05:58,222 --> 02:06:01,214

- Yeah.
- That is our problem.

How could l forget him?

02:06:32,489 --> 02:06:36,585
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

He's going to help us
fix our problem.

02:06:40,898 --> 02:06:43,731
But he doesn't speak English.

1776
02:06:43,801 --> 02:06:46,929
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1777
02:06:47,004 --> 02:06:49,404
He needs a little help.

1778

1779
02:06:58,982 --> 02:07:00,916
No problem.

with the Bolivian situation?

1828
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:13,371
Her womb is so polluted,

1841
02:10:53,583 --> 02:10:56,814
- You don't even know
how to be a husband!
- Sit down before l--

1842
02:10:56,887 --> 02:11:01,153
Do we ever go anywhere without having

We're losers.

You don't have the guts

1866
02:12:34,184 --> 02:12:36,618
You need people like me.

1867

You need people like me

There's gonna be no trial.
