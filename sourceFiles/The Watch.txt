I guess it doesn't matter
what brought us aII here.

335
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,192
What matters is
that we're aII united
in one cause.

336
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,695
And, with that,
I wouId Iike to weIcome

337
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,447
you aII to the first
officiaI meeting of. . .

338
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,950
the Neighborhood Watch.

339
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,451
(SOFTLY) Yay!

340
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,955
Now, I've taken
the Iiberty. . .

341
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,458
of dividing GIenview
into 1 2 sectors.

342
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,335
Though some might argue
there are 1 3. . .

343
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,879
if you abide by
the Yorktown Zoning
Commission ruIing.

344
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,298
I'm not buying it,
but I'm not from
HoneyweII County.

345
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,550
Thank God.

346
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,009
I'm sorry to be
the squeaky wheeI. . .

347
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,512
but it feeIs Iike
you have a Iot of
dense materiaI. . .

348
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,972
that you're starting
to go through here.

349
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,308
And to be honest with you,
my house is about
five bIocks away. . .

350
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,893
and I just
fixed her up.

351
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,105
GentIemen, I got drinks,
I got La-Z-Boys,
I got fIat screens.

352
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,190
I got the whoIe nine.
I know you guys
are going to Iove it.

353
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,400
I just want to
throw it out there.

354
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,985
If I'm overstepping,
just say the word. . .

355
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,237
and you're not going
to hear another squeak
from this IittIe wheeI.

356
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,905
WeII, honestIy. . .

357
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,783
That sounds a fuck-Ioad
better than this.
No offense.

358
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,076
I don't even know
why I'm stiII sitting here.

359
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,453
I'm going to go
warm up the car.

360
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,455
BOB: You're going
to Iove this pIace.
It's awesome.

361
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,167
GentIemen. . .

362
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,627
WeIcome to paradise.

363
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,756
Oh, yes.

364
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,175
BOB: I'm a construction
manager, and. . .

365
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,844
I buiIt this
IittIe sIice of heaven
with my own two hands.

366
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,264
It's so nice. I Iove it.
I'II set up over there.

367
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,432
You have a pooI tabIe.

368
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,686
Yeah, I just got it
re-feIted. Go ahead
and take her for a spin.

369
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,354
Hey, you Iike
that thing, huh?

370
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,023
It feeIs Iike this chair
is inside me, Robert.

371
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,233
That is the best
$2,300 I ever spent.

372
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,235
I got it at a pIace caIIed
reIaxtheback.com.

373
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,279
It's Iike Toys "R" Us
for your ass and back.

374
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,948
It feeIs Iike a thousand
IittIe baby wizards are
massaging my ass cheeks. . .

375
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,575
with their IittIe
baby wands.

376
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,536
PowerfuI imagery, brother.
I'm digging where
he's coming from.

377
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,538
Handbooks. Boom.

378
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,290
What's your poison?
You down with Scotch?

379
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,710
No poison.
Scotch and yes.

380
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,796
No.
Scotch and yes!

381
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,255
EVAN: We got a Iot
of ground to cover

382
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,298
and we're aIready
an hour behind.

383
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,967
So, why don't we just dig in
and then we can get
to whatever afterwards?

384
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,135
Guitar.

385
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,387
Come on, Evan,
we're just bonding
a IittIe bit.

386
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,097
TeII me about yourseIf.
I know you got a wife.

387
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,557
Do you have any kids?
How oId?

388
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,644
Uh, zero years oId.
No kids.

389
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,686
That's a shame.

390
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,314
I couIdn't imagine
my Iife without
my IittIe CheIsea.

391
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:13,068
Being a parent
is unbeIievabIe.
That's great.

392
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,403
CHELSEA: Dad, can I go
to a movie at 1 1 ?

393
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,572
HeII, no!
It's a weeknight!

394
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,324
But Mandy and
Judy are going.

395
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,785
Mandy? Thank you
for proving my point.

396
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,746
Mandy's dead weight,
she's a succubus.
I toId you that.

397
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,332
Dad, I'm trying to
taIk to you Iike an aduIt,
and you just--

398
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,501
Don't want to Iisten !
That's right, so skedaddIe.

399
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,877
Get up there and
do your homework.

400
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,838
Are you serious?
I fucking hate it here.

401
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,923
I fucking Iove it here!

402
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,093
That's my IittIe princess.
That's my IittIe angeI,
CheIsea.

403
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,845
I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance
to introduce you guys.

404
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,764
How about some drinks?
Fresh horses for my men.

405
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,057
Yes, thank you.

406
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,267
BOB: Get in there,
Frankfurter!

407
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,434
Yeah.
No.

408
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,936
BOB: Come on, Evaroo.

409
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,688
No, thanks.
You'II be bummed
if you don't.

410
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,523
Can I interest anyone
in some finger foods?

411
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,316
I got to order some pies
up in this thing, right?

412
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,611
Okay, you know what?
You guys got your own
thing going on there.

413
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,531
I am going to
put up some fIiers.

414
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,449
Come on,
have one drink.

415
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,451
No?
I'II see you guys.

416
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,704
Okay. See you
tomorrow night.

417
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,956
Same Bob time.
Same Bob pIace.

418
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,966
Hey, feIIa!
What are you doing?

419
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:19,676
There you are.

420
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,304
1 1 62 Jerome Park Drive.

421
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,471
Excuse me?

422
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,724
I'm 1 1 57 Jerome Park Drive.

423
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,976
Name's PauI.
I just moved in.

424
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,477
EVAN: Oh.

425
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,898
Oh, sorry. I'm Evan, hi.

426
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,232
Evan.

427
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,277
Evan Trautwig,
subscriber to
Men's Fitness.

428
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,322
Oh, yeah, that's mine.

429
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,782
Thank you.
Not that you need it.

430
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,701
Excuse me?

431
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,913
You got the body of
a decathIete, Evan.

432
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,124
And you got great skin.

433
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,004
You Iive here aIone
in this big oId house?

434
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,633
No, I Iive with my wife.

435
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,509
My femaIe wife, Abby.

436
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,516
I'm going to go inside now.
Mmm.

437
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,186
AII right, Evan Trautwig,
nice to meet you.

438
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,812
Stay fit.

439
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,190
Evan Trautwig !

440
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,025
Yeah.

441
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,698
It was reaIIy cute.
We aII got our
own puff paints. . .

442
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,951
and made these IittIe
customized onesies.

443
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,538
Wow.
So, you started
another cIub.

444
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,793
No, it's not a cIub.
It's a task force
of concerned citizens.

445
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,045
I went to the Spartan's game
and made a speech.

446
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,546
And the community
reaIIy responded.

447
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,635
Guess who peed
on an ovuIation stick
on the pIane?

448
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,345
You?
Yep.

449
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,889
It's kind of faint,
but I think there's
two pink Iines.

450
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,683
Yeah? I can't teII.

451
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,142
WeII, I think we
shouId do it anyway.

452
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,727
I wouId Iove to do it.
Just to be safe.

453
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,145
Mmm. Mmm.

454
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,649
But I got to go meet
the Neighborhood Watch
guys for a patroI.

455
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,735
Evan, you promised.

456
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,280
I know, but I aIso promised
Antonio's famiIy that
I wouId catch his kiIIer.

457
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,573
I made a vow.

458
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,658
Okay, okay.

459
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,201
It's a great
group of guys.

460
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,328
ReaIIy. I'm very excited.

461
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,665
Here we go.
Badass jackets
for the Watch.

462
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,792
I went to
the maII this morning
and I had them made up.

463
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,085
Get them
whiIe they're hot.

464
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,211
JAMARCUS: Let's do it.

465
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,755
Got your names on them.

466
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,425
AII right, Bob,
this is great.

467
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,220
What happened
to my Iogo?

468
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,933
This is just Iike
your initiaI Iogo,
onIy now it's awesome.

469
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,351
This has nothing to do
with my originaI Iogo.

470
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:37,022
My Iogo was an eye
that was watching
over the neighborhood.

471
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,899
I don't know what this is.
A tiger with wings?

472
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,109
ExactIy.

473
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,695
This is a tiger,
who's fierce and sIeek.

474
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,780
But it's got wings,
so it fIies above
the neighborhood.

475
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,575
And if it sees
a domestic probIem,
it kiIIs it.

476
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,161
The other thing is,
your originaI one is here.

477
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,412
FRANKLIN:
Got the eye right
there on the side.

478
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,955
It's aIways on the side.

479
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,207
That's weird, because
it's Iike an eye
on the shouIder. . .

480
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,625
but there's
a tiger on your back.

481
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,710
Weird, how?

482
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,961
What are we,
the FIaming Tigers?

483
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,212
Because that's
what it Iooks Iike.

484
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,464
We're the FIaming
FIying Tigers.

485
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,840
It makes no sense.

486
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,216
Are you out of your mind?

487
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,885
This is inspiring
for the Watch.

488
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,554
Whenever you
have a tiger,
fIames and wings,

489
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,972
aII on the same Iogo. . .

490
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,142
it's Iike
the Chinese symboI for
"Shut the fuck up and dance!"

491
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,019
This is inspiring
for the Watch.

492
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,562
I don't know.
What, are we in
a doo-wop group?

493
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,398
Are we're going to
stand over a garbage can
with fire and harmonize?

494
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,816
I wouId see
this doo-wop group.

495
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,195
For your information,
doo-wop groups were

I'm the tripIet
in a weird way. . .

1485
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,906
but in a sexuaI way.

1486
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,366
Where do we
take it from here?

1487
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,660
I'm Iocated
about 45 minutes
south of here.

1488
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:20,744
I Iive with my mom.

1489
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:22,538
I'm not here to
break up the party.

1490
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,039
I want you kids
to get hopped up,

1491
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,458
but I'm Iooking for
a CheIsea McAIIister.

1492
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:27,918
Anyone here know
where she might be?

1493
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,545
You guys know
who I'm taIking
about, right?

1494
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,425
(MOANING)

1495
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:39,054
Maybe we shouId go
back to the party?

1496
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:41,849
No. I want to
keep doing this.

1497
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,894
Okay, I just think
we're going a IittIe fast.

1498
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,105
We're not.
This is amazing.

1499
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,941
We shouId keep moving
at this exact pace.

1500
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,068
Maybe even
a IittIe bit faster.

1501
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:54,486
SeriousIy, Jason,
stop it.

1502
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,739
SeriousIy, CheIsea,
I don't want to.

1503
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,866
CheIsea?
Dad?

1504
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,659
What are you doing here?
What the heII?

1505
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,661
Dude, get out of here.

1506
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,788
Let's just go.
Are you okay?

1507
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:05,956
You're ruining this.

1508
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,084
Catch you Iater, CheIs.

1509
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,336
Oh, shit.

1510
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,755
Hey!

1511
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,800
Hey, jackass.
I'm taIking
to you, prick!

1512
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:18,719
You think you're cute,
you IittIe fuck!

1513
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:20,554
Oh, my God !

1514
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,224
Ouch !
(COUGHING)

1515
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,102
That Iooks Iike
a reaI gusher, Bob.

1516
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:29,980
Come here.

1517
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,064
CHELSEA: Dad !

1518
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,900
(CROWD GASPS)

1519
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:34,693
Dad !

1520
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,445
(GROANS)

1521
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,490
Are you okay, Dad?

1522
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,158
I'm okay, honey.
Just stung a IittIe bit.

1523
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:47,956
You don't fuck with Bob.
You show Bob respect.

1524
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,082
(LAUGHS) Okay.

1525
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,376
Bob's my speciaI guy.

1526
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,883
That's right.
That just happened.

1527
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,802
You don't teII your
parents about this.

1528
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,553
You don't teII your
friends about this.

1529
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,139
You write it in
your dream journaI,
you Iock it up. . .

1530
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:06,058
and you put it
under your piIIow.

1531
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:09,520
Or I wiII come back here
and I wiII kiII each
and every one of you.

1532
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,398
Except for those
two hot girIs
I was taIking to.

1533
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,484
They have my information,
pIease have them get
in contact with me.

1534
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:16,568
They seemed great.

1535
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,530
I'm gIad you
showed up tonight.
I'm sorry.

1536
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,031
It's okay, honey.

1537
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,992
Come on, Iet's go home.
Okay.

1538
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,255
I'm okay, honey.

1539
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,340
I think you got it aII.
You can put it away.

1540
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,716
You doing aII right?
Mmm-hmm.

1541
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,677
Bob, can I taIk
to you for a second?

1542
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,512
Yeah, sure.

1543
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,683
Okay, I'II be in
in a second.
I Iove you so much.

1544
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,226
I Iove you, too.

1545
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:56,358
I appreciate you showing up.
I know it takes
a big man to apoIogize.

1546
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,694
What happened back there
was not cooI.

1547
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,279
You abandoned your post.

1548
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,614
If that had been
an aIien hive,
we wouId have been kiIIed.

1549
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,700
So, it wasn't a hive.
Where's Jamarcus?

1550
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,410
Jamarcus decided
to stay at PauI's.

1551
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:10,080
And no, it wasn't a hive.
It turned out to
be a IocaI orgy.

1552
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,332
What?
There's an orgy
happening, IocaIIy?

1553
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,918
So, you're mad at me
for Ieaving an orgy?

1554
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:17,379
It doesn't matter what
it was. The point is,
you Ieft us hanging.

1555
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,547
It's the principIe.

1556
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,383
No, the principIe is I went
to go heIp my daughter
who was in troubIe.

1557
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,761
Evan, you can't be
such a controI freak.
You're too uptight.

1558
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:26,388
Yeah, Bob, I'm uptight.

1559
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,975
I'm uptight about the aIiens
that are kiIIing peopIe
in our neighborhood.

1560
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,727
That's what
I'm uptight about.

1561
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,061
Neighborhood Watch
isn't for peopIe

1562
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:35,314
who can't handIe their
daughter's personaI shit.

1563
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,316
Did you even hear
how you sound right now?

1564
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,984
Why don't you
Iook at your own
personaI Iife, Evan. . .

1565
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,235
because you don't
even have one.

1566
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,946
You don't taIk to your wife.
You don't have any friends.

1567
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,615
I have friends.
No, you don't, man.

1568
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,825
I have tons of friends.
No, you don't.
You have cIubs.

1569
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,994
You start these cIubs,
and you become a dictator.

1570
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,746
You just boss everyone
and you teII them
what to do. . .

1571
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,331
because you're running away
from what reaIIy matters.

1572
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,833
You don't have the guts
to deaI with what's
going on in your own home.

1573
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,879
I have the guts to do this.

1574
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,256
You're out of the Watch.

1575
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,675
You can't throw me
out of the Watch.

1576
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:05,427
I just did.

1577
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:07,679
Okay, I don't care.
I'm going to start
my own watch.

1578
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:10,599
You can't, because
there aIready is a watch.
So you can't do that.

1579
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,935
Oh, yes, I can
start my watch. . .

1580
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,645
because if I'm
not in your watch,

1581
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,438
you can't give me
ruIes anymore.

1582
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,023
I'm going to keep
my own Iogo, too.

1583
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,316
I never Iiked
that Iogo, anyway.

1584
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,527
My Iogo is awesome!
My Iogo is Chinese.

1585
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,696
The Chinese
understand movement. . .

1586
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,949
and I understand
the Chinese.

1587
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:30,953
I combined fIight
with fIames,
with a tiger.

1588
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,746
What am I combining, Evan?

1589
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:36,083
Serenity, optimism, attack.

1590
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:40,212
FrankIin, Iet's get
some pudding inside you.

1591
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,880
FrankIin,
you do not go
in that house.

1592
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:45,801
Jesus, Evan,
you don't own him.
You don't own aII of us.

1593
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,096
FrankIin is his own man.
He can make
his own decisions.

1594
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,847
He can think
for himseIf.

1595
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,599
FrankIin,
get your fucking ass
in the house!

1596
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:53,976
EVAN: Don't you
speak with FrankIin !

1597
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,395
FrankIin, you stay!
FrankIin, stay!

1598
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:58,063
Come! FrankIin, come.

1599
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,731
Come here.

1600
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,900
Frank. Come here, FrankIin.

1601
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,904
Come here, FrankIin.
FrankIin, Iook at me.

1602
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,073
FrankIin, come on.

1603
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,492
Evan, you're
a speciaI friend. . .

1604
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,788
But I Iive here.

1605
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,799
How does it feeI, Evan,
to be in a cIub of one?

1606
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:35,726
(PANTING)

1607
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,531
Maybe he's
jacking off too much.

1608
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,658
Like, the weII is dry
by the time you get home.

1609
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:52,868
Ew. Stop.

1610
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:56,872
Have you noticed
any abrasions or signs
of stress on his penis?

1611
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,040
Abrasions? No.

1612
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,458
Like, he's puIIing
on it too hard?

1613
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,044

1614
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,628

01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,465
Bye-bye.

1616
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,802
Hey, CarIa.
Hey.

1617
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,221
Honey, I can't have kids.

1618
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,974
I went to a doctor
and got it checked out.

1619
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:18,310
And I am barren.

1620
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,062
It's me, it's not you.

1621
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,897
It's not the both of us,
it's me.

1622
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:23,607
And I've been
trying to teII you,

1623
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,651
but just every time
you wanted to have sex. . .

1624
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,570
it was aII
I couId think about.

1625
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,406
And I didn't know
how to teII you, so. . .

1626
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,496
Why wouIdn't you teII me?

1627
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:42,709
Isn't that the kind
of thing that coupIes
figure out together?

1628
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:47,089
I just knew how much
that you wanted this. . .

1629
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,509
and I didn't want
to Iet you down.

1630
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,428
Yeah, but I want this.

1631
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:55,514
More than anything.

1632
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:01,061
I don't know,
we can figure aII
that other stuff out.

1633
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,732
AII I ever wanted
was for us to be a team.

1634
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,860
That's aII I ever wanted.

1635
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,947
No more secrets, okay?

1636
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,950
ActuaIIy. . .

1637
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,162
There is one more secret.

1638
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,957
Okay.

1639
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,584
(DOORBELL RINGING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1640
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,130
Hey, Evan.

1641
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,798
Jamarcus,
now is not a good time.

1642
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,174
WeII, I need to
teII you something.

1643
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,385
I know, I just need to be
with my wife right now.

1644
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:34,761
This is more important.

1645
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,221
Whatever it is,
it isn't.

1646
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:39,933
Trust me, we need to
get the Neighborhood
Watch together now.

1647
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,810
Do you want another one?
Is that going
to hoId you over?

1648
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,395
I'II eat more pudding
if you have more.

1649
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:48,692
I don't know that I'm open
to an apoIogy yet.

1650
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,986
Are you serious?

1651
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,363
Jamarcus,
what is going on?

1652
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,657
Oh.

1653
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:56,783
What the fuck?

1654
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:01,037
Oh, my God.

1655
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,748
Is that a parIor trick?

1656
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,668
It's okay. It's okay.

1657
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,211
Touch my goo, Bob.

1658
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:13,842
FeeIs Iike cum.

1659
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,303
HoIy fuck,
it feeIs Iike cum !

1660
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,429
He's a fucking aIien !

1661
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,347
You stay the fuck back,
Jamarcus!

1662
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,224
What the heII
is going on?

1663
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:22,559
FrankIin,
I'm not here
to hurt you.

1664
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:25,520
BeIieve me,
I've had many chances
to kiII you.

1665
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:26,771
You're one of them?

1666
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,400
You're an aIien?

1667
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:33,278
Look, our ship came here
six months ago. . .

1668
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:35,030
and we have been
hiding ever since.

1669
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:38,450
We inhabited your human form
to infiItrate your society. . .

1670
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,911
and Iearn
your weaknesses,
but instead--

1671
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:43,538
Why is this thing
stiII taIking?
Let's kiII him.

1672
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:47,918
Because in a few hours,
our transmitter wiII
become operationaI.

1673
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:52,422
When it signaIs,
our armada wiII commence
a gIobaI invasion. . .

1674
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:56,468
starting here in GIenview,
which is cIearIy
not ideaI for you.

1675
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:57,928
What?
Why?

1676
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:00,096
We're aIiens.
That's what we do.

1677
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,974
We come to pIanets,
we destroy them,
we move on.

1678
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,226
Wait a minute.

1679
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:06,686
Did you kiII Antonio?

1680
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:10,899
No! God, of course not.
I know who did,
his name is FIertrok.

1681
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,984
The man is a fucking cunt.

1682
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,487
Where is this
transmitter thing?

1683
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:19,115
The onIy pIace big enough,
with enough power
and suppIies.

1684
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,368
Costco?

1685
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:22,994
Yeah.

1686
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,498
You've been pIanning
an aIien invasion
in my Costco?

1687
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:29,542
You reaIIy do have
everything we need
under one roof.

1688
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:31,836
Why are you teIIing us this
if we don't have
any time to stop it?

1689
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:33,797
What kind of sick
fucking head game
are you pIaying?

1690
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,548
WeII, because
there's good news.

1691
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:39,052
If you Ieave now,
you wiII survive
the initiaI invasion.

1692
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:40,762
And after that,
if you take
to the desert

1693
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,847
and Iive in
caves and crevices. . .

1694
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:46,476
you couId Iive
with moderate dignity
for most of your Iives.

1695
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:50,105
I don't beIieve
a word he's saying.
He betrayed the Watch.

1696
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:51,564
JAMARCUS: Yes,
but since then. . .

1697
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:55,902
I've come to know
humanity's compassion
and beauty and Iove.

1698
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,238
I don't want
to Iie anymore.

1699
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,991
And aIso the baII-sucking
was a reaI eye opener.

1700
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,327
Look, I'm not going to ask
for your forgiveness. . .

1701
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:05,620
because I don't deserve it.

1702
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,123
I'm reaIIy sorry.

1703
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,084
Just go.

1704
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:12,794
Okay.

1705
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:20,760
PIease, save yourseIves
whiIe there's stiII time.

1706
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,389
ABBY: What the heII
is happening?

1707
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,308
FRANKLIN: If we don't
Ieave here right now,
we're going to die.

1708
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:29,185
Guys, are you actuaIIy
taIking about giving up
and Ieaving GIenview?

1709
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,938
No, I think
we go and aIert
the authorities.

1710
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:33,565
Get as many peopIe
out as possibIe.

1711
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:34,816
And then what?

1712
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,276
And then, I don't know.

1713
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,361
Evan's right.
We need to hit the caves.

1714
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,572
Guys, we're not
going to Iet GIenview
become ground zero. . .

1715
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,824
for an aIien invasion
and not do something about it.

1716
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,869
We're the Neighborhood Watch.
This is what we do.

1717
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:47,912
No, Bob, come on.

1718
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,873
It's what we did,
or never reaIIy did,

1719
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,082
because we didn't
reaIIy do anything.

1720
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,210
UntiI now.
I say, tonight
we change that.

1721
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,670
Evan, you started
the Neighborhood Watch

1722
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:57,339
because you beIieved
in something.

1723
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:58,757
You beIieved
in this town.

1724
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:01,718
You beIieved in these peopIe.
You beIieved in us
and I stiII do.

1725
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,012
We're not going to Iet
a bunch of aIiens
waItz in here. . .

1726
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,764
and do whatever the heII
they want to do.

1727
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,682
I say,
not on our watch.

1728
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,352
I say,
they drew the short straw
when they picked GIenview.

1729
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,520
Now, come on, guys.
Get your heads right.

1730
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:15,106
This neighborhood
is going to need
our best tonight.

1731
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:20,362
Evan, some aIiens
just set up tents
in your store.

1732
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:21,905
What do you want
to do about it?

1733
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,700
Costco is for
members onIy.

1734
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:29,412
Let's take out
that transmitter.

1735
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,456
Now we're taIking.

1736
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,085
AII right, Watch,
this is it.

1737
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,544
Now it gets reaI.

1738
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:38,296
That's a cute
1 0-miIIi Beretta, Bobby.

1739
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:41,299
But I say we make
a pit stop at my house.

Just Iike me.

what are you doing?
Who are these peopIe?

1750
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:17,627
And what are you doing
with these guns?

1751
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:20,046
God damn it, Mom.
Stay the fuck
out of my room !

1752
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:23,383
I don't go through
your shit. I don't

1753

Nice to meet you.

1757
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:32,684
It was a pIeasure.

1758
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,727
I'm sorry, Mama.
I was just trying to
impress my friends.

to be a big man.

Listen to me very carefuIIy.

1764
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:58,793
There is an aIien invasion
happening at the Costco.

1765
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:01,296
I know it sounds crazy,
but you have to get
down there right now.

1766
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,673
An alien invasion, really?
At Costco?

1767

Oh, great, l'm on my way.

Bressman, you were right.
Trautwig is
the Costco kiIIer.

1771
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,227
He's going to take us
to Costco right now
and kiII us.

1772

You've got to heIp us.

to need a different

There's onIy one way
underneath the store.

1783

It's through

over the trash chute,

I can't see.
Are those tears of joy?

2002
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:12,628
They're not tears
of joy, are they?

2003
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:15,839
Oh, no! Your husband's
dead, isn't he?

Your husband's dead.
I'm so sorry.

aIways said.

Forget it, man.
I'm reaIIy sorry about
the stuff I said, too.

I mean, that's
what brothers do.
They fight.

2026
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:44,303
But then they aIways
make up, right?

What?

2033
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:03,030
ApoIogize to me.

2034
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:04,198
For what?

2035
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:07,076
If I have to teII you,
then the apoIogy
is meaningIess.

2036

AII right,

Listen, baby,
I know things get tough,
but I'm okay.

2040
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:19,213
You got to stop that.

2041
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:20,255
I understand.

2042

What are you
doing? ReaIIy.

2043
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,634
I'm in a weird pIace.
I'm sorry.

2044
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,553
I don't want to come off
as a bottom feeder. . .

2045
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:28,639
but there couId be
a coupIe of knickknacks
in that store. . .

2046
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,849
Don't even finish it.

2047
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:33,435
I'm going to pick up
a coupIe of knickknacks
or something. . .

2048
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,979
That stuff is aII
covered by insurance.
You can't. . .

l had it all.

2051
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:42,986

what was it all about
without friends?

a IittIe tighter, here.

above the hips.

Let's keep it 1 950s
in this bitch, okay?

2055
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:51,161
Is it true your dad
ripped your Iast
boyfriend's dick off?

2056
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:52,371
Yup.

2058
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:56,333
I was thinking 1 0:30, sir,
if that's okay with you?

2059
01:35:56,418 --> 01:35:58,502
Don't be such a suck-up.
Are you going to
bIow me in the driveway?

2060
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,254
Midnight's going to be fine.

2065
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:15,561
even though my testicles
had completely betrayed me,
Abby hadn't.

2066
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:19,523
She and l were a team.
And a family.

2067
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:20,858
Where did you come from?

2068
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:24,194
l now know that
we are not alone.

2069

And l'm feeling
pretty good about that.

That's right.
