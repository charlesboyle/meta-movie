One!

Two!

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,447

<i>My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

22

27
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,903
<i>as the head of my
own brokerage firm,</i>

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,656
<i>I made $49 million,</i>

29
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,182
<i>which really pissed me off because it
was three shy of a million a week.</i>

30
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,416
<i>No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,</i>

31
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,145
<i>like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
Not red.</i>

32

<i>Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.</i>

52
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,120
Okay.

53
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,313
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,916
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,934
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

56
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,394
Relax!

57
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,355
Just relax.

58
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,364
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

59
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,081
Good job.

60
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,748
You get in there safe, all right?

61
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,704
Till the next time, brother.

62
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,251
Till next time.

63
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,155
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

64
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:04,729
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

65
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,604
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

66
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,499
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times
a day for my "back pain,"

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,398
Adderall to stay focused,

68
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,379
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,450
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

70
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,989
because it's awesome.

71
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,111
Good morning, Nathan.

72
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,454
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

73
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,798
there is one that is
my absolute favorite.

74
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,091
You see,

75
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,295
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

76
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,405
Able to conquer the world,

77
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,133
and eviscerate your enemies.

78
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,302
Ah!

79
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,563
And I'm not talking about this.

80
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,732
I'm talking about this.

81
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,670
<i>See, money doesn't just
buy you a better life,</i>

82
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,215
<i>better food, better
cars, better pussy.</i>

83
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,592
<i>It also makes you a better person.</i>

84
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,385
<i>You can give generously
to the church</i>

85
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,304
<i>or political party of your choice.</i>

86
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,954
<i>You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.</i>

87
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,499
<i>I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.</i>

88
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,983
<i>I'm 22 years old, newly married,</i>

89
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,507
<i>and already a
money-crazed little shit.</i>

90
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,779
<i>So what do I do?</i>

91
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,280
<i>I go to the one place on Earth</i>

92
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,679
<i>that befit my
high-minded ambitions.</i>

93
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,970
I love you.

94
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,484
<i>You are lower than pond scum.</i>

95
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,491
You got a problem with that,

96
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,280
Jordan?

97
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,582
No. No problem at all.

98
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,183
Good. Because that is what you are.

99
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,501
Pond scum.

100
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,144
Your job is connector,

101
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,023
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

102
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,985
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

103
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,028
And until you pass your Series 7,

104
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,322
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

105
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,549
Sit!

106
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,120
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

107
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,475
The other guy you'll be working
for, he made over a million.

108
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,458
<i>A million dollars?</i>

109
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,062
<i>I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.</i>

110
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,278
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,238
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

112
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,862
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

113
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,637
Smile and dial.

114
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,116
And don't pick up your
fucking head until 1:00.

115
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,725
Hey, fuck him.

116
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,454
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

117
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,921
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

118
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,629
Now did you really pitch a stock
in your job interview?

119
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,586
I had to do something to stand out.
Right, sir?

120
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,089
I fucking love that.

121
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,640
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,618
We don't start dialing at 9:30

123
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,537
because our clients are
already answering the phone.

124
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,165
Three. Two. One.

125
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,267
Let's fuck!

126
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,003
<i>You want to know
what money sounds like?</i>

127
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,047
<i>Go to a trading floor
on Wall Street.</i>

128
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,590
<i>"Fuck" this, "shit" that.</i>

129
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,091
<i>"Cunt, " "cock," "asshole. "</i>

130
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,385
<i>I couldn't believe how these
guys talked to each other.</i>

131
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,762
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

132
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,536
<i>I was hooked in seconds.</i>

133
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,618
<i>It was like mainlining adrenaline.</i>

134
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,124
Yeah. Fuckface, look at where
the stock's at today, huh?

135
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,790
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

136
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,376
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

137
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,213
You are such a fucking
douchebag, Hanna.

138
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,199
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

139
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,928
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

140
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,305
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

141
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,807
Done!

142
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,209
Time to paint the tape. Whoo!

143
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,689
2,000. Microsoft.
Going in the hole!

144
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,197
Come on.

145
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,989
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

146
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,720
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.

147
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,993
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

148
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,206
Sold!

149
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,681
Yeah.

150
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,102
Tootski?

151
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,195
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

152
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,198
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

153
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,659
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

154
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,261
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

155
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,013
You know howl like them.
Straight up.

156
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,724
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

157
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,183
you're gonna bring us two more.

158
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,520
Then two more after that
every five minutes

159
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,715
until one of us
passes the fuck out.

160
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,383
Excellent strategy, sir.

161
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,261
I'm good with water for now.

162
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,720
Thank you.

163
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,716
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

164
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,518
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,811
Mr. Hanna?

166
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,998
You're able to do
drugs during the day

167
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,522
and then still function,
still do your job?

168
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,961
How the fuck else would
you do this job?

169
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,905
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

170
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,695
Right.

171
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,801
Well, I got to say,
I'm incredibly excited

172
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,075
to be a part of your firm.
I mean...

173
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,681
The clients you have
are absolutely...

174
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,079
Fuck the clients.

175
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,917
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

176
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,127
You got a girlfriend?

177
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,815
I'm married. I have a wife.

178
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,964
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

179
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,360
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

180
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,804
Think about Teresa.

181
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,072
Name of the game.

182
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,928
Move the money from your client's
pocket into your pocket.

183
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,118
Right.

184
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,870
But if you make your clients money
at the same time,

185
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,269
it's advantageous to
everyone. Correct?

186
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,066
No.

187
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,895
Number one rule of Wall Street.

188
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,068
Nobody...

189
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,465
I don't care if you're Warren
Buffett or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

190
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,176
Nobody knows if a
stock is gonna go up,

191
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,178
down, sideways,
or in fucking circles.

192
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,347
- Least of all stockbrokers, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

193
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,891
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

194
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,040
Uh. Fugayzi. It's a fake.

195
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,896
Fugayzi, fugazi, it's a whazy,
it's a woozy, it's...

196
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,357
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

197
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,359
It's never landed. It is no matter.

198
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,819
It's not on the elemental chart.

199
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,904
It's not fucking real.

200
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,302
- Right?
- Right.

201
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,262
- Stay with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

202
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,019
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

203
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,120
No.

204
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,164
So if you got a client
who bought stock at 8

205
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,688
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

206
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,127
He wants to cash in, liquidate,

207
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,878
take his fucking
money and run home.

208
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,902
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

209
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,866
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

210
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,217
No. What do you do?

211
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,070
You get another brilliant idea.

212
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,762
A special idea.

213
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,265
Another "situation." Another stock

214
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,392
to reinvest his
earnings and then some.

215
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,712
And he will, every single time.

216
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,751
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

217
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,858
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

218
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,819
Meanwhile,
he thinks he's getting shit rich,

219
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,797
which he is, on paper.

220
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,739
But you and me, the brokers,

221
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,616
we're taking home cold hard cash

222
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,970
via commission, motherfucker.

223
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,645
Right.

224
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,915
That's incredible, sir.

225
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,393
I can't tell you how excited I am.

226
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,690
You should be.

227
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,566
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

228
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,024
First of all...

229
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,112
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,829
Do you jerk off?

231
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,807
Do I... Do I jerk off?

232
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,127
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

233
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,541
How many times a week?

234
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,439
Like, um, three or four.

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,773
Three or four times, maybe five.

236
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,816
Gotta pump those numbers up.

237
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,152
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

238
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,053
I myself, I jerk off
at least twice a day.

239
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,782
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

240
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,227
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

241
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,846
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

242
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,516
I want to. That's not why I do it.

243
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,855
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

244
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,461
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

245
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,505
All day long,
decimal points, high frequencies.

246
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,607
Bang, bang, bang.

247
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,152
Fucking digits.

248
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,429
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

249
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,782
- All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

250
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,140
It kind of wigs some people out.

251
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,266
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right.

252
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,643
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

253
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,685
Mmm-hmm.

254
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,520
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

255
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,813
Done.

256
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,398
This is not a tip, this
is a prescription.

257
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,625
- Trust me.
- Mmm-hmm.

258
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,236
If you don't, you will
fall out of balance,

259
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,446
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

260
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,822
Or worse yet,

261
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,641
I've seen this happen, implode.

262
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,743
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

263
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,953
No. No, you don't.

264
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,246
I'm in it for the
long run, you know?

265
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,849
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,166
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

267
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,251
When you get really good at it,

268
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,276
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

269
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:40,634
Second key to success
in this racket

270
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,969
is this little baby right here.

271
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,447
It's called cocaine.

272
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,930
Right.

273
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,890
It'll keep you sharp
between the ears.

274
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,959
It'll also help your
fingers dial faster.

275
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,203
And guess what?

276
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,122
That's good for me.

277
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,627
Yes, sir.

278
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,171
Revolutions. You follow?

279
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,293
Revolutions.

280
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,569
Keep the clients on
the Ferris wheel.

281
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,198
And it goes. The park
is open 24/7, 365,

282
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,223
every decade, every
goddamn century.

283
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,641
That's it.

284
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,518
The name of the game.

285
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,146
Halkidiki?

286
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,852
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

287
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,656
Come on.

288
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,541
We're the common denominator.

289
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,675
Ah.

290
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,012
Ah.

291
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,965
Keep it up for me.

292
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,949
<i>You've seen the echo</i>

293
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,643
<i>And the money comes in</i>

294
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,120
<i>The parade comes to town</i>

295
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,955
<i>Going down Broadway</i>

296
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,623
<i>It's a one-way street</i>

297
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,021
<i>Whichever way I go</i>

298
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,255
<i>The next six months,</i>

299
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,674
<i>I got to know the ins and outs
of Wall Street.</i>

300
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,370
<i>Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.</i>

301
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,208
Oh!

302
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,369
Oh, fuckers.

303
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,714
Oh!

304
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,446
<i>Then I was a licensed
broker at last,</i>

305
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,531
<i>ready to make my fortune.</i>

306
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:31,229
<i>My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.</i>

307
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,821
I have Exxon at 86
1/4 six months ago.

308
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,256
Today it is trading at 36 1/2.

309
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,529
Mr...

310
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,889
<i>They called it Black Monday.</i>

311
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,182
<i>No shit.</i>

312
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:56,311
<i>By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.</i>

313
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,256
<i>The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.</i>

314
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,732
I know your family, you know mine.

315
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,819
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

316
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,237
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

317
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,571
Our market's solid.

318
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,299
This is not something
that you want to sell.

319
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,097
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

320
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,243
I think you're making
a big mistake.

321
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,828
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

322
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,538
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

323
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,956
A lot of people are
gonna be calling you,

324
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,149
trying to get your dirty laundry.

325
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,417
We don't know what's going on here.

326
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,770
I know. I know.

327
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,198
Holy

328
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,118
fucking shit!

329
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,520
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

330
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,064
<i>My first shitty day as a broker.</i>

331
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,525
<i>Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,</i>

332
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:48,382
<i>an institution since
1899, closed its doors.</i>

333
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,866
<i>Wall Street had swallowed me up</i>

334
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,345
<i>and shit me right back out again.</i>

335
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,999
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,584
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

337
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,751
If we needed to, I'm saying...

338
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,378
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

339
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,607
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

340
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,048
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

341
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,249
You're gonna be a millionaire.

342
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,737
That's right. Okay?
Just let me look.

343
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,034
We'll find something.

344
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,763
- How about this?
- What?

345
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,308
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

346
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,626
Stock boy. What do you think?

347
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,207
You're not gonna
work at that place.

348
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,312
Yeah, but, you know,
you start off...

349
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,480
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

350
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,564
- if you go there.
- I know.

351
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,815
It's sales. You work your way up,

352
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,025
you'll be a general manager.

353
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,735
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

354
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,258
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

355
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,132
You understand that nobody's
hiring stockbrokers right now?

356
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,509
You understand that?

357
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,180
Okay?

358
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,186
Ah. This place is.

359
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,477
- What?
- What's that say?

360
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,853
"Stockbrokers."

361
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,796
In Long Island?
Stockbrokers in Long Island?

362
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,023
Yeah.

363
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,193
<i>It's in Long Island. So what?</i>

364
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:12,011
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for Investor's Center.

365
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,930
What's that? You want to invest?

366
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,785
No. Investor's Center.

367
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,058
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

368
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,747
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

369
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,790
Oh.

370
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,458
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

371
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,402
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

372
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,063
I'm Jordan Belfort.

373
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,407
I'm the broker from Rothschild
in New York.

374
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,241
Yes, yeah. Have a seat.
How are you?

375
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,801
We had a conversation...

376
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,135
We spoke on the phone
earlier, right?

377
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,554
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

378
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,656
Yeah.

379
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,788
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

380
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,686
It's 3 cents a share, that's $3!

381
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,255
You cheap fuck!

382
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,189
So, uh...

383
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,918
So where are your Quotrons here?

384
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,194
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

385
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,571
No, no.
We don't even need computers here.

386
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,390
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

387
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,266
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

388
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,201
You know, uh, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

389
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,474
they don't have enough capital?

390
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,662
Their shares trade here.

391
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,436
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

392
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,417
This one, uh, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

393
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,876
Or Aerotyne...

394
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,445
Aerotyne, yeah.

395
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,156
Aero... Aerotyne...

396
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,590
Aerotyne. Yeah.

397
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,799
Very hot stock right now.

398
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,883
Oh, yeah?

399
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,176
They're just a couple of brothers
that are making

400
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,595
radar detectors out
of their garage.

401
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,679
They're out in Dubuque.

402
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,014
Maybe it's microwaves.
I'm not sure.

403
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,515
But you call the
company's main line,

404
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,434
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

405
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,436
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

406
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,557
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

407
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,962
Six cents a share?

408
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,795
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

409
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,008
Well, I mean...

410
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,404
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

411
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,507
Postmen, there's always postmen.

412
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,491
Uh, plumbers. Um...

413
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,035
They see our ads in
the back of, uh,

414
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,620
<i>Hustler and Popular Mechanics.</i>

415
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,565
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

416
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,832
<i>- Hustler?</i>
- Yeah.

417
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,125
You know, those girlie magazines.

418
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,694
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

419
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,878
- A lot.
- Yeah.

420
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,588
We're helping them finance houses,

421
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,548
we're helping them buy
their wife a diamond ring...

422
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,716
A boat maybe.

423
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,661
Is this... Is this stuff
regulated or are you guys...

424
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,870
What are you doing here?

425
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,948
Uh...

426
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,749
Sort of.

427
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,993
Sort of?

428
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,229
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

429
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,606
Yeah. And that's
the point, that's...

430
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,774
What's your name again?

431
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,172
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

432
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,132
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

433
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,257
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

434
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,224
Pink sheets, it's 50.

435
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,388
It's 50%?

436
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,602
50% commission?

437
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,191
- Yup.
- For what?

438
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,568
It's our markup for our services.

439
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,379
And so if I... If I...

440
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,610
if I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

441
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,135
If you sell $10,000
worth of this stock,

442
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,409
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

443
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,849
And I hope it happens.

444
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,946
<i>Hello, John,
how are you doing today?</i>

445
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,606
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

446
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,400
requesting information
on penny stocks

447
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,527
that had huge upside potential

448
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,278
with very little downside risk.

449
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,280
- Does that ring a bell?
<i>- Yeah, I may have sent something.</i>

450
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,492
Okay, great. The reason for
the call today, John, is,

451
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,221
something just came
across my desk, John.

452
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,621
It is perhaps the best thing

453
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,123
I've seen in the last six months.

454
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,999
If you have 60 seconds,
I'd like to share

455
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,292
the idea with you.
You got a minute?

456
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,419
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i>

457
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,963
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

458
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,318
It is a cutting edge high-tech firm
out of the Midwest

459
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,385
<i>awaiting imminent patent approval</i>

460
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,971
on the next generation
of radar detectors

461
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:27,578
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

462
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,977
Right now, John,

463
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,438
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

464
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,815
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

465
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,192
it could go a heck of
a lot higher than that.

466
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,237
Your profit on a mere
$6,000 investment

467
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,262
would be upwards of $60,000!

468
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,867
<i>Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.</i>

469
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,535
Exactly.
You could pay off your mortgage.

470
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,120
<i>This stock will pay off my house?</i>

471
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,997
John, one thing I can promise you,

472
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,315
even in this market,

473
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,125
is that I never ask my clients

474
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,603
to judge me on my winners.

475
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,573
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

476
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,215
And in the case of Aerotyne,

477
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,926
based on every technical
factor out there, John,

478
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,156
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

479
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,099
<i>Okay, let's do it. I'll do 4 grand.</i>

480
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,419
$4,000? That'd be
40,000 shares, John.

481
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,936
Let me lock in that trade right now

482
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,313
and get back to you
with my secretary

483
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,315
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

484
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,668
<i>- Yeah, sounds good.</i>
- Great.

485
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,901
Hey, John.

486
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,549
Thank you for your
vote of confidence.

487
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,529
And welcome to the
Investor's Center.

488
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,677
<i>Yeah, thanks a lot, man.</i>

489
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,099
Bye-bye.

490
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,162
How'd you fucking do that?

491
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,917
<i>Just like that, I made 2 grand.</i>

492
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,817
<i>The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.</i>

493
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,611
Great! Even better!

494
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,716
<i>I was selling garbage
to garbage men</i>

495
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,319
<i>and making cash hand over fist.</i>

496
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,074
The only problem you're gonna
have is that you didn't buy more.

497
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,972
Boom shocka locka!

498
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,016
<i>So I was selling them shit.</i>

499
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>But the way I looked at it, their
money was better off in my pocket.</i>

500
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,464
<i>I knew how to spend it better.</i>

501
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,213
<i>Excuse me.
Is that your car in the lot?</i>

502
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,717
Yeah.

503
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,754
<i>- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.</i>

504
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,009
Donnie Azoff.

505
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,155
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

506
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,517
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

507
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,408
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

508
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,182
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

509
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,079
I think we live in
the same building.

510
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,247
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

511
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,066
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

512
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,250
Fourth floor.

513
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,194
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

514
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,193
What do you do, bro?

515
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,196
What do you mean, what do I do?

516
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,467
For work, what do you do?

517
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,694
I'm a stockbroker.

518
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,576
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

519
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,244
Children's furniture.

520
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,598
Oh, good for you.

521
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,042
It's all right.

522
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,620
You make a lot of money?

523
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,755
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

524
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,089
I'm trying to put it together.

525
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,566
You got your fucking nice car,

526
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,109
we live in the same
building. I just...

527
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,804
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

528
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,683
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

529
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,560
Get the fuck...

530
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,390
Get the fuck out of here.

531
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,767
No, I'm serious.

532
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,060
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

533
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,225
Seriously,
how much money do you make?

534
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,565
I told you. $70,000.

535
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,234
Well, technically, $72,000.

536
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,240
Last month. Something like that.

537
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,301
You made 72 grand in one month?

538
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,574
Yeah.

539
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,291
I'll tell you what.

540
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,477
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

541
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,831
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

542
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,305
<i>Hey, Paulie, what's up?</i>

543
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,721
No, yeah, yeah.
No, everything's fine.

544
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,219
Hey, listen, I quit.

545
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,179
<i>And he did quit his job.</i>

546
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,454
<i>Which I thought was a little weird.</i>

547
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,228
<i>I mean, I just met
this fucking guy.</i>

548
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,188
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

549
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,584
<i>There were other
things about him, too.</i>

550
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,794
<i>Like his phosphorescent
white teeth.</i>

551
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,046
wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

552
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,298
<i>The fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lenses</i>

553
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,151
<i>just to look more WASP-y.</i>

554
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,287
<i>And then, there were these rumors.</i>

555
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,014
I heard some stupid shit.
I don't know.

556
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,413
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

557
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,460
- it's stupid.
- Shit with me?

558
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,687
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

559
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,211
I don't even listen
to it half the time.

560
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,876
What are they saying?

561
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,362
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

562
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,696
I don't even listen to it.

563
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,346
Oh, bro, it's not like that.

564
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,684
It's not like that.

565
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,687
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

566
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,664
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

567
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,582
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

568
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,186
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

569
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,362
Is she like a first
cousin, or is she...

570
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,546
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

571
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,570
Her... Her father

572
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,490
is the brother of my mom.

573
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,203
It's not like, what... You know.

574
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,538
Look, we grew up together.

575
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,224
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

576
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,059
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

577
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,753
And I'm not gonna let someone...

578
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,729
You know, one of these
assholes fuck my cousin,

579
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,815
so, you know, I used
the cousin thing

580
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,293
as like an in with her.

581
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,860
I'm not gonna let someone
else fuck my cousin.

582
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,612
You know,
if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,

583
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,572
it's gonna be me, out of respect.
You know?

584
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,740
No, I get it. Yeah.

585
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,060
I mean, you're not afraid of
like the whole kid thing, right?

586
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,327
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

587
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,645
No. We have two kids.

588
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,163
And they're... I mean...

589
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,833
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

590
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,028
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

591
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,029
But there's a big
chance, right, if...

592
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,423
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

593
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:12,028
60 to 65% chance the kid's gonna
be fucking retarded or whatever.

594
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,244
That'd scare the shit
out of me, buddy.

595
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,638
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

596
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,432
whether you're fucking
cousins or not.

597
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,268
What if something
like that happened?

598
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,936
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

599
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,356
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

600
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,108
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

601
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,382
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

602
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,879
You know?

603
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,160
You're completely fucking with me.

604
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,728
That's horrible.
You're not gonna...

605
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,416
You look like you've... No.

606
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,334
We would take it to,
like, an institution or somewhere

607
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,586
that's handled to, like, you know,

608
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,234
raise the kid or whatever.

609
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,840
You know what? If you're
happy, God bless you, buddy.

610
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,008
No, I'm not fucking happy.

611
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,237
No one who's married
is fucking happy.

612
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,905
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, buddy.

613
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,181
Listen, I'm really, you know...

614
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,580
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

615
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,851
I'm really enjoying it.

616
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,352
I'm really happy with
what you're doing.

617
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,501
Actually, I got you
a little present.

618
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,231
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

619
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,584
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

620
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,850
Yeah. It's in the back though.

621
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,425
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

622
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,806
Like it's wrapped up or something?

623
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,365
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

624
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,575
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

625
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,144
Let's fucking go. Come on.

626
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,329
Your turn.

627
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,413
I'm not fucking doing this.

628
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,561
You're out of your fucking mind.

629
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,583
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

630
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,668
No one's fucking here, bro.

631
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,816
Get the fuck...

632
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,671
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

633
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,839
I'm not fucking doing it.

634
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,675
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

635
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,120
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

636
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,114
Fucking nut job.

637
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,896
Wow!

638
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,649
Wow.

639
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,697
Let's go run, huh?

640
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,903
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

641
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,717
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

642
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,288
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

643
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,828
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

644
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,960
Let's fucking run! Go!

645
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,394
Go, go, go, go!

646
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,856
<i>You've reached
Frank's Best Auto Body.</i>

647
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,399
<i>We're closed right now.</i>

648
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,502
<i>So please leave us a message.</i>

649
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,278
<i>Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

650
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,739
<i>My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.</i>

651
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,325
<i>Donnie and I were
going out on our own.</i>

652
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,744
<i>And the first thing
we needed was brokers.</i>

653
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,746
<i>Guys with sales experience.</i>

654
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,748
<i>So I recruited some
of my hometown boys.</i>

655
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,792
<i>Sea Otter, who sold meat</i>

656
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,002
<i>and weed.</i>

657
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,296
<i>Chester, who sold tires</i>

658
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,463
<i>and weed.</i>

659
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,408
<i>And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.</i>

660
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,781
<i>Mostly weed.</i>

661
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,409
Can you bring me some ketchup?
Okay?

662
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,889
<i>This is Brad.</i>

663
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,640
<i>And Brad's the guy
I really wanted.</i>

664
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,975
<i>But he didn't go along with us.</i>

665
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,603
<i>He was already making so much
money selling Quaaludes,</i>

666
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,439
<i>he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.</i>

667
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,607
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

668
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,649
Yeah, man, of course.

669
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,610
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

670
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,986
Let 'em watch.

671
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,930
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

672
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:23,018
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

673
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,264
Why don't you bring me a pair of her
panties next time you come through.

674
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,183
Yeah, man. She said she don't
want to talk to you anymore, man.

675
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,614
Get the fuck out of here.

676
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,736
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

677
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,822
Ma!

678
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,483
You listening?
It's easier than you think.

679
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,967
Every person you're
on the phone with,

680
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,595
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

681
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,804
They all want something
for nothing.

682
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,390
There was this one time that I was
selling pot to this Amish dude.

683
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,850
You know those guys
who got like the beard

684
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,999
with like no mustache
or some bullshit?

685
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,924
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

686
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,524
I don't understand.

687
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,797
What's that
got to do with anything?

688
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,758
What the fuck are
you talking about?

689
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,696
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

690
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,926
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

691
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,470
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

692
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,829
What the fuck are
you talking about?

693
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,997
Yeah, like Buddhists.

694
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,040
They don't give a shit about money.

695
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,125
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

696
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,961
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

697
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,420
I'm talking about normal people,

698
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,797
working-class, everyday people.

699
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,799
Everyone wants to
get rich. Am I crazy?

700
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,175
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

701
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,119
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

702
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,471
Can we get some ketchup, please?

703
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,931
Do you guys not want to make money?

704
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,724
I want to make some money.

705
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,142
I want to make some
fucking money, okay.

706
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,460
I can sell anything.

707
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,521
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

708
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,522
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

709
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,463
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

710
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,151
Sell me this fucking
pen right here.

711
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,903
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

712
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,176
Sell me the pen.

713
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,966
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

714
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,431
Brad, show them how
it's done. Boom.

715
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,974
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

716
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,621
You want me to sell
this fucking pen?

717
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,975
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

718
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,208
Why don't you do me a favor.

719
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,889
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

720
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,086
I don't have a pen.

721
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,155
Exactly. Supply and
demand, my friend.

722
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,298
Holy shit.

723
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,590
See what I'm saying?
He's creating urgency.

724
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,009
Get them to want to buy the stock.

725
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,885
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

726
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,238
And that's the thing.

727
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,990
All nuns are lesbians.

728
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,849
What the fuck are you
talking about, Otter?

729
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,475
Think about it.
They can't keep a dude

730
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,727
so they're gonna start
fucking chicks.

731
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,001
Four fucking times,
Kimmie! Four times.

732
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,480
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

733
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,924
Now she runs.

734
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,885
<i>But look. I knew these
guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.</i>

735
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,570
<i>Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,</i>

736
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,864
<i>took five years to
finish high school.</i>

737
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,699
<i>Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,</i>

738
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,892
<i>didn't even graduate.</i>

739
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,077
<i>Chester Ming, the
depraved Chinaman,</i>

740
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,226
<i>thought jujitsu was in Israel.</i>

741
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,749
<i>Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.</i>

742
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>He actually went to law school.</i>

743
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,026
<i>I called him Rugrat because of
his piece of shit hairpiece.</i>

744
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,924
<i>Still, give them to me young,
hungry and stupid</i>

745
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,074
<i>and in no time,
I'll make them rich.</i>

746
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,494
Oh, my God.

747
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,874
Jordan, that...

748
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,267
You like it, baby?

749
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,120
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

750
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,605
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

751
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,583
but I promise they're
really high quality.

752
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,838
It's beautiful.

753
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,920
They're so beautiful.

754
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,634
Oh, boy.

755
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,113
What?

756
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,699
I know that look.
What is it? Go ahead.

757
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,427
I don't know, it's... You know...

758
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,350
These stocks... These companies...

759
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,456
They're like crappy companies.

760
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,854
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

761
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,318
Yeah, they're terrible.

762
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,461
Don't worry about it. I told you,

763
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,862
what I'm doing is completely legal.

764
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,963
Yeah, I know.

765
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,237
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

766
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,094
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

767
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,572
You know how it goes.

768
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,223
Wouldn't you feel better if you
sold that stuff to rich people

769
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,577
who can, like,
afford to lose all that money?

770
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,583
Of course.

771
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,711
But rich people don't
buy penny stocks.

772
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,668
They just don't.

773
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,295
Why not?

774
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,155
<i>Because they're too smart,</i>

775
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,508
<i>that's why not.</i>

776
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,535
<i>I mean, what person with
a college education</i>

777
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,911
<i>would trust this
bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

778
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,162
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

779
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,330
I got 5 fucking grand
on the phone right now!

780
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,581
Hey!

781
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,626
<i>But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

782
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,947
<i>What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?</i>

783
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,527
<i>Real money.</i>

784
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,034
<i>So I decided to
reinvent the company.</i>

785
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,454
Gentlemen, welcome

786
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,366
to Stratton Oakmont.

787
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,291
You schnooks will now be targeting

788
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,503
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

789
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,630
We're talking about whales here.

790
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,624
Moby fucking Dicks.

791
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,861
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

792
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,071
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

793
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,800
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

794
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,555
Get it? Huh?

795
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,803
Captain who?

796
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,472
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

797
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,149
The book, motherfucker.
From the book.

798
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,209
Turn your fucking brain on.

799
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,627
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

800
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,698
Listen to me. We're a
new company with a new name.

801
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,785
A company that our
clients can believe in.

802
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,863
A company that our
clients can trust.

803
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:57,641
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

804
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,145
that our very founders sailed over
on the Mayflower

805
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,044
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

806
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,462
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

807
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,169
You got it?

808
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,069
What we're gonna do is this.

809
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,364
First we pitch 'em
Disney, AT&T, IBM,

810
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,325
blue chip stocks exclusively.

811
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,599
Companies these people know.

812
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:20,691
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

813
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,875
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,

814
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,523
where we make the money.

815
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,730
- 50% commission, baby.
- Ooh.

816
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,840
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

817
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,945
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

818
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,930
Because by the time you read about
it in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

819
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,874
it's already too late.

820
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,100
Then you wait.

821
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,268
You wait.

822
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,963
And whoever speaks first loses.

823
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,216
<i>Sorry, uh...</i>

824
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,797
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

825
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,237
<i>I really have to give
this some thought</i>

826
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,072
<i>and talk to my wife about it.</i>

827
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,265
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

828
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,866
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

829
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,285
they gotta talk to their fucking
wives, or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

830
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,204
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

831
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,791
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

832
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,501
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

833
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,422
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

834
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,089
So, what do you say?

835
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,342
You mean to tell me that if I put
you in at Union Carbide at 7

836
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,865
and took you out at 32...

837
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,513
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

838
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,182
U.S. Steel at 16,
took you out at 41...

839
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,809
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,

840
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,686
"pick me up a few thousand
shares of Disney

841
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,414
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

842
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,314
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly?
Seriously?

843
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,732
<i>I don't know you.</i>

844
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,086
<i>You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.</i>

845
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,278
I am in complete
agreement with you.

846
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,052
You don't know me,
I don't know you.

847
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,281
Let me introduce myself to you.

848
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,740
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

849
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,184
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

850
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,077
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

851
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,579
and I plan on being one of the...

852
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,956
top brokers in my firm next year.

853
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,997
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

854
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,043
<i>I do wanna say that
you sound like a...</i>

855
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,878
<i>You sound like a
pretty sincere guy.</i>

856
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,046
<i>It's not gonna make you rich</i>

857
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,172
<i>and it's not gonna make you poor.</i>

858
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,742
But what this trade
will do is serve as...

859
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,112
a benchmark
for future business, Kevin.

860
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,013
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

861
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,347
And then you'll know for sure

862
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,516
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

863
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,143
that you can trust,

864
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,839
and who can consistently
make you money.

865
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,340
Sound fair enough?

866
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,336
<i>You know what... Yeah.</i>

867
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,964
<i>I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.</i>

868
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,116
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

869
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,218
Kevin.

870
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,745
You give me one shot here

871
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,456
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

872
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,708
and believe me, Kevin,

873
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,336
the only problem you're gonna have

874
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,860
is that you didn't buy more.

875
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,490
Sound fair enough?

876
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,076
<i>Shit. My...</i>

877
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,492
<i>Uh...</i>

878
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,616
<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i>

879
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,833
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

880
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,935
Excellent choice, Kevin.

881
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,834
How much do you
want to go for this time?

882
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,898
<i>Let's do 5... $5,000.</i>

883
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,149
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

884
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,593
<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i>

885
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,902
<i>- Ten.
- You want to do that?</i>

886
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:55,986
Excellent choice!

887
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,488
Kevin, let me lock in
that trade right now

888
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,781
and get back to you
in a few minutes

889
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,240
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

890
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,910
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

891
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,184
<i>Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.</i>

892
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,413
<i>This is fun.</i>

893
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,686
Take it easy, Kev.

894
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,692
<i>Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...</i>

895
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,400
Fuck that motherfucker!

896
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,356
That's what I'm talking about!

897
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,114
What a fucking idiot.

898
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,660
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

899
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,118
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

900
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,334
Get in now or...

901
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,103
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

902
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,396
and I'm a Senior Vice President

903
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,714
with Stratton Oakmont.

904
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:35,969
Judy, I am so, so, so
sorry for your loss.

905
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,486
When did he pass?

906
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,570
Just say I'm wrong, right.

907
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,697
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

908
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,281
and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

909
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,159
God rest his soul,
"A shit ton of money."

910
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,369
It's like getting in
on fucking sunlight

911
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,017
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

912
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,914
<i>Can we do 8,000 shares?</i>

913
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,483
<i>Okay, 25,000.</i>

914
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,585
That's a very intelligent decision.

915
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,346
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

916
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,232
Rhonda!

917
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,258
- Rhonda!
- ...put you through to Andrea.

918
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,077
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

919
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,809
<i>Everybody have a good week?</i>

920
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,002
Yeah!

921
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,479
<i>The end of the month.</i>

922
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,150
<i>$28.7 million in gross commissions,</i>

923
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,970
<i>all from pink sheet stock, boys!</i>

924
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,699
<i>And to celebrate with our
weekly act of debauchery,</i>

925
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,534
<i>I have offered our
lovely sales assistant,</i>

926
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,536
<i>Danielle Harrison, here,</i>

927
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:31,331
<i>$10,000 to shave her fucking head!</i>

928
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,558
Yeah!

929
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,112
Yeah, you want this?

930
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,272
You want this?

931
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,782
<i>Let's scalp her! Scalp her!</i>

932
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,176
Let the scalping begin!

933
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,290
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

934
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,435
<i>FYI, boys, Danielle has promised</i>

935
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,480
<i>to use this $10,000
for breast implants!</i>

936
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,898
<i>She's already got C cups,</i>

937
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,001
<i>but now she wants
fucking double D's!</i>

938
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,716
<i>Is this a great fucking
company or what?</i>

939
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,051
<i>Is this the greatest company
in the world?</i>

940
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,475
<i>Donnie!</i>

941
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,983
<i>Blow the roof off
this motherfucker!</i>

942
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,259
- Champagne?
- Whoo!

943
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,640
<i>Send in the stripees!</i>

944
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,047
Mine!

945
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,756
<i>Word about us
spread throughout Wall Street.</i>

946
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,734
<i>Even the places I
didn't want it to.</i>

947
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,812
<i>It wasn't long before
Forbes magazine,</i>

948
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,648
<i>the flagship of Wall Street,
called to do a profile on me.</i>

949
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,068
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

950
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,341
One word?

951
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,137
Diversification.

952
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,200
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

953
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,285
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

954
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,387
Can we get a quick picture?

955
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,934
<i>A total fucking hatchet job.</i>

956
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,148
<i>This conniving little twat!
Look at this!</i>

957
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,147
"The Wolf of Wall Street"
they call me. Look.

958
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,319
Your hair looks good.

959
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,882
- Well, my hair looks good.
- Yeah.

960
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,342
"Jordan Belfort,

961
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,928
"sounding like a kind
of twisted Robin Hood

962
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,657
"who takes from the rich
and gives to himself

963
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,515
"and his merry little
band of brokers."

964
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,993
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

965
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,896
There is no such thing as
bad publicity, sweetheart.

966
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,340
Read the article, babe.

967
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,043
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

968
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,420
Big fucking deal I look great.

969
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,321
Mr. Belfort!
Can you look at my resume, please?

970
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,345
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

971
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,220
Calm the fuck down!

972
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,100
What the hell's all this?

973
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,024
It's the Forbes article.
They all want to work for you now.

974
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,208
Hey! What did I say?

975
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,526
I'm just trying to be nice.

976
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,446
Hey, you want a job,
you talk to me!

977
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,814
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

978
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,530
Forbes made me a superstar.

979
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:15,582
<i>Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.</i>

980
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,559
<i>If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight</i>

981
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,269
<i>and spent whatever
allowance they had</i>

982
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,772
<i>on a new suit from
our Stratton tailor.</i>

983
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,420
Are you fucking serious right now?

984
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,592
<i>I mean, we were literally putting
clothes on these kids' backs.</i>

985
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,215
<i>And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.</i>

986
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,909
<i>But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,</i>

987
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,389
<i>there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.</i>

988
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,893
<i>Within months, we doubled in size,</i>

989
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,735
<i>moved to even bigger offices.</i>

990
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,403
<i>It was a madhouse.</i>

991
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,033
<i>A greed-fest,</i>

992
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:59,034
<i>with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.</i>

993
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,618
Yes!

994
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:05,230
<i>It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone</i>

995
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,208
<i>between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.</i>

996
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,943
<i>But I'm telling you,
even that didn't help.</i>

997
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,113
<i>Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,</i>

998
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,656
<i>when one of our
brokers, Ben Jenner,</i>

999
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,867
<i>christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob</i>

1000
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,452
<i>from a sales assistant.</i>

1001
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,454
<i>Her name was Pam,
and to her credit,</i>

1002
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,789
<i>she did have this
amazing technique,</i>

1003
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,564
<i>with this wild twist
and jerk motion.</i>

1004
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,085
<i>About a month later,</i>

1005
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,087
<i>Donnie and I decided
to double-team her</i>

1006
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,338
<i>on a Saturday afternoon</i>

1007
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,192
<i>while our wives were out shopping
for Christmas dresses.</i>

1008
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,843
<i>Eventually, Ben married her,</i>

1009
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,387
<i>which was pretty amazing
considering she blew</i>

1010
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,786
<i>every single guy in the office.</i>

1011
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,127
<i>Then he got depressed and killed
himself three years later.</i>

1012
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:47,647
<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.</i>

1013
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,750
<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i>

1014
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,279
<i>We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,</i>

1015
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,739
<i>which could be set off by something</i>

1016
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,741
<i>as innocuous as a
ringing telephone.</i>

1017
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,079
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

1018
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,808
to call this house
on a Tuesday night?

1019
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,042
God damn it!

1020
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,168
You're gonna miss it!

1021
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,087
Ooh, please, tell me
something I don't know.

1022
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,923
I wait all week for
the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>

1023
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,300
and they have to fucking... Hello.

1024
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,094
<i>But as soon as
he picked up the phone...</i>

1025
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,492
Gene. How are you, Gene?

1026
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,514
<i>he'd affect this weird
British accent.</i>

1027
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,367
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

1028
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,101
Cheerio.

1029
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,185
<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i>

1030
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,853
The fucking halfwit!

1031
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:27,979
<i>- He'd hang up...</i>
- You missed it!

1032
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,003
<i>and then he's Mad
Max all over again.</i>

1033
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,459
Damn it!

1034
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,382
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

1035
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,946
Well, he discovered it
was the mother's sister.

1036
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,447
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

1037
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,116
The main guy.
You know who the main...

1038
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,283
The main guy...

1039
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,728
it was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

1040
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,705
<i>Of course, Mad
Max didn't have to know</i>

1041
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,524
<i>everything we were
doing at Stratton.</i>

1042
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,648
And then there's a
big target and we...

1043
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,650
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

1044
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,880
<i>There's a bull's-eye
and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i>

1045
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,048
<i>Whoever gets closer
to the dollar sign...</i>

1046
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,091
gets the most points.

1047
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,385
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

1048
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,387
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

1049
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,721
'Cause we're gonna
get fucking nuts.

1050
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,056
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

1051
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,933
They got like superhuman strength.

1052
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,226
I think he's gonna be fine.

1053
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,228
You can't look him
right in the eyes.

1054
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,479
You can't look him in the eye?

1055
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,253
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

1056
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,191
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

1057
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,818
You gotta look at their chin.

1058
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:15,944
Like it looks like
I'm looking at you

1059
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,028
but I'm looking at your chin.

1060
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,239
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

1061
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,241
They're like <i>the Mona Lisa.</i>
They find eye contact,

1062
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,889
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

1063
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,178
And they lock in.

1064
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,687
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

1065
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,081
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

1066
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,583
We're allowed to
throw food? Bananas.

1067
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,084
Any food. Correct.

1068
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,252
But, for example,
what I wouldn't do is

1069
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,087
maybe like tell him
to pull his cock out

1070
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,861
and like get some of the girls to,
you know,

1071
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,048
fondle him and shit like that.

1072
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,133
That would be...
That's unacceptable?

1073
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,217
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1074
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,303
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

1075
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,405
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1076
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,847
The thing is, this
is their gift, okay.

1077
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,974
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1078
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,267
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1079
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,351
So they're built for accuracy.

1080
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,375
Oh, my God. Can we
bowl with this guy?

1081
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,563
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1082
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:52,981
His brother's the bowling ball.

1083
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,774
The brother,
you put a skateboard on him,

1084
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,109
you strap him to a skateboard,

1085
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,611
you toss him down an
alley at some pins.

1086
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,321
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1087
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,406
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1088
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,575
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1089
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,910
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1090
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,286
They are very ornery by the way,

1091
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,787
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1092
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,872
Safety first.

1093
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,040
Safety is first, all right?

1094
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,958
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1095
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,710
ready to knock this fucker out.

1096
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,962
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1097
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,047
A pellet gun maybe?

1098
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,256
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1099
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,737
I just want him out.
Knocked out cold.

1100
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,362
But I say we stick with
the loophole. Right? Okay?

1101
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,304
If we don't consider him a human,

1102
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,556
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1103
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,682
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1104
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,726
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1105
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,561
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1106
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,505
is that these things gossip.

1107
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,148
They get together and they gossip.

1108
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,650
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1109
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,902
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1110
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,570
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1111
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,239
Like, it's gonna make
Stratton look bad.

1112
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,407
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1113
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,512
When they come in, we treat
it just like one of us. Okay?

1114
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,891
One of us.
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1115
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,562
We accept them, one of us!

1116
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,352
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1117
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:55,752
We accept them, one of us.

1118
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,878
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1119
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,255
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

1120
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,824
Something about the
American Express bill.

1121
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,074
Can you get him out of here?

1122
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,284
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1123
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,615
No, I'm serious!

1124
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,054
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1125
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,623
You got any fucking stock forms?

1126
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,224
He's coming, he's coming.

1127
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,451
Make some shit up.

1128
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,582
I think if we short Pfizer...

1129
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:17,588
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1130
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:22,988
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1131
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,198
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1132
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,533
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1133
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,034
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1134
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,981
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1135
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,812
Okay. No, no.
This could be explained.

1136
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,319
Dad, we had clients.
The Pfizer clients.

1137
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,253
Right. The porterhouse
from Argentina.

1138
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,547
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1139
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,150
And you ordered all
the fucking sides.

1140
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,217
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1141
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,788
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1142
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,165
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1143
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,142
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1144
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,665
That's why they were expensive.

1145
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,671
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1146
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,731
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1147
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,505
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1148
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,402
Well, that's, uh...

1149
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,611
Yeah, Jordy,
what's EJ Entertainment?

1150
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,738
How do I describe this?

1151
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,864
Jord, what is that?

1152
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,059
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1153
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,177
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1154
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,287
Isn't that the perfect
description for it?

1155
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,956
That is what it is. But none
of these were charged to me.

1156
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,354
This is all of them.

1157
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,251
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1158
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,195
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1159
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,732
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1160
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,425
The IRS, they allow
for T&A. It's fine.

1161
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,718
T&E!

1162
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,866
T&E!

1163
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,012
Yeah. I said T&E.

1164
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,388
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1165
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,473
Yeah, you did.

1166
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,850
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1167
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,226
I know you're upset
about the dinner,

1168
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:39,606
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1169
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,316
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1170
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,692
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1171
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,110
Absolutely, no question.

1172
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,362
I'm trying to...

1173
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,488
I'm getting this close!

1174
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,781
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1175
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,325
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1176
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,451
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1177
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,099
Why do you hold it in?
Why do you...

1178
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,871
Max, why do you hold it in?

1179
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,690
That's it. Get the
fuck out of here!

1180
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,105
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1181
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,233
What kind of hooker
takes credit cards?

1182
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,379
A rich one.

1183
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,798
<i>At Stratton,
there were three kinds of hookers.</i>

1184
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,175
<i>The Blue Chips, top of the line,
model material.</i>

1185
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,760
<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i>

1186
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,136
<i>and you had to wear a condom</i>

1187
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,638
<i>unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i>

1188
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,582
<i>which, of course, I always did.</i>

1189
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,310
<i>Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.</i>

1190
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,729
<i>They cost between
200 and 300 bucks.</i>

1191
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,299
<i>Finally, there were the
Pink Sheets. Skanks.</i>

1192
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,276
<i>They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,</i>

1193
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,611
<i>you'd have to get a penicillin shot</i>

1194
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,072
<i>the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.</i>

1195
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,016
<i>Not that we didn't fuck them, too.</i>

1196
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,927
<i>Believe me, we did.</i>

1197
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,767
Ow! It's that slipped
disc thing again.

1198
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,315
I know what it is.
You know, too much...

1199
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,125
with EJ Entertainment.

1200
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,209
Pops.

1201
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,653
How are things at home?

1202
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,313
Well, not the best.

1203
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,941
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1204
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,508
It's like the smell...

1205
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,202
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1206
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,846
After a while it kind of fades away
a little bit.

1207
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,597
Yeah, well. It's
supposed to fade away.

1208
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,621
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1209
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,336
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1210
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,562
What do you think? We're, we're...

1211
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,506
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1212
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,966
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1213
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,210
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1214
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,610
It's crazy out there.

1215
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,195
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1216
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,548
Oh, my God!

1217
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,198
They're fucking...

1218
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,200
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1219
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,645
I mean... I mean, it's
on a whole other level.

1220
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,309
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1221
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,852
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1222
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,312
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1223
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,652
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1224
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,734
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1225
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:29,424
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1226
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:30,508
It's a new world.

1227
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,552
They're bald from
the eyebrows down.

1228
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:35,156
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1229
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,581
Wow. A new world.

1230
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,702
I was born too... Too early.

1231
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,004
I've never been a fan of the bush,
to be honest.

1232
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,396
- Really?
- Yeah.

1233
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,589
I don't mind it.

1234
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:45,958
Dad.

1235
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,502
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1236
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,861
How can I not get stressed out?

1237
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,321
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1238
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,572
I know they're knuckleheads

1239
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,926
but I need them to want to
live like me, you get it?

1240
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,343
To live like me.

1241
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,807
Jordy.

1242
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,649
One of these days, the chickens are
gonna come home to roost.

1243
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,478
You're looking at
me like I'm crazy.

1244
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,948
Crazy? This is obscene.

1245
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,525
<i>It was obscene.</i>

1246
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,280
<i>In the normal world.</i>

1247
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,783
<i>But who the fuck
wanted to live there?</i>

1248
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,620
<i>Go party your fucking cocks off!</i>

1249
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:25,544
<i>We are about to
become fucking legends</i>

1250
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,549
<i>on Wall Street!</i>

1251
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:32,111
<i>We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company</i>

1252
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,182
<i>into the fucking stratosphere!</i>

1253
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,887
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1254
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,734
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1255
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,294
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1256
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,587
This way we become
the underwriters.

1257
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,214
<i>It was our next big move.</i>

1258
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,884
<i>Finding companies to
take public. IPOs.</i>

1259
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,761
<i>It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks</i>

1260
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,557
<i>would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.</i>

1261
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:01,875
We got Arncliffe International.

1262
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,476
<i>See, we were a little different.</i>

1263
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:07,146
<i>We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows</i>

1264
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,691
<i>in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,</i>

1265
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:12,796
<i>which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.</i>

1266
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,926
Steve Madden.

1267
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,615
We own the fucking companies...

1268
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,492
We own the companies...

1269
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,516
<i>Don't know what
a lude is? I'll tell you.</i>

1270
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,602
<i>Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

1271
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:28,440
<i>Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.</i>

1272
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,244
The Quaalude,

1273
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,205
<i>or lude, as it is
commonly referred to,</i>

1274
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,833
<i>was first synthesized in 1951</i>

1275
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,586
<i>by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,</i>

1276
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,087
<i>as a sedative,</i>

1277
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,034
<i>and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.</i>

1278
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,886
<i>But pretty soon someone figured out</i>

1279
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,723
<i>that if you resisted the urge
to sleep for just 15 minutes,</i>

1280
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,202
<i>you got a pretty
kick-ass high from it.</i>

1281
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:30,172
<i>Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes, of course.</i>

1282
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,463
<i>And in 1982, the U-S.
government Schedule 1'd them.</i>

1283
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,669
<i>Along with the rest of the world.</i>

1284
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:39,098
<i>Which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left.</i>

1285
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,134
<i>No shit,
you can't even buy 'em anymore.</i>

1286
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,682
<i>You people are all
shit out of luck.</i>

1287
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,287
What are you saying? What is it?

1288
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,560
Steve Madden.

1289
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,558
Steve Madden.

1290
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,934
Steve.

1291
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,185
Steve.

1292
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,920
<i>You remember those ads?</i>

1293
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,381
<i>Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes</i>

1294
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,109
<i>wearing those big clunky shoes?</i>

1295
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,385
My friend from school,
Steve Madden.

1296
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,844
His friend from
school, Steve Madden.

1297
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,722
<i>Steve Madden was the name in
women's shoes at the moment.</i>

1298
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,518
<i>And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.</i>

1299
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,852
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1300
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,229
<i>Except, guess who grew up with him?</i>

1301
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,106
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1302
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,756
<i>My very own Vice President.</i>

1303
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,652
Women's shoes!

1304
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:19,551
<i>Diamond Donnie Azoff.</i>

1305
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,240
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

1306
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,658
Steve.

1307
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,784
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1308
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,057
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1309
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:27,930
Look at this. Look.

1310
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,878
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1311
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,402
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1312
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,739
You want to see
the Wolf handle this?

1313
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,697
She's hot.

1314
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,535
Cristy.

1315
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,505
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1316
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:56,149
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1317
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,752
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1318
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,636
You got an awesome place here.

1319
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,988
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1320
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,261
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1321
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,591
Beautiful beach out there.

1322
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,842
Blair Hollingsworth.

1323
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,102
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1324
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,855
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1325
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,230
You like to Jet Ski?

1326
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,874
I've never done it before.

1327
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,958
You've never
Jet Ski'd in your life?

1328
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,001
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1329
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,544
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1330
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,795
How many times are
you gonna ask her?

1331
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,273
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1332
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,946
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1333
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,620
Okay. Sure.

1334
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,555
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1335
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,624
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1336
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,119
Yeah, I'll be out in
a couple of minutes.

1337
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,518
Just tell her I'll be out
in a couple of minutes.

1338
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,061
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1339
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,146
I might do that, but I'm having

1340
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,647
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1341
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,691
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1342
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,013
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1343
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,549
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1344
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,305
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1345
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,678
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1346
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,866
But we can stay for a drink...

1347
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,184
She's

1348
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,012
perfect.

1349
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,621
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1350
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,705
She's perfect.

1351
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,207
Donnie, what the
fuck are you doing?

1352
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,981
You piece of...

1353
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,320
You're gonna have to excuse my friend.
He gets...

1354
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:07,720
Get the fuck out!

1355
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,522
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1356
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:10,991
Yeah, Donnie!

1357
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,143
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1358
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,871
That's fucking rude.

1359
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,793
Have some fucking manners.

1360
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,758
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1361
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,177
Brooklyn, across the
Verrazano Bridge.

1362
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,845
<i>Saturday Night Fever</i> territory.

1363
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,468
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1364
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,828
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1365
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,995
Right.

1366
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,723
So I presume you're Italian?

1367
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,998
On my dad's side.

1368
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,319
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1369
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,900
I'm a mutt.

1370
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,405
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1371
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,820
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1372
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,593
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1373
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,638
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

1374
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,056
That explains it then.

1375
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,140
Explains what?

1376
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,040
It explains you.
I mean, you're a duchess, right?

1377
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,209
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1378
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,650
Excuse me.

1379
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,719
Could I get a straw, please?

1380
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,389
Thank you.

1381
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,228
So I was, um, a little surprised

1382
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,643
you asked Cristy for my number.

1383
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,975
Why is that?

1384
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,694
Aren't you married?

1385
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,214
Well... Yeah, but what?

1386
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,238
Married people can't have friends?

1387
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,079
We're gonna be friends?

1388
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,243
Yeah. You don't want
to be my friend?

1389
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,336
We're not gonna be friends.

1390
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:52,267
And at night I work on my designs.

1391
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,036
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1392
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,016
You know, camisoles,
bustiers, panties.

1393
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,417
<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i>

1394
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,236
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1395
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,200
<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.</i>

1396
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,791
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1397
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,752
Tea? Yeah.

1398
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:28,736
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1399
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,134
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1400
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,516
<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah,
I wanted to come up for tea.</i>

1401
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,660
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1402
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:36,702
Sure.

1403
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,975
This is Rocky.

1404
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,482
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1405
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,941
Hi, sweetheart.

1406
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,147
Okay.

1407
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,313
Why don't you light a fire or
something and I'll be right out.

1408
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,736
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1409
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,699
I like your painting here.
It's, uh...

1410
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:03,456
<i>God, help me.
How do I fuck this girl?</i>

1411
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,067
You all right?

1412
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,512
Yeah, yeah.
Just trying to light the fire here.

1413
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,702
<i>That's it. That's it,
you're leaving.</i>

1414
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,680
<i>Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.</i>

1415
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,424
<i>As you can probably guess,</i>

1416
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,119
<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i>

1417
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,928
Jesus Lord!

1418
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,409
<i>For 11 seconds.</i>

1419
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,800
Did you just come?

1420
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,844
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1421
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,225
Did you? Did you come?

1422
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,951
- No.
- No?

1423
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,178
Okay.

1424
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,397
I'm still hard so
just give me a sec.

1425
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,895
Sure.

1426
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,852
Come on, baby, come on.

1427
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,573
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1428
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,822
Oh, God!

1429
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,824
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1430
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,141
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1431
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,243
It's okay.

1432
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,019
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1433
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,997
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

1434
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,816
You're crazy.

1435
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,151
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>

1436
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,612
<i>I mean, her pussy was
like heroin to me.</i>

1437
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,448
<i>And it wasn't just
about the sex, either.</i>

1438
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,492
<i>Naomi and I got along.
I mean, we...</i>

1439
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:41,470
<i>We had similar interests and shit.</i>

1440
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,435
Ooh. Choo-choo train.

1441
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:49,819
Yeah.

1442
00:59:56,885 --> 01:00:00,706
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1443
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,003
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1444
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,732
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1445
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,210
Oh, shit!

1446
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,954
You!

1447
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,081
Get out of the fucking car!

1448
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,499
Jesus Christ.

1449
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,149
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1450
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,280
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1451
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,049
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1452
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,493
Okay, babe, stop!

1453
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,783
- Please.
- Bitch!

1454
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,180
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1455
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,765
Jesus Christ!

1456
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,891
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1457
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,268
I thought you were at
the fucking beach!

1458
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,712
I didn't know you were here!

1459
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,312
That's where you've fucking been?

1460
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,064
With that fucking
whore from the party?

1461
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,607
I thought you were
at the beach house.

1462
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,067
How could you do this to me?

1463
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,903
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1464
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,781
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1465
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:04,011
I made a mistake. I don't know
what to tell you, babe. I...

1466
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,683
I'm sorry.

1467
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,390
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1468
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,194
Do you love her?

1469
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,367
Answer me.

1470
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,020
<i>I felt horrible.</i>

1471
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,792
<i>Three days later,
I filed for a divorce</i>

1472
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,895
<i>and moved Naomi into the apartment.</i>

1473
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,383
<i>Say what you will,</i>

1474
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,636
<i>but the Duchess did have style.</i>

1475
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:06,889
<i>She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.</i>

1476
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,016
<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i>

1477
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:11,977
<i>This guy was smart,</i>
<i>sophisticated, professional</i>

1478
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,705
<i>Really, really great.</i>

1479
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,127
Is that jasmine?

1480
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,126
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1481
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:20,069
Very good. Great nose.

1482
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,843
<i>Except for that one time.</i>

1483
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,261
Oh, my God!

1484
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,439
Oh, hey.

1485
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,233
Is it Wednesday already?

1486
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,501
- Uh...
- Oh, don't stop.

1487
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,694
What the fuck!

1488
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,780
That is fucked up!

1489
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,464
He must have thought we were still

1490
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,132
at the Hamptons this weekend,
you know.

1491
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,592
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1492
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,345
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1493
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,680
There were more over here.

1494
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,223
- There were four right here.
- Ugh!

1495
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,975
Are you fucking serious?
Right there?

1496
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,852
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1497
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,962
After they left,
I checked the apartment.

1498
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,130
Right. What?

1499
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,336
What is it, babe? What?

1500
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,736
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1501
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:03,821
I don't know where your money...

1502
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:05,906
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1503
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,950
I don't know where your money is,
Mr. Belfort.

1504
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,286
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1505
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,662
He's lying through
his fucking teeth.

1506
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:12,913
Let's start from the beginning.

1507
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,206
Let's start from the
beginning, all right?

1508
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,900
You invited some
friends over, right?

1509
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,835
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1510
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,378
We understand that, we do.

1511
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,922
We do blow all the time. We're
fucking degenerates ourselves.

1512
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,090
Look at us, right?

1513
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:24,758
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

1514
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,385
Right from my sock drawer.
All right?

1515
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,595
Like I said,
I don't know where your money is.

1516
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,055
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1517
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,181
It was just a normal day.

1518
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,558
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1519
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,935
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1520
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,895
I got a little high at breakfast.

1521
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,814
So I got a little happy.
I had some eggs,

1522
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,898
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1523
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,817
And then I said, "Who do I
know that likes ice cream?"

1524
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,360
It's my friend, Rudy.
So I called Rudy.

1525
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,930
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1526
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,743
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1527
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:51,994
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1528
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,120
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1529
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,246
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1530
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,831
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1531
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,980
You know who Rudy is?

1532
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,419
I don't fucking know any...

1533
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,462
What do you mean?

1534
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,629
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1535
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,298
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1536
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,924
On the stage, grinding
with everybody.

1537
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,572
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1538
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,595
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1539
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,323
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1540
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,098
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1541
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,433
from my fucking sock drawer!

1542
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,018
All my girlfriend's
jewelry is gone.

1543
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,020
- Where the fuck is it?
- ...Rudy. What the fuck?

1544
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,147
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1545
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,921
Did he? Answer me!

1546
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,506
Okay. Now I get it.
Now I get why I'm...

1547
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:25,758
- This is a gay thing.
- Oh!

1548
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,696
See, all of you...

1549
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,217
You think this is
'cause you're a fag?

1550
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,200
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1551
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,619
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1552
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,870
You were in charge, right?

1553
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,622
I will not be stolen from.
You get that?

1554
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,916
I fucking like gay people.
I don't like you.

1555
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,292
He should've hired
a fucking Mexican

1556
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,645
like I have in my fucking house.

1557
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,864
Shit! What the fuck...

1558
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,427
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1559
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:51,637
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1560
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,055
Where is it?

1561
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,100
<i>Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.</i>

1562
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,267
<i>You know, they got crazy.</i>

1563
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,415
I don't know!

1564
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:02,127
<i>I had to call the cops just to
keep them from killing the poor guy.</i>

1565
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,649
<i>I gave them each 1,000 bucks</i>

1566
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,844
<i>and told them what
Nicholas had done.</i>

1567
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,504
<i>Then they kicked his ass.</i>

1568
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:09,343
Thanks again, Officer.

1569
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,324
<i>It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.</i>

1570
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,992
<i>I was making that much
almost every day</i>

1571
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,370
<i>through one rathole or another.</i>

1572
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,206
<i>Now a rathole is a
friend, like Brad here,</i>

1573
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,834
<i>who held stock in his name for me.</i>

1574
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,169
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1575
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,797
<i>I'd drive the price up
then he'd sell</i>

1576
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,007
<i>and kick most of the
profits back to...</i>

1577
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,985
<i>You guessed it, me.</i>

1578
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,265
<i>All cash. None of
it's on the books.</i>

1579
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,619
<i>A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.</i>

1580
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,672
<i>Enter our new securities attorney,
Manny Riskin.</i>

1581
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:46,400
<i>700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.</i>

1582
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,193
Listen to me.
You piss up the SEC's leg,

1583
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,528
you end up with your
tits in a ringer.

1584
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:52,633
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1585
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,476
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1586
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,910
Hey! Hey!

1587
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,370
What are you doing? Hey!

1588
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,814
We got the SEC in here.

1589
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,499
<i>The Securities
and Exchange Commission</i>

1590
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,169
<i>sent two lawyers down
to review our files.</i>

1591
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,171
<i>So I set them up in
our conference room</i>

1592
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,338
<i>and I had it bugged</i>

1593
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,632
<i>and the air conditioning
turned up so high</i>

1594
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,217
<i>that it felt like
Antarctica in there.</i>

1595
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,303
Is it always this cold in here?

1596
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,387
I don't know.

1597
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,680
<i>Then, while they were looking</i>

1598
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,182
<i>for a smoking gun in that room...</i>

1599
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,081
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1600
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,395
<i>I was gonna fire off
a bazooka in here,</i>

1601
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,731
<i>offering up our latest IPO.</i>

1602
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:28,317
An IPO is an initial
public offering.

1603
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,154
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1604
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,072
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1605
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,866
we set the initial sales price

1606
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,686
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1607
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,412
Look.

1608
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,390
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1609
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,416
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1610
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,335
The real question is this.

1611
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,295
"Was all this legal?"

1612
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,273
Absolutely fucking not.

1613
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,026
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1614
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:58,555
<i>And what do you do
when you're making</i>

1615
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,329
<i>more money than you
know what to do with?</i>

1616
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,544
Oh, my God!

1617
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,542
Will you marry me?

1618
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,443
Oh, my God.

1619
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,546
Is that a yes?

1620
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,280
Are you sure?

1621
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,258
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1622
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,018
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1623
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:33,199
<i>I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.</i>

1624
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,652
<i>The flight there alone
was a bacchanal.</i>

1625
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,803
<i>One last blowout for the gods</i>

1626
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,872
<i>before I settled down for good.</i>

1627
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,640
<i>A hundred Strattonites,</i>

1628
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,585
<i>50 hookers, plus 50 more
waiting once we landed.</i>

1629
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,270
<i>Oh, and the drugs.</i>

1630
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:50,217
<i>I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.</i>

1631
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,957
<i>All told, the weekend
cost me 2 million bucks,</i>

1632
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:28,079
<i>including the cost of refurbishing
the entire 28th floor.</i>

1633
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,480
kiss the bride.

1634
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,817
<i>Ah! But the wedding</i>

1635
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,046
<i>was something out of a fairy tale.</i>

1636
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,197
<i>With Naomi, my Duchess,</i>

1637
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,782
<i>me, her handsome Duke,</i>

1638
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,932
<i>and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.</i>

1639
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,633
<i>Of course, after the bachelor
party, me, the Duke,</i>

1640
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,469
<i>needed a few penicillin shots
so he could</i>

1641
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,698
<i>safely consummate the marriage.</i>

1642
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,829
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1643
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,376
A few words for your son?

1644
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,107
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1645
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,319
It involves your penis
and her vagina.

1646
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,390
And you know,
you know what you can do, Jordy.

1647
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,174
Oh, my God!

1648
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,652
Aunt Emma?

1649
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,741
I can't believe you came!

1650
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,415
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1651
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,205
It's Aunt Emma.

1652
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,419
Aunt Emma.

1653
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,884
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1654
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:00,426
It's a pleasure to finally meet you
in person.

1655
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,406
Into the donuts, I see.

1656
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,783
Oh, I... I...

1657
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:05,885
Well...

1658
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:09,246
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1659
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,815
Enjoy the day.

1660
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,313
She surprised me.
I didn't even know.

1661
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,141
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1662
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,809
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1663
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,253
One, two, three!

1664
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:35,748
What is this?

1665
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,982
It's your wedding present.

1666
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,108
What?

1667
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:40,428
It's your wedding present,
sweetheart.

1668
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,214
What?

1669
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,781
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1670
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:45,929
A fucking yacht?

1671
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,994
<i>For millionaires
whose ships have come in,</i>

1672
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,830
<i>pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.</i>

1673
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:55,041
<i>It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull</i>

1674
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,294
<i>is the color of cash.
Anchors aweigh!</i>

1675
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,648
Oh, my God! Baby!

1676
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,592
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1677
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,115
- You like it?
- Yes!

1678
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,560
<i>For three weeks, we sailed
the Naomi through the Caribbean,</i>

1679
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,645
<i>eventually taking her home
to Long Island,</i>

1680
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,813
<i>where we bought a house.</i>

1681
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,508
<i>Seven acres on the Gold Coast
of Long Island.</i>

1682
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,068
<i>The most expensive real estate
in the world.</i>

1683
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:24,821
<i>With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.</i>

1684
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,365
<i>We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.</i>

1685
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,809
<i>Both named Rocco.</i>

1686
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,774
<i>It was heaven on earth.</i>

1687
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,044
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1688
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,879
- Ow!
- Who's Venice?

1689
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,297
- Huh?
"Who?

1690
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,381
Who? Who?

1691
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,133
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1692
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,426
Who is she?

1693
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,886
Some little hooker you
were fucking last night?

1694
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,888
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1695
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,598
No way, baby, no!

1696
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,997
You were calling her
name in your sleep!

1697
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,746
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I don't...

1698
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,897
I don't even know who Venice is.

1699
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:01,233
What the fuck does that even mean?
Venice.

1700
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,087
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1701
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,059
Venice...

1702
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,637
Venice, baby, where are you?

1703
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,643
Venice!

1704
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:16,850
Venice!

1705
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,583
Where'd you go?

1706
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:25,423
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1707
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,717
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1708
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,202
I like it. I like it. Ow.

1709
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,057
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1710
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,100
Wolfie?

1711
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,643
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1712
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,353
I don't give a fuck
about your safe word!

1713
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,313
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1714
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,792
- Ahh!
- Shut up, you little bitch!

1715
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,318
You're a fucking
dirty little birdy!

1716
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,420
Owie!

1717
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,468
That's right.

1718
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:49,865
That's right! I forgot.

1719
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,434
I forgot, baby.

1720
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,618
Donnie and I were investing

1721
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,829
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1722
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,038
That's why all this confusion.

1723
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,623
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1724
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,458
Not Italy. California.

1725
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,043
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1726
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,253
You're a lying piece of shit!

1727
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:04,504
Duchess, baby, come on.

1728
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,152
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1729
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,799
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1730
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,904
Do you really think that I
don't know what you're up to?

1731
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,888
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1732
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,389
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1733
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,141
And you're still
acting like an infant!

1734
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,916
God damn it!

1735
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,919
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1736
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,316
Who is the one who flew in here

1737
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:27,277
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1738
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,404
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1739
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,133
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1740
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,198
<i>Does it even matter to you</i>

1741
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,939
that I just had that driving range

1742
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:50,216
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1743
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,135
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1744
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,034
No, you didn't research
the whole thing

1745
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,348
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

1746
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,599
Oh, my God,

1747
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,185
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

1748
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,005
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

1749
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,982
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

1750
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,275
What a fucking burden.

1751
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,319
And actually do some work
besides swiping

1752
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,529
my fucking credit
card all day, huh?

1753
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,324
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

1754
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,284
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1755
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,370
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1756
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,163
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1757
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:22,248
Don't fucking dare throw that

1758
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,818
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1759
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,150
All right, honey?

1760
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,755
Now will you just...

1761
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,715
We could talk this out, all right?

1762
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,160
We just use our words. You know?

1763
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,344
Communicate.

1764
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:35,662
Okay?

1765
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,494
Come on, sweetheart.

1766
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,541
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1767
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,685
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1768
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,478
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1769
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,562
Babe, come on.

1770
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:48,108
You should feel happy
you got a husband

1771
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,462
who's in such great
shape like this, huh?

1772
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:52,487
Come here.

1773
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,072
Come on, give me a kiss.

1774
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,240
You look so beautiful right now.

1775
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,449
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1776
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,701
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1777
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,429
Yeah, give me one...

1778
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,705
Fuck you!

1779
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,808
<i>Ah, yes, my morning ritual.</i>

1780
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,251
<i>First I'd get up and
fight with Naomi</i>

1781
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,545
<i>about whatever it is I did
the night before.</i>

1782
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,839
<i>Next was a steam so
I could sweat out</i>

1783
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,674
<i>the drugs still in my system.</i>

1784
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,402
<i>Then I'd assess the damage.</i>

1785
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:16,404
<i>Drown out my eyeballs.</i>

1786
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:19,014
<i>Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,</i>

1787
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,209
<i>then seek to make up with Naomi.</i>

1788
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,248
Good morning, Daddy.

1789
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,045
Where's my kiss?

1790
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,165
Whee!

1791
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,875
Hey, sweetheart.

1792
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:33,611
Does Daddy get a kiss
from both of his little girls, huh?

1793
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,071
Oh, no.

1794
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,241
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1795
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,094
for a very, very,

1796
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:41,930
very long time.

1797
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,206
Daddy's really sorry about what
he said in the other room.

1798
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,499
He didn't mean any of it.

1799
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,898
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1800
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:51,029
And from now on,

1801
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,571
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1802
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,036
short skirts around the house.

1803
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,124
And you know something else, Daddy?

1804
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:09,215
Mommy is just so sick and
tired of wearing panties.

1805
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,923
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1806
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,759
In fact,

1807
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,493
she's decided to throw them

1808
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,768
all away.

1809
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,446
So take a good look, Daddy.

1810
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:35,924
You're gonna be seeing an awful
lot of this around the house.

1811
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,550
Oh, baby...

1812
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,119
Yeah, Mommy.

1813
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,535
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1814
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,707
Oh, gosh.

1815
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,414
Ow.

1816
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,896
What's wrong, Daddy?

1817
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,340
Mmm, baby.

1818
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,631
God!

1819
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,467
Look at this shit.

1820
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:01,351
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1821
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,684
Mommy, have you ever noticed

1822
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,640
anything odd about Mr...

1823
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,733
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1824
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:15,023
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1825
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,967
Yeah, there's something a little
bit different about his eyes.

1826
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:22,220
Yes!
I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1827
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,180
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1828
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,640
<i>- Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.</i>

1829
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,058
See that, huh?

1830
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,893
<i>Of all the fucking days,</i>

1831
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,792
<i>she chooses today to
give me blue balls!</i>

1832
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,940
<i>I mean, today was the biggest day
in Stratton's history,</i>

1833
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,859
<i>and I needed to be
thinking straight.</i>

1834
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,337
Hey, Jordan!

1835
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:39,529
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1836
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,759
<i>This was the day that we
launched the Steve Madden IPO.</i>

1837
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,951
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1838
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:46,828
<i>Everything had to run tight.</i>

1839
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:47,954
<i>It had to be perfect.</i>

1840
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,648
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1841
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,859
What's he doing?

1842
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,478
The biggest IPO in
this firm's history.

1843
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,860
What the fuck is he doing?

1844
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,858
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1845
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,242
Hi.

1846
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,428
How're you doing?

1847
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:04,576
Good.

1848
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,287
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1849
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,461
I just... I had a minute and...

1850
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,246
You had a minute.

1851
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,856
And today you needed to
clean the fish bowl? Today?

1852
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:18,632
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1853
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,546
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1854
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:27,845
On new issue day?

1855
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,062
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1856
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,396
This is what you do?

1857
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,357
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1858
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:39,607
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1859
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,130
Take your little bow tie,
get your shit,

1860
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,273
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1861
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,876
Get the fuck out!

1862
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,030
Everybody on point!

1863
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:07,055
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1864
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,288
<i>A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.</i>

1865
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,999
Jordan, look what I caught in
the lobby. I caught a genius.

1866
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,568
<i>Enter Steve Madden.</i>

1867
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,752
The great American cobbler.

1868
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,231
<i>Red-hot ladies footwear Impresario.</i>

1869
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,883
<i>And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.</i>

1870
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:27,705
<i>Stratton Oakmont was crawling
out of the primordial ooze.</i>

1871
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,789
<i>Pond scum no more.</i>

1872
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,349
That's why they gotta
see your face.

1873
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,935
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1874
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,604
<i>And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned</i>

1875
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,958
<i>85% of Steve Madden Shoes,</i>

1876
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,526
<i>which legally speaking
was a big no-no,</i>

1877
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:45,052
<i>but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.</i>

1878
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,634
<i>Our job was to get them worked up.</i>

1879
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,598
<i>- But not too worked up.</i>
- Shh.

1880
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,809
Hello. If, uh...

1881
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:55,475
For those of you who don't know me,
uh...

1882
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:56,833
My name's Steve Madden.

1883
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,668
Yeah, we know who you are.

1884
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,066
Your name is on the box.

1885
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,796
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1886
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,490
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1887
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:06,718
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1888
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,679
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1889
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,347
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1890
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,598
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1891
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:14,667
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1892
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,269
the Mary Lou is actually the same

1893
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,062
as the Mary Jane, but
it's black leather.

1894
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,402
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1895
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,301
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1896
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:28,906
All right!

1897
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:32,285
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1898
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,514
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1899
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,107
Give him a round of applause!

1900
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,436
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1901
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,355
You having a good
afternoon or what?

1902
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,966
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1903
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,365
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1904
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,198
It's because this man

1905
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:54,166
is a creative genius.

1906
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,642
This ability, this gift

1907
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,245
that Steve has,

1908
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,854
it goes beyond just

1909
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,606
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1910
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:05,507
Steve's power is that
he creates trends.

1911
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:06,883
You understand?

1912
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,530
Artists like Steve come along
once every decade.

1913
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:13,034
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1914
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,728
Yves Saint Laurent.

1915
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,847
Steve, come over here for a second.

1916
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,103
I don't think you all realize

1917
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,143
that Steve Madden

1918
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,754
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1919
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,130
with orders going through the roof

1920
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,576
at every department store
in North America right now.

1921
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,070
We have him here in our office!

1922
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,890
We should thank our fucking
lucky stars this man is here!

1923
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,559
We should be
on our hands and knees right now,

1924
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,728
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1925
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,046
Like this! Okay?

1926
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:45,251
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1927
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,719
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1928
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,654
This is our golden ticket

1929
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,781
to the fucking chocolate factory
right here!

1930
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,055
And I wanna meet

1931
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,478
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1932
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,981
I wanna be with the
fucking Oompa Loompas like this!

1933
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,439
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1934
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,366
All right, I want you all
to focus for a second.

1935
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,902
See those little black boxes?

1936
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,177
They're called telephones.

1937
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,055
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1938
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,750
They're not gonna dial themselves.
Okay?

1939
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:22,588
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1940
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:26,800
Like a loaded M16 without a trained
Marine to pull the trigger.

1941
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,257
And in the case of the telephone,

1942
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,048
it's up to each and
every one of you,

1943
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,644
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1944
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:39,058
My killers!

1945
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:43,105
My killers,
who will not take no for an answer!

1946
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,569
My fucking warriors,

1947
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,004
who will not hang up the phone

1948
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:51,048
until their client either buys

1949
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,301
or fucking dies!

1950
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,901
Let me tell you something.

1951
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:13,006
There is no nobility in poverty.

1952
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,449
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1953
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,451
And I choose rich
every fucking time.

1954
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,412
Because at least as a rich man,

1955
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:22,872
when I have to face my problems,

1956
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,832
I show up in the back of a limo,

1957
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,751
wearing a $2,000 suit

1958
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:29,480
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1959
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:34,800
Duke it out! Hit him!

1960
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,323
Get the fuck off me!

1961
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,373
And if anyone here
thinks I'm superficial

1962
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,933
or materialistic,

1963
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:44,310
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1964
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,459
'cause that's where
you fucking belong!

1965
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,044
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1966
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,070
I want you to take a good look

1967
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:55,844
at the person next to you. Go on.

1968
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,218
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1969
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:00,993
you're gonna be pulling
up to a red light

1970
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,062
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1971
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,457
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1972
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,686
in their brand new Porsche

1973
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,504
with their beautiful
wife by their side,

1974
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:13,047
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1975
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,468
And who're you gonna
be sitting next to?

1976
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,303
Some disgusting wildebeest

1977
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,888
with three days of razor-stubble,

1978
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,306
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1979
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,767
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1980
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:26,602
from the fucking Price Club!

1981
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,980
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1982
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,315
So you listen to me
and you listen well.

1983
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,669
Are you behind on your
credit card bills?

1984
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:36,259
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1985
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:39,221
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

1986
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,659
Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1987
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:45,037
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1988
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:47,982
Good! Pick up the
phone and start dialing!

1989
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,436
I want you to deal
with your problems

1990
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:51,711
by becoming rich!

1991
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,756
All you have to do today

1992
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,279
is pick up that phone

1993
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,912
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1994
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,581
And I will make you richer

1995
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,141
than the most powerful CEO

1996
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:06,726
in the United States
of fucking America!

1997
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:08,329
Yeah!

1998
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,418
Fuck, yeah!

1999
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,133
I want you to go out there

2000
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,627
and I want you to ram

2001
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:19,238
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

2002
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,637
until they fucking choke on it!

2003
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,118
Till they choke on it and they buy

2004
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,287
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

2005
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:27,872
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

2006
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,646
You be ferocious!

2007
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,648
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

2008
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:35,068
You be telephone
fucking terrorists!

2009
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:40,051
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

2010
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:15,154
<i>At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.</i>

2011
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:18,361
<i>By 1:03, it was over $18.</i>

2012
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,780
<i>Even the big Wall Street firms
were buying.</i>

2013
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,603
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

2014
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:35,606
a million belonged to me, held in
phony accounts by my ratholes.

2015
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,926
Now once the price hit
the high teens...

2016
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:40,194
You know what? Who gives a shit?

2017
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,922
As always, the point is this.

2018
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:46,760
$22 million in three fucking hours!

2019
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,763
Can you believe this shit?

2020
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:52,248
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

2021
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:53,475
Jordan!

2022
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,126
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

2023
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,877
- from Future Video.
- Who?

2024
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,170
I don't know.
He shot at your wedding.

2025
01:26:58,171 --> 01:26:59,296
He says it's urgent.

2026
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,507
Urgent?
Who the fuck is Barry Kleinman?

2027
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:03,175
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

2028
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:04,301
You're in love with me?

2029
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:05,449
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

2030
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,554
Hey, Barry, what's up?

2031
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,764
Listen, I got this subpoena.

2032
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,307
<i>Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

2033
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:11,892
Yeah, the FBI, they want a copy

2034
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,018
of your wedding video.

2035
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:14,291
<i>The fucking FBI?</i>

2036
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,313
- You fucking kidding me?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

2037
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,690
<i>His name is Denham.</i>

2038
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,442
<i>He's an agent with
the New York office.</i>

2039
01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:20,568
<i>What's his problem?</i>

2040
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,297
<i>He's a Boy Scout. He thinks
you're fucking Gordon Gekko.</i>

2041
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,823
What does he want
with my wedding video?

2042
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,533
It's like an invasion
of my privacy.

2043
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,977
You know what I'm saying?
It's like...

2044
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:30,369
It's intrusive, you know.

2045
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,122
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

2046
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,040
Pictures, names of the people.

2047
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,125
You know what he's trying to do?

2048
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:37,334
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

2049
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,627
He's trying to rattle you,

2050
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,171
he's trying to rattle
your old lady,

2051
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:43,007
so she nags you
until you become a fucking witness.

2052
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,508
He wants me to rat on myself?

2053
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,452
He wants me
to give information about my...

2054
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,345
Listen. The good fucking news is,

2055
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:50,181
you know I know everybody downtown,

2056
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:52,516
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

2057
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:55,712
nobody even knows you fucking
exist, so calm down!

2058
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:57,213
They don't know I exist?

2059
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:59,128
- No.
- That's good.

2060
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,154
But you...

2061
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:06,723
You know who he is, right?

2062
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,408
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

2063
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,452
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

2064
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:14,705
you could go to his house, right?

2065
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,707
Tap his phones a
little bit, bug him.

2066
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:17,875
You could get some information...

2067
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:20,795
You don't fuck with
these guys like that.

2068
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:21,962
You don't fuck with them like that.

2069
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,214
What are you, nuts or something?

2070
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,924
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

2071
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:28,093
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

2072
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,220
I'm not a cop anymore.

2073
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,347
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

2074
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,495
Okay.

2075
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,494
Okay, if I can't do that,
can I just...

2076
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:37,037
Can I give the guy a call?

2077
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,231
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

2078
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:41,315
Do me a favor?

2079
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,318
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

2080
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,402
I can't call him, right?

2081
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:47,238
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

2082
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:48,989
whatever the fuck you say to him,

2083
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,700
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

2084
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,536
He's smart, you're dumb.

2085
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:54,854
Fucking bullshit.

2086
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:56,664
Are we fucking talking tonight,

2087
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:57,915
or are you gonna get schwacked?

2088
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,583
The last time you took
these fucking pills,

2089
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:02,064
you put your head in the fucking
macaroni. I had to pick it up.

2090
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,213
All right.

2091
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:05,941
Okay, I won't call him.

2092
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,845
Hey, fellas! Come on board.

2093
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,698
The plank's right around there.

2094
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:14,825
Welcome!

2095
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,910
Whoo! What a nice day.

2096
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,087
Hey.

2097
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:21,835
Welcome aboard.

2098
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:24,233
Jordan. Welcome aboard the <i>Naomi.</i>

2099
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:25,359
Pleasure to meet you.

2100
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,861
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

2101
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:27,987
Hi, how are you?

2102
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:31,323
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

2103
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,909
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

2104
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,160
These are friends of Stratton.

2105
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:36,433
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

2106
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,727
Um...

2107
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:42,902
Your message said
that you wanted to speak privately.

2108
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,779
Right. I do want to
speak privately.

2109
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,193
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

2110
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,798
Let me know if I can
get you anything.

2111
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,151
We'd be happy to help.

2112
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:50,968
You guys hungry?

2113
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,052
Want something to eat?

2114
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:53,888
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2115
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:56,307
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

2116
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:57,892
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

2117
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,461
to drink while we're at sea.

2118
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:00,704
Duh! Of course.

2119
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,957
Ever been on one of these before?

2120
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,379
A boat?

2121
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,401
I learned how to
sail when I was six.

2122
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,570
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2123
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,363
On one like this, though?

2124
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:14,263
I had the whole front extended in
order to fit the chopper up there.

2125
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:15,681
See that?

2126
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,287
Anyway, this is for you.

2127
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:21,332
It's a complete list of every
person that was at my wedding.

2128
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,168
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2129
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:27,004
Figured this would help
expedite the whole process, right?

2130
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,839
- There you go.
- Look,

2131
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,090
my point is that

2132
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,842
I know you're
investigating Stratton.

2133
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:35,447
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2134
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,932
I know we're a little unorthodox,
we're a little

2135
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,017
loud in the way we do things.
But you gotta understand,

2136
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,393
we're the new guys on the block,
you know,

2137
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:44,043
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2138
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,838
But I want you to
understand, we don't

2139
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,631
do anything illegal.

2140
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,527
Whatsoever.

2141
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,154
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2142
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:55,199
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2143
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,644
I mean, I got...
I got nothing to hide.

2144
01:30:57,744 --> 01:31:00,829
Well, you know the SEC is
a civil regulatory agency.

2145
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,456
We pursue criminal activities.

2146
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,401
Exactly! You go after
real criminals, which

2147
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,379
makes me wonder what the hell
you're investigating me for?

2148
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,403
I mean, honestly...

2149
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:14,426
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2150
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:15,761
Well, I...

2151
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:18,222
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2152
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:20,041
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2153
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:21,580
With that said...

2154
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,228
This case got dumped on my desk...

2155
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:25,896
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2156
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,231
who needs to make a show

2157
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,441
of looking into the new company
on the block,

2158
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:30,919
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2159
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,820
And then I end up being the schmuck

2160
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,571
who does the looking. Exactly.

2161
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,657
It's just, you know...
It bothers me.

2162
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:38,075
We're the new guy. We're the one

2163
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:40,452
that's banging on Wall Street's door.
I mean, you should...

2164
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,413
You should see what's going
on at the bigger firms.

2165
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:44,016
I mean, I know all the information.

2166
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,061
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2167
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,070
Collateralized debt obligations?

2168
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,421
This Internet stock bullshit?

2169
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:52,297
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2170
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,550
I could take you step-by-step

2171
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:57,370
through what exactly is occurring.

2172
01:31:57,554 --> 01:31:59,247
All you have to do is ask.

2173
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,702
I'm available.

2174
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,433
- That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
- Mmm-hmm.

2175
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:05,413
I don't see why a
little sitdown like this

2176
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:07,604
can't be profitable
for the both of us.

2177
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,940
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2178
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,588
- It should.
- Look.

2179
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,319
I'm gonna give you
my personal line.

2180
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,344
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2181
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,267
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2182
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:23,495
Are you sure you guys don't
want something to drink?

2183
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:25,247
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2184
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,975
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2185
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:31,128
Let me ask you,

2186
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,629
and if you don't wanna
get too personal,

2187
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,903
- just tell me to shut up at any time.
- Oh.

2188
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:38,552
Did you try to get
your broker's license at one time?

2189
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:41,497
Did I hear that right? Were you
trying to take a stab at Wall Street?

2190
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,308
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2191
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,392
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2192
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,518
Well, you're investigating me.

2193
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,062
I hear things.

2194
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,506
You know what I mean?

2195
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,066
You ever think about
what would've happened

2196
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,761
if you would have
stayed the course?

2197
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:57,821
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2198
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,198
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2199
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,075
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2200
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,659
Yeah, you bet I do.

2201
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,495
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2202
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:05,621
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2203
01:33:05,622 --> 01:33:06,789
What do you get...

2204
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,123
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2205
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:09,583
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2206
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:12,733
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2207
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:14,838
- A year? In the ballpark?
- Oh.

2208
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,381
Well, I...

2209
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:18,258
Let's put it this way.

2210
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:19,551
You get a free handgun

2211
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,432
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2212
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:24,014
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2213
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,266
You think about the people
that built this country,

2214
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:27,768
hardworking people like you.

2215
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:30,418
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2216
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:34,191
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2217
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,151
It fucking makes me angry.

2218
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:39,301
Now the one thing about Wall Street
and this market is,

2219
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:41,095
for me, I feel

2220
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,493
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2221
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,745
There are situations where I can

2222
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:50,374
make those situations better
for people. You know?

2223
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,750
You know what I mean.

2224
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,273
Opportunity

2225
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:54,795
is everything.

2226
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:56,148
Exactly.

2227
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:58,715
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2228
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:02,553
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2229
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,471
He was bogged down
by student loans.

2230
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,974
Turns out, his mother needed
triple bypass surgery.

2231
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:08,725
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2232
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:09,810
Sure.

2233
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:10,978
But we got him into the market

2234
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:12,729
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2235
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,565
We gave him the right guidance.

2236
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:17,340
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2237
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,486
Got to put his mother into

2238
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:21,321
the best hospital in New York City.

2239
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:22,489
It didn't work out for her,

2240
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,283
granted, she passed
away, unfortunately.

2241
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,243
But we gave him that opportunity.

2242
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:27,516
You know what I'm saying?

2243
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:29,913
It's just about setting
up the right team,

2244
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,767
and then overnight
your life can change.

2245
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:40,570
What does... What does an intern...

2246
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,927
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

2247
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:46,076
Well, in that situation,

2248
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:50,080
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2249
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,917
north of half a million dollars.

2250
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:58,775
And I'd do that for
anybody, you know,

2251
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:01,550
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

2252
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:23,359
Can you say that again,

2253
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,286
just the way you said it?

2254
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:27,580
Just the same way.

2255
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:30,457
Oh.

2256
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:32,809
I don't know what
you're talking about.

2257
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,753
Oh, come on!
You know what I'm talking about.

2258
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,253
I think what Jordan
just did is he...

2259
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:38,482
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2260
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:40,692
you just tried to
bribe a federal officer.

2261
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:42,861
No, technically I
didn't bribe anybody.

2262
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:45,364
No, no, that's not the conversation
I heard, Jordan.

2263
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:46,949
No, no, according to
the U.S. criminal code,

2264
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,867
there needs to be an
exact dollar figure

2265
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,452
- for the exchange of services.
- Oh!

2266
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,162
That would not hold
up in a court of law.

2267
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:53,914
Nah, it's not howl heard it.

2268
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:56,667
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2269
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:57,793
Yeah.

2270
01:35:57,794 --> 01:35:59,378
The same gentleman that told me

2271
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,213
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2272
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,442
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2273
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:05,008
He ran a security check on me.

2274
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,235
Well...

2275
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:09,388
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2276
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:11,617
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2277
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,851
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2278
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:16,920
What do you say? Hmm?

2279
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,522
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2280
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:21,627
Most of the Wall Street jackasses
that I bust,

2281
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:24,403
they're to the manor born.

2282
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:25,570
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2283
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,281
Their fathers are douchebags,

2284
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,305
just like their
fathers before them.

2285
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,803
But you...

2286
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,852
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2287
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,141
Did I?

2288
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,314
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2289
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:40,711
Good for you.

2290
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:41,962
Me, the little man?

2291
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:43,088
And let me tell you something.

2292
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:45,157
Let me tell you something else.

2293
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:47,384
Honestly,
I'm not bullshitting here,

2294
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:48,552
this is one of the nicest boats

2295
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:50,679
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2296
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,360
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2297
01:36:52,598 --> 01:36:55,600
The fucking hero that I'm
gonna be back at the office

2298
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:57,874
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2299
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,147
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2300
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,815
look at this thing!

2301
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:02,899
It's beautiful!

2302
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,986
And you got the beautiful
girls there. It's wonderful.

2303
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:08,510
All right, get the
fuck off my boat.

2304
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:10,240
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2305
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,366
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

2306
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:12,909
Good luck on that subway ride home

2307
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,911
to your miserable,
ugly fucking wives.

2308
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:18,081
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some
caviar off my balls in the meantime.

2309
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:20,834
Hey, you guys want to take some
lobsters for your ride home?

2310
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:23,545
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2311
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:25,444
Fucking cheap fucks.

2312
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,030
Fucking miserable pricks.

2313
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:31,345
Hey, fellas! Look what I
found in my pocket! Look!

2314
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,180
A year's salary right here.

2315
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:35,932
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2316
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:37,285
See that!

2317
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:39,829
They're fun coupons!

2318
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,389
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2319
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:52,491
<i>Swiss fucking banks, that's what.</i>

2320
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:55,266
<i>It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.</i>

2321
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,056
<i>Enter Rugrat.</i>

2322
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,790
<i>He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.</i>

2323
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:00,957
That's for European pussy!

2324
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,292
<i>But he was in Geneva.</i>

2325
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,737
<i>And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.</i>

2326
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,215
<i>So I knew if I took my drugs right,</i>

2327
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,364
<i>I could sleep through
the entire flight.</i>

2328
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:13,120
<i>But I had to take them just right.</i>

2329
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,740
<i>At 4:00 p.m., I popped
a few more ludes,</i>

2330
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:17,307
<i>which started kicking
in by the time</i>

2331
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,160
<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i>

2332
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,627
<i>My tingle phase.</i>

2333
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:22,604
<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i>

2334
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:25,629
<i>on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.</i>

2335
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:27,259
<i>My slur phase.</i>

2336
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,764
<i>By 8:30, I took a few more ludes</i>

2337
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,600
<i>and pretty much lost
all my motor skills.</i>

2338
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,344
<i>This was the drool phase.</i>

2339
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:42,749
<i>And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.</i>

2340
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,443
<i>The amnesia phase.</i>

2341
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,295
<i>We boarded the plane
just before midnight.</i>

2342
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:49,089
Wow! Look at you!

2343
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,158
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2344
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:53,510
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2345
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,137
May I see your
boarding passes, sir?

2346
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:56,956
We have the boarding passes.

2347
01:38:57,014 --> 01:38:59,116
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2348
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,460
Hey! Fucking relax.

2349
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,687
Oh, my God! You got your
hand on my fucking cock!

2350
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,147
I don't. Cut it out.

2351
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:06,189
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2352
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,315
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2353
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:08,608
You got your hand on his dick?

2354
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,632
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2355
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:12,721
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2356
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:13,989
Take it off!

2357
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:17,060
I heard there's a treasure map
under here.

2358
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,453
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2359
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,976
Please sit down.

2360
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:22,539
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2361
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,938
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2362
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:26,877
I will have to call the captain.

2363
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:29,504
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2364
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,256
- Please sit down!
- Ow!

2365
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:32,883
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2366
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:34,577
We apologize.
We're gonna go to sleep.

2367
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,077
Question. I wanna
ask you a question.

2368
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:37,492
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2369
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,723
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2370
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:40,849
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2371
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,058
Sit down. Fasten it.

2372
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,643
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2373
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:44,728
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2374
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:45,979
You gotta speak English.

2375
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,023
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2376
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,626
I will help him with his seat belt.

2377
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,896
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2378
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,988
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2379
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,014
<i>Bitte, Hilfe!</i>

2380
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:15,592
Jesus Christ!

2381
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:17,070
Fuck!

2382
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:20,096
Donnie...

2383
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,326
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2384
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,644
I can't untie you.

2385
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:27,020
The captain tied you up.

2386
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:28,589
He almost fucking tasered you.

2387
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,587
Why?

2388
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:31,963
Why?

2389
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:34,886
He's got a fear of flying.

2390
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:37,549
Ah!

2391
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,784
He's very nervous
on planes, I'm sorry,

2392
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,808
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2393
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:45,807
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2394
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:48,124
You were screaming at people.

2395
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,584
Oh, fuck off.

2396
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:51,795
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2397
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:52,921
Oh, Jesus.

2398
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,090
You called the captain the N-word.

2399
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:56,675
I called the captain the N-word?

2400
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:59,199
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2401
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,747
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2402
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:05,410
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2403
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,957
Where are the ludes?

2404
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,080
Where are the ludes?

2405
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:11,606
They're up my ass.
Don't worry about it.

2406
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:13,316
- I got it.
- Okay.

2407
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:15,010
Thank God.

2408
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:16,778
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do

2409
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:17,904
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2410
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:18,989
This is bad.

2411
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,991
Fucking things are against my
chest. I can't breathe.

2412
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:22,701
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2413
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:24,536
Okay, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

2414
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:26,980
Okay. Shh! Shh!

2415
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:29,165
That's good.

2416
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,959
- Go to sleep.
- Rub it harder, buddy.

2417
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,653
You're all right.

2418
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:35,235
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2419
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:42,322
Mr. Belfort,

2420
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:43,952
you're free to go.

2421
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:47,122
Really?

2422
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:51,187
Whoo!

2423
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:52,397
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2424
01:41:52,398 --> 01:41:54,190
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2425
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:56,359
Okay? Let's make Geneva an
asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2426
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,819
What are you
fucking coming at me for?

2427
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,446
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2428
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,072
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2429
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:02,157
<i>Hilfe!</i>

2430
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,849
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2431
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:07,809
Jordan Belfort!

2432
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:09,039
At last.

2433
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,768
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

2434
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:13,853
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2435
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,119
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2436
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:18,173
It's a joke.

2437
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:20,527
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2438
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,302
You need a bigger couch.
For guests.

2439
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,262
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2440
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:27,207
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2441
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:32,000
Uh... Wait. Yes.
Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2442
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,629
Swiss custom requires
10 minutes of...

2443
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,733
Blah, blah, blah.

2444
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,443
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2445
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:40,171
before business can be discussed.

2446
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:42,840
Yeah.

2447
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:46,681
Of course.

2448
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:50,143
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2449
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,541
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2450
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,815
to cooperate with an FBI

2451
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:59,282
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2452
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,071
<i>Ca depend.</i>

2453
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:02,864
<i>Ca depend?</i>

2454
01:43:03,386 --> 01:43:04,487
<i>Oui.</i>

2455
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:07,661
Ca depend on what, exactly?

2456
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,684
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2457
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:12,628
in the coming months.

2458
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:15,021
Shall I check if tanks are
rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2459
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:17,216
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2460
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:20,235
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy.
It's Croix.

2461
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:22,529
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2462
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,364
- Champagne. Champagne.
- Yeah.

2463
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:26,342
Yeah, yeah. French
fries, pommes frites.

2464
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:30,142
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2465
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:34,207
<i>What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,</i>

2466
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,606
<i>is are you going to fuck me over?</i>

2467
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,905
<i>I understand
perfectly, you American shit.</i>

2468
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,429
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genéve

2469
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,624
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2470
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,599
is if the crime being pursued

2471
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,873
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2472
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:58,481
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2473
01:43:58,482 --> 01:43:59,649
Hmm.

2474
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,359
From a financial standpoint,

2475
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,803
you are now

2476
01:44:03,112 --> 01:44:04,555
in heaven.

2477
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:06,590
See, I told you he was
fantastic, right?

2478
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:11,892
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2479
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:13,723
<i>papier toilette.</i>

2480
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:16,249
We would wipe our ass with it.

2481
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,336
Unless, of course, it
was an investigation

2482
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:22,255
into stock fraud,

2483
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:24,507
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

2484
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:28,613
Then there would have to
be <i>coopération</i> on your part,

2485
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:30,284
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2486
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:33,288
Yes, we would. Mmm-hmm.

2487
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,828
Assuming the account is
under your name.

2488
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,706
If it were

2489
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:40,253
another name,

2490
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:43,193
a friend's, camarade...

2491
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:44,420
Cousin?

2492
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,726
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2493
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:52,469
Hmm.

2494
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:55,556
<i>Was that yodeling I just heard</i>

2495
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:58,124
<i>or did you just say
what I thought you said?</i>

2496
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,977
Yes. Yes.

2497
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:03,277
<i>He's telling me
to use a fucking rathole.</i>

2498
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,131
<i>But a U.S. rathole would never get</i>

2499
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,425
<i>into Switzerland
with all that money.</i>

2500
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:11,372
<i>What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.</i>

2501
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,063
Jordan.

2502
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:23,024
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2503
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,526
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2504
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,174
Oh, no, not at all.

2505
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:30,341
Jordan, come in.

2506
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:33,010
<i>Thank God Aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.</i>

2507
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:36,180
<i>Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.</i>

2508
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,725
<i>Money talks and
bullshit takes the bus.</i>

2509
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,231
<i>How do you say
"rathole" in British?</i>

2510
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:44,087
If you get into any
trouble whatsoever,

2511
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,923
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2512
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,321
That I promise.

2513
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:51,654
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2514
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,831
Sometimes I wonder

2515
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:01,145
if you let money get the
best of you, my love.

2516
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:02,372
Among

2517
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:04,378
other substances.

2518
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:06,877
Oh.

2519
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,154
It's that obvious, huh?

2520
01:46:10,155 --> 01:46:13,509
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2521
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,063
What can I say? I'm...

2522
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,604
I'm a drug addict.

2523
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,067
I really am.

2524
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,854
Cocaine, pills.

2525
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,777
Whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2526
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:30,008
Now that's the truth.

2527
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,342
I mean...

2528
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:32,820
I'm a sex addict, too.

2529
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,139
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2530
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:39,809
Jesus, why am I telling
you all this? Why am I...

2531
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,537
I'm sorry.

2532
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:44,506
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2533
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:47,592
- You are. You are easy to talk to.
- Mmm.

2534
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:50,153
I suppose it's...

2535
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,676
Just my job, you know.

2536
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,574
All these people dependent on me.

2537
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:57,474
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2538
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,454
Sometimes I feel like I...

2539
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:02,729
I've bitten off more
than I can chew, you know.

2540
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:04,935
You're a man with large appetites.

2541
01:47:05,294 --> 01:47:06,486
Yeah.

2542
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:10,111
<i>Is she fucking hitting on me?</i>

2543
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,488
Yeah.

2544
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:12,905
Yeah, I am.

2545
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:18,328
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2546
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,496
My decision.

2547
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:22,435
It's just hard to...

2548
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:26,461
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2549
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,588
You know, to...

2550
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:31,678
Learn to relax and let go and...

2551
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:34,465
To release the tension.

2552
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,975
<i>She is hitting on me.</i>

2553
01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:39,348
<i>Holy shit!</i>

2554
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:41,809
Yeah, to release the tension.

2555
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,478
I suppose we, uh...

2556
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,364
We all just need to learn, uh...

2557
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:54,281
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

2558
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,664
<i>Is he fucking hitting on me?</i>

2559
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,521
Stability, dear.

2560
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:08,044
Family.

2561
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:16,845
You take care of my niece, my love.

2562
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:19,305
I'll take care of
everything over here.

2563
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,428
Deal.

2564
01:48:23,956 --> 01:48:26,650
Come on! There you go.

2565
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:28,026
Whoo!

2566
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,522
<i>We had, literally,
a fuckload of money.</i>

2567
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:34,024
<i>Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.</i>

2568
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:38,533
<i>So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?</i>

2569
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:40,596
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2570
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:43,474
<i>Now Brad, as a
successful drug dealer,</i>

2571
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:45,768
<i>spent his winters in
the south of France,</i>

2572
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,895
<i>which is where he met
his wife, Chantalle,</i>

2573
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:50,875
<i>a stripper of Slovenian origin</i>

2574
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:52,463
<i>born, in of all places,</i>

2575
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:54,545
<i>Switzerland.</i>

2576
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:00,388
Well, this is fucked.

2577
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:02,511
Oh. No shit.

2578
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:09,018
Like, this will take
her like 50 trips.

2579
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:10,269
I know.

2580
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:15,073
Let me ask you something?

2581
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,759
What about her family? Right?

2582
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,511
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, fight

2583
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,472
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2584
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,474
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2585
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,476
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2586
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,144
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2587
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:29,479
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2588
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:32,023
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2589
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:34,968
Hey, uh, don't forget
about my money.

2590
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:37,820
I'm sorry, what's that?

2591
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,363
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2592
01:49:39,364 --> 01:49:41,512
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2593
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:44,077
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2594
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,772
When it gets in, I'll give you
a call, you come pick it up.

2595
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,813
You give me a call?

2596
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:55,671
When it gets here, I'll give you a
call and you'll come pick it up.

2597
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:57,445
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2598
01:49:57,466 --> 01:49:58,988
Sweetheart,

2599
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:01,052
you have my money
taped to your tits.

2600
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:03,155
Okay? Technically,
you do work for me.

2601
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,793
Hey, Jordan,
we're gonna need to talk.

2602
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:09,519
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2603
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,561
I ain't going to him, okay.

2604
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:11,687
- I'm not a fucking <i>shvartze.</i>
- I got it.

2605
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:13,064
I don't do fucking
pickups, all right?

2606
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:14,190
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2607
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:15,858
We meet someplace
that I fucking say.

2608
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:17,318
And you tell that
fucking piece of shit,

2609
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:18,569
- he comes correct.
- I will.

2610
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,947
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2611
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,865
I'll mash that
douchebag's teeth in.

2612
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:24,700
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2613
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,494
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2614
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:28,871
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2615
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:30,790
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2616
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,875
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2617
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,168
I put that money in there!

2618
01:50:34,169 --> 01:50:35,795
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2619
01:50:35,796 --> 01:50:38,172
I got five more just like you, bro.

2620
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:39,966
Keep talking,
you fucking piece of shit!

2621
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:41,801
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2622
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:42,885
So fuck you!

2623
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:44,720
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2624
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,823
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2625
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,659
You okay? Hey, pal.

2626
01:50:51,186 --> 01:50:54,063
<i>The next day,
Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.</i>

2627
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,482
<i>Two million in cash
in her carry-on,</i>

2628
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:57,900
<i>which in the big picture</i>

2629
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,628
<i>was a drop in the Swiss bucket.</i>

2630
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:02,071
<i>'Cause the following month,</i>

2631
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:04,031
<i>over the course of six round trips,</i>

2632
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:05,741
<i>Chantalle's family and friends</i>

2633
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:08,161
<i>smuggled in over 20 million in cash</i>

2634
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:10,014
<i>without even a hiccup.</i>

2635
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:16,919
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2636
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,212
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2637
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,422
<i>And here.</i>

2638
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:20,715
Welcome.

2639
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:21,883
<i>Welcome.</i>

2640
01:51:21,884 --> 01:51:24,177
- Yeah, like four bags of it.
- Ooh!

2641
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:27,805
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2642
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:29,432
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2643
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,808
Who cares. You're blonde.

2644
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:31,910
Oh, stop.

2645
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:53,789
Shit.

2646
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:57,023
Just put the fucking car in
park, you dumb fucking idiot!

2647
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,171
I can't close this briefcase.

2648
01:52:00,172 --> 01:52:01,631
One fucking day.

2649
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,674
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2650
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:05,368
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2651
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:08,530
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2652
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:14,852
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2653
01:52:14,853 --> 01:52:16,896
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2654
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:17,980
It's a fucking joke.

2655
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,649
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2656
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,192
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2657
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:23,110
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2658
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:25,863
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2659
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:28,032
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2660
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:30,493
With smart important
people, unlike you.

2661
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:32,870
People who don't
sucker-punch people

2662
01:52:32,871 --> 01:52:34,455
when they're scared. Okay?

2663
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:35,915
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2664
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:36,999
I haven't gotten an
apology yet for that.

2665
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,125
You want an apology, okay.

2666
01:52:38,126 --> 01:52:39,669
I check my fucking
messages every day

2667
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,753
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2668
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:42,004
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2669
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,130
I got a blinking light,

2670
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:44,507
because I don't have shit from you.

2671
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,800
You know what,
you got a big fucking mouth, okay?

2672
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,134
I got my wife checking the messages

2673
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:49,220
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2674
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:50,513
"Has Brad apologized yet?

2675
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,598
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2676
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,225
I don't have jack shit.
You know what?

2677
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:55,726
That's not how you treat people.

2678
01:52:55,727 --> 01:52:56,852
You got a big fucking
mouth, you know.

2679
01:52:56,853 --> 01:52:58,604
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2680
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:00,898
You're gonna give me a pass?

2681
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:02,566
Look, it's a figure
of fucking speech.

2682
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,610
Oh, my gosh.
The Emperor of Fucksville

2683
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:05,987
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2684
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:07,071
From Fucksville, huh?

2685
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:09,031
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2686
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,574
when their Emperor's gone?

2687
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:12,201
Is it mayhem?

2688
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,078
Are people looting and raping?

2689
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:16,163
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2690
01:53:16,164 --> 01:53:17,665
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2691
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:19,041
You back the fuck up.

2692
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,293
I'll cause the biggest
fucking scene

2693
01:53:20,294 --> 01:53:22,586
that I've ever caused in my life

2694
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,422
if you come at me again.

2695
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:26,090
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2696
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:27,383
I got...

2697
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:28,968
I don't wanna be out
of line or anything,

2698
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:32,054
but I think you like,
like me. Like you...

2699
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:33,597
Like when you come at me...

2700
01:53:33,598 --> 01:53:34,765
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2701
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:36,267
and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2702
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:38,060
You have like a fucking, like...

2703
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:40,146
Like a twinkle.
You have like a twinkle.

2704
01:53:40,147 --> 01:53:41,689
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2705
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,357
Jesus fucking Christ.

2706
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:45,401
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2707
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:47,194
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2708
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:48,988
You're just not the
one for me, pal.

2709
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,197
You know what I mean? It's not...

2710
01:53:50,198 --> 01:53:52,199
- it's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2711
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,702
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2712
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:56,162
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2713
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,621
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2714
01:53:57,622 --> 01:53:59,373
You gotta take this case,

2715
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,000
you gotta drive straight home,

2716
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,668
need you to open up the briefcase,

2717
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:04,587
and you take out
every single dollar.

2718
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,630
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2719
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:07,840
And once you have it all

2720
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,717
neatly organized
outside the briefcase,

2721
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:12,094
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2722
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,263
your wife's Latvian
cunt, you understand?

2723
01:54:14,264 --> 01:54:16,015
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2724
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:17,558
Fuck. You motherfucking
piece of shit!

2725
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:18,768
How about now?

2726
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:20,227
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2727
01:54:21,897 --> 01:54:23,689
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2728
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,441
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2729
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:28,386
Stop, or I will blow
you the fuck away!

2730
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,946
Drop the case! Put
your hands in the air!

2731
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:32,865
Get down.

2732
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:34,718
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2733
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:36,849
Motherfucker!

2734
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:39,936
Motherfucker!

2735
01:54:48,632 --> 01:54:52,301
Jordan, do I have a
surprise for you!

2736
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:53,511
What's that?

2737
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:55,137
Twenty real Lemmons.

2738
01:54:55,138 --> 01:54:56,389
Retired pharmacist's
client of mine,

2739
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,640
they've been in the
safe for 15 years.

2740
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,141
Are you fucking kidding me?
Lemmons?

2741
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:00,351
Ha-ha!

2742
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:02,311
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2743
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,105
<i>When it comes to Quaaludes,</i>

2744
01:55:04,106 --> 01:55:07,316
<i>the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.</i>

2745
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,901
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

2746
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:10,444
I thought they were like a myth.

2747
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:12,405
<i>Three times as powerful
as anything available today.</i>

2748
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,531
Look at these babies.

2749
01:55:13,532 --> 01:55:16,200
<i>Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.</i>

2750
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:18,369
<i>He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.</i>

2751
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,038
<i>Like a birthday, or
being clap free,</i>

2752
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:24,109
<i>or our money arriving safely
in Switzerland.</i>

2753
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:28,754
<i>So that night,</i>

2754
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,673
<i>I cleared my schedule
and I rid my body</i>

2755
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,277
<i>of anything that
could fuck with my high.</i>

2756
01:55:33,885 --> 01:55:35,783
<i>It was celebration time.</i>

2757
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:37,513
Okay.

2758
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:39,098
Start off with one,
see how it goes?

2759
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:40,933
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2760
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,456
Here you go.

2761
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:44,812
- Salud!
- Cheers.

2762
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:47,712
<i>Maybe if I pull it
again, it'll go down.</i>

2763
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:50,693
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

2764
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:52,027
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i>

2765
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,988
<i>Carl, I think I got it figured out.</i>

2766
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:57,783
<i>It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.</i>

2767
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,136
<i>Okay.</i>

2768
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:09,275
Do you feel anything?

2769
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,112
No.

2770
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:17,636
It's been 35 minutes.

2771
01:56:17,637 --> 01:56:18,863
Hmm.

2772
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,557
Maybe we've built up a tolerance

2773
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:23,706
after all these years, huh?

2774
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,746
Hmm.

2775
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,240
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

2776
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:41,494
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2777
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,745
They're old.

2778
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:44,997
You think they lost
their potency, huh?

2779
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,725
Check the bottle!

2780
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:50,961
January '81.

2781
01:56:50,962 --> 01:56:52,129
They're fucking duds.

2782
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:53,255
Fuck!

2783
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:54,423
Let's take, uh...

2784
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:56,026
Let's take two more each.

2785
01:56:57,886 --> 01:57:00,535
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2786
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,893
What are you two retards doing?

2787
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:07,211
We're working out, honey.

2788
01:57:07,437 --> 01:57:09,104
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2789
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:10,189
Okay.

2790
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:12,213
- Okay?
- Okay

2791
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,236
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2792
01:57:15,237 --> 01:57:16,445
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2793
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:17,905
I cannot talk to you on this phone,

2794
01:57:17,906 --> 01:57:19,114
I have to talk to you.

2795
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:20,699
<i>Get out of here.
What's going on?</i>

2796
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:24,119
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2797
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,871
and then call me from a pay phone.

2798
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:27,915
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2799
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:29,643
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2800
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:31,460
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2801
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:32,920
I don't know what the
fuck's going on.

2802
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:34,989
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

2803
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:47,142
<i>The closest pay
phone I could get to</i>

2804
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:49,541
<i>was at the Brookville Country Club.</i>

2805
01:57:50,105 --> 01:57:52,147
<i>It was a real WASP stronghold,</i>

2806
01:57:52,148 --> 01:57:54,842
<i>just a mile down the road
from my house.</i>

2807
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,703
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2808
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:06,829
I'm at a pay phone.
What's going on?

2809
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:08,038
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

2810
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:09,915
Please. Your little
friend there, Brad,

2811
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:11,893
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2812
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,836
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2813
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,379
<i>- What'd he do?
- I don't know what he did.</i>

2814
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:16,797
My friends in Long Island told me

2815
01:58:16,798 --> 01:58:19,091
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2816
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:20,175
He got locked up by...

2817
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:22,511
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2818
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:23,887
- Yeah.
- He was with Donnie.

2819
01:58:23,888 --> 01:58:25,472
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

2820
01:58:25,473 --> 01:58:26,974
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
<i>- Listen to me!</i>

2821
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:28,017
I gotta go fucking
talk to him right now!

2822
01:58:28,018 --> 01:58:30,060
Listen to me! Don't go!
Listen to me.

2823
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:32,771
That guy Denham,
that FBI agent guy,

2824
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:35,149
somebody told me he's got
your phones tapped.

2825
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,734
Your office and your home.

2826
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:38,527
<i>Don't talk on the
motherfucking phone!</i>

2827
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:40,551
Okay. Fuck! I got it.
I got it. I got it.

2828
01:58:40,905 --> 01:58:42,131
<i>Jordan.</i>

2829
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:46,452
You didn't try to bribe this
fucking FBI agent, did you?

2830
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:48,579
No, I didn't try to
bribe an FBI agent.

2831
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,205
You think I'm that fucking stupid?
No.

2832
01:58:50,206 --> 01:58:52,166
<i>What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.</i>

2833
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:53,417
<i>Say that again.</i>

2834
01:58:53,418 --> 01:58:56,317
I said...

2835
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,297
<i>What the fuck are you saying?</i>

2836
01:58:59,382 --> 01:59:00,466
I said...

2837
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:02,009
<i>Are you fucking high?</i>

2838
01:59:04,554 --> 01:59:07,282
<i>Jordan, are you fucking high?</i>

2839
01:59:08,016 --> 01:59:10,225
<i>Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.</i>

2840
01:59:10,226 --> 01:59:11,935
<i>Don't get behind the
wheel of the car.</i>

2841
01:59:11,936 --> 01:59:13,562
<i>I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.</i>

2842
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:14,897
<i>Jordan! Jordan!</i>

2843
01:59:14,898 --> 01:59:17,232
<i>After 15 years in storage,</i>

2844
01:59:17,233 --> 01:59:20,277
<i>the Lemmons had developed
a delayed fuse.</i>

2845
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:23,030
<i>It took 90 minutes for these
little fuckers to kick in.</i>

2846
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,448
<i>But once they did...</i>

2847
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:25,949
<i>Pow!</i>

2848
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:27,576
<i>I mean, I had skipped
the tingle phase</i>

2849
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:29,578
<i>and went straight
to the drool phase.</i>

2850
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:31,622
<i>Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...</i>

2851
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:33,624
<i>These little bastards
were so strong,</i>

2852
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,751
<i>I discovered a whole new phase.</i>

2853
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:37,900
<i>The cerebral palsy phase.</i>

2854
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,192
<i>Come on, stand up!</i>

2855
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:48,077
<i>Okay, walking's out.</i>

2856
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:51,911
<i>All right, think, think.
What else is there?</i>

2857
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:56,465
<i>Yes! I can crawl.
I can crawl like Skylar!</i>

2858
02:00:28,012 --> 02:00:31,082
<i>Fuck! The kid makes it
look so goddamn easy!</i>

2859
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:40,482
<i>Think, you motherfucker, think!</i>

2860
02:00:40,483 --> 02:00:41,900
<i>Yes!</i>

2861
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:44,095
<i>I got it! I've got it!</i>

2862
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:46,677
<i>I can roll! I can roll!</i>

2863
02:01:34,746 --> 02:01:35,972
Ah!

2864
02:01:54,224 --> 02:01:55,416
Ah!

2865
02:02:08,905 --> 02:02:10,239
Jordan.

2866
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:13,184
<i>Jordan.</i>

2867
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:15,202
<i>Oh, Jesus. Where are you?</i>

2868
02:02:15,203 --> 02:02:16,745
I'm at a country club!

2869
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:17,871
<i>What?</i>

2870
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:20,791
I'm at a country club!

2871
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:22,209
<i>I don't know what the
fuck you're saying.</i>

2872
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:23,544
<i>Look, you need to get home.</i>

2873
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:26,255
<i>Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line</i>

2874
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:28,215
<i>with some Swiss guy.
I don't know...</i>

2875
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:29,299
What?

2876
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,370
Get him off the phone!

2877
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:35,430
<i>I can't understand you!</i>

2878
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:36,765
Get him

2879
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:37,891
off

2880
02:02:37,892 --> 02:02:39,101
the phone!

2881
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,435
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.</i>

2882
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:41,854
<i>Can you just get home? Hurry!</i>

2883
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:53,824
<i>I was less than a mile from home.</i>

2884
02:02:53,825 --> 02:02:56,618
<i>I drove as slow as I fucking could.</i>

2885
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:58,704
<i>I'd seen Jell-O move faster.</i>

2886
02:02:58,705 --> 02:03:01,228
<i>I was gonna give you 2 million.</i>

2887
02:03:01,291 --> 02:03:03,940
I's gonna be lates.

2888
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:06,195
You ate 2 million?

2889
02:03:07,005 --> 02:03:08,338
Later.

2890
02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:09,548
<i>Get off the phone.</i>

2891
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,133
<i>Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!</i>

2892
02:03:12,427 --> 02:03:14,621
Get out of the way, asshole!

2893
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:18,515
You hate 2 million?

2894
02:03:18,516 --> 02:03:20,118
No, you don't hate
2 million, Donnie.

2895
02:03:22,562 --> 02:03:25,522
<i>By some miracle,
I made it home alive,</i>

2896
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,921
<i>not a scratch on me or the car.</i>

2897
02:03:37,243 --> 02:03:38,827
Jordan?

2898
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:41,496
Jesus fucking Christ!

2899
02:03:41,497 --> 02:03:43,081
What did you take?

2900
02:03:43,082 --> 02:03:44,458
What's wrong with you?

2901
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:45,542
Jor!

2902
02:03:45,543 --> 02:03:48,003
It's fucking good, right?

2903
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:49,379
Fucked up!

2904
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:52,616
Get off the phone!

2905
02:03:55,553 --> 02:03:57,846
What the fuck, Jordan?

2906
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,514
Your daughter's in the house!

2907
02:03:59,515 --> 02:04:00,682
I hope you know that!

2908
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:02,059
Your fucking daughter's
in the house!

2909
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,061
Yeah, it's real fucking
funny, Donnie.

2910
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:06,521
Get off the phone!

2911
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:08,690
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2912
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:10,464
The FBI!

2913
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:13,046
Hey!

2914
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:15,465
I'm on phone!

2915
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:18,051
Get off the fucking phone!

2916
02:04:19,702 --> 02:04:21,804
- Come here!
- ...the phone.

2917
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:27,019
Come on.
We're gonna go upstairs, all right.

2918
02:04:28,878 --> 02:04:30,070
Ow!

2919
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:33,382
I'm on the phone!

2920
02:04:33,383 --> 02:04:34,800
On the phone!

2921
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:36,995
I know what you did,

2922
02:04:37,387 --> 02:04:38,887
you piece of shit!

2923
02:04:38,888 --> 02:04:40,681
What? What?

2924
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:42,125
Brad!

2925
02:04:42,475 --> 02:04:43,725
Huh?

2926
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:45,294
Brad!

2927
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:46,979
Brad!

2928
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,503
You fucking cocksucker!

2929
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,696
What did you do,

2930
02:04:55,697 --> 02:04:57,572
you piece of shit?

2931
02:04:57,573 --> 02:04:59,095
Fuck you!

2932
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:02,619
I wanna fucking kill you!

2933
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,893
I wanna fucking kill you!

2934
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:07,191
I got you!

2935
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:33,672
What the fuck happened?

2936
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,360
Oh, shit!

2937
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:37,338
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2938
02:05:37,405 --> 02:05:39,098
Donnie? Donnie?

2939
02:05:39,323 --> 02:05:40,490
Donnie?

2940
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:41,908
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2941
02:05:41,909 --> 02:05:43,785
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2942
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:45,120
Jordan, I don't know
what the fuck to do!

2943
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:46,768
I can't help him!
Oh, my God. Jordan.

2944
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:51,126
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2945
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:52,979
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2946
02:05:53,463 --> 02:05:56,442
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2947
02:05:57,258 --> 02:05:59,656
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2948
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:01,470
<i>Ah!</i>

2949
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:02,888
I got you.

2950
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:20,798
Oh!

2951
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:23,851
Step aside!

2952
02:06:23,993 --> 02:06:25,470
Oh, God!

2953
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:27,396
Oh, God!

2954
02:06:27,663 --> 02:06:29,515
Move aside, baby.

2955
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:38,256
Come on! Come on!

2956
02:06:38,257 --> 02:06:39,574
Come on!

2957
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,787
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2958
02:06:47,725 --> 02:06:49,851
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2959
02:06:49,852 --> 02:06:51,625
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2960
02:06:57,193 --> 02:06:58,360
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2961
02:06:58,361 --> 02:07:00,362
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2962
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:01,613
I don't fucking know!

2963
02:07:01,614 --> 02:07:03,406
Just get over here! Call 911.

2964
02:07:11,415 --> 02:07:12,516
Yeah.

2965
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,404
You all right? He's all right.

2966
02:07:29,517 --> 02:07:31,711
Mr. Belfort?

2967
02:07:32,562 --> 02:07:34,130
Mr. Belfort?

2968
02:07:36,691 --> 02:07:39,693
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck.

2969
02:07:39,694 --> 02:07:42,297
Sir, we need to ask
you some questions.

2970
02:07:42,864 --> 02:07:44,906
Are you fucking kidding me?
Fuck you.

2971
02:07:44,907 --> 02:07:46,074
Come on, get up.

2972
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:47,768
Get the fuck out of my house.

2973
02:07:49,453 --> 02:07:51,246
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2974
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:52,831
I been sitting here all night.

2975
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:54,291
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2976
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:56,334
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2977
02:07:56,335 --> 02:07:57,502
Where you taking him?

2978
02:07:57,503 --> 02:07:58,587
You ain't got no warrant.

2979
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:00,228
Just come up in people's
house like that!

2980
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,425
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2981
02:08:03,426 --> 02:08:04,698
Huh?

2982
02:08:04,927 --> 02:08:06,119
Well?

2983
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:10,787
<i>Wow!</i>

2984
02:08:10,975 --> 02:08:12,873
<i>Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.</i>

2985
02:08:27,909 --> 02:08:30,387
Get out of the fucking way!

2986
02:08:32,246 --> 02:08:33,598
Fuck!

2987
02:08:39,128 --> 02:08:41,129
Did you drive

2988
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:42,857
that car tonight?

2989
02:08:43,883 --> 02:08:46,092
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2990
02:08:46,093 --> 02:08:47,969
I'm a family man!

2991
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:49,804
Family man. Honey!

2992
02:08:49,805 --> 02:08:51,806
<i>It was a miracle I wasn't killed,</i>

2993
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:54,935
<i>or that I didn't kill anybody else.</i>

2994
02:08:54,936 --> 02:08:56,686
<i>The cops took me in
for questioning,</i>

2995
02:08:56,687 --> 02:08:58,146
<i>but they couldn't charge me.</i>

2996
02:08:58,147 --> 02:09:00,690
<i>They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.</i>

2997
02:09:00,691 --> 02:09:01,816
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

2998
02:09:01,817 --> 02:09:03,985
<i>Brad did three months
in jail for contempt</i>

2999
02:09:03,986 --> 02:09:06,655
<i>because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.</i>

3000
02:09:06,656 --> 02:09:07,781
<i>The result,</i>

3001
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:09,491
<i>I was soot-free.</i>

3002
02:09:09,492 --> 02:09:11,952
<i>But I had eyes on me
like never before.</i>

3003
02:09:11,953 --> 02:09:13,662
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

3004
02:09:13,663 --> 02:09:16,665
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

3005
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,333
You know I don't believe
in luck, right?

3006
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:19,793
But it's time.

3007
02:09:19,794 --> 02:09:22,128
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

3008
02:09:22,129 --> 02:09:24,130
before your luck runs out.

3009
02:09:24,131 --> 02:09:25,799
Wave to Daddy.

3010
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:26,967
Hey.

3011
02:09:26,968 --> 02:09:28,570
Hey, sweetie.

3012
02:09:33,683 --> 02:09:37,018
What kind of terms would you
be talking about if I...

3013
02:09:37,019 --> 02:09:38,353
I don't know.

3014
02:09:38,354 --> 02:09:41,398
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

3015
02:09:41,399 --> 02:09:44,526
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

3016
02:09:44,527 --> 02:09:47,362
Ticky-tack shit like
that, you know.

3017
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:49,447
You pay a couple million
dollars in fines,

3018
02:09:49,448 --> 02:09:52,472
in exchange, the SEC fucks
off till the end of time.

3019
02:09:54,745 --> 02:09:56,472
And Stratton?

3020
02:09:56,872 --> 02:09:58,832
What happens to Stratton?

3021
02:09:58,833 --> 02:10:01,710
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

3022
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:02,961
Let Donnie be in charge.

3023
02:10:02,962 --> 02:10:04,655
Right. Donnie.

3024
02:10:05,298 --> 02:10:07,549
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

3025
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:09,384
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

3026
02:10:09,385 --> 02:10:12,220
However, with you stepping
down voluntarily,

3027
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:14,264
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

3028
02:10:14,265 --> 02:10:16,709
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

3029
02:10:17,727 --> 02:10:19,060
Jordan.

3030
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:21,104
What do you have to think about?

3031
02:10:21,105 --> 02:10:22,731
You beat them.

3032
02:10:22,732 --> 02:10:23,982
You won!

3033
02:10:23,983 --> 02:10:25,692
God knows you never
have to work again.

3034
02:10:25,693 --> 02:10:27,736
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

3035
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:28,903
- Is that what you want?
- No.

3036
02:10:28,904 --> 02:10:30,071
- Of course not.
- Okay.

3037
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:32,198
Okay! You got all the
money in the world.

3038
02:10:32,199 --> 02:10:33,867
You need everybody else's money?

3039
02:10:33,868 --> 02:10:35,368
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

3040
02:10:35,369 --> 02:10:37,746
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

3041
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:39,599
You built it, so now preserve it.

3042
02:11:10,738 --> 02:11:12,215
You know,

3043
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:15,325
five years ago, when I
started Stratton Oakmont

3044
02:11:15,326 --> 02:11:17,452
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

3045
02:11:17,453 --> 02:11:20,898
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

3046
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:24,376
And it's truly with a heavy heart

3047
02:11:24,377 --> 02:11:26,650
that I'm here to say that...

3048
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:30,507
That that day is finally here.

3049
02:11:34,553 --> 02:11:36,930
I wanna...
I want to thank you all for your...

3050
02:11:36,931 --> 02:11:39,682
Your years of loyalty
and admiration.

3051
02:11:39,683 --> 02:11:41,285
But the point is this.

3052
02:11:42,144 --> 02:11:43,478
Under Donnie's leadership,

3053
02:11:43,479 --> 02:11:47,023
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

3054
02:11:47,024 --> 02:11:49,943
moving into key management
positions, this place really

3055
02:11:49,944 --> 02:11:51,319
is gonna be better than ever!

3056
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:53,593
That I promise you. Okay?

3057
02:11:53,823 --> 02:11:56,426
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

3058
02:11:59,453 --> 02:12:02,247
This is Ellis Island here, people.

3059
02:12:02,248 --> 02:12:03,998
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

3060
02:12:03,999 --> 02:12:06,626
whether your relatives came
over on the fucking Mayflower

3061
02:12:06,627 --> 02:12:08,837
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

3062
02:12:08,838 --> 02:12:11,172
this right here is the
land of opportunity.

3063
02:12:11,173 --> 02:12:13,776
Stratton Oakmont is America!

3064
02:12:17,721 --> 02:12:19,472
All of you know
Kimmie Belzer, right?

3065
02:12:19,473 --> 02:12:20,723
Yes, we do.

3066
02:12:20,724 --> 02:12:21,933
Fuck you.

3067
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:23,852
Come on, Kimmie.

3068
02:12:23,853 --> 02:12:25,437
What you probably didn't know is,

3069
02:12:25,438 --> 02:12:27,355
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

3070
02:12:27,356 --> 02:12:29,709
one of Stratton's original 20.

3071
02:12:30,359 --> 02:12:32,318
Now most of you met Kimmie,

3072
02:12:32,319 --> 02:12:35,423
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

3073
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:38,927
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

3074
02:12:40,786 --> 02:12:43,480
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

3075
02:12:44,039 --> 02:12:45,957
A woman who spends

3076
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,500
her winters in the Bahamas

3077
02:12:47,501 --> 02:12:49,695
and summers in the Hamptons!

3078
02:12:54,592 --> 02:12:57,036
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

3079
02:12:59,763 --> 02:13:03,663
The Kimmie that I met didn't have
two nickels to rub together.

3080
02:13:04,768 --> 02:13:07,103
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

3081
02:13:07,104 --> 02:13:09,022
with an 8-year-old son.

3082
02:13:09,023 --> 02:13:12,127
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

3083
02:13:13,068 --> 02:13:16,863
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

3084
02:13:16,864 --> 02:13:19,115
she asked for a $5,000 advance

3085
02:13:19,116 --> 02:13:22,390
just so she could pay
her son's tuition.

3086
02:13:26,749 --> 02:13:28,583
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

3087
02:13:28,584 --> 02:13:30,357
Go on, tell them.

3088
02:13:32,046 --> 02:13:34,194
You wrote me a check

3089
02:13:34,298 --> 02:13:36,526
for $25,000.

3090
02:13:37,718 --> 02:13:39,240
That's right.

3091
02:13:39,261 --> 02:13:40,704
Thank you.

3092
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:45,868
And you know why that is?

3093
02:13:49,104 --> 02:13:51,548
It's because I believed in you.

3094
02:13:53,108 --> 02:13:55,927
It's because I believed
in you, Kimmie,

3095
02:13:56,278 --> 02:13:58,112
just like I believe in each

3096
02:13:58,113 --> 02:14:00,240
and every one of you here today.

3097
02:14:00,241 --> 02:14:02,700
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

3098
02:14:02,701 --> 02:14:04,619
I fucking love you! I love you.

3099
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:07,519
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

3100
02:14:10,292 --> 02:14:12,394
And I love all of you!

3101
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:15,296
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

3102
02:14:15,297 --> 02:14:17,900
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

3103
02:14:18,634 --> 02:14:20,987
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

3104
02:14:27,393 --> 02:14:29,666
It's a shame, you know.

3105
02:14:31,146 --> 02:14:33,231
For years, I've been
telling you guys

3106
02:14:33,232 --> 02:14:35,358
never to take no for
an answer, right?

3107
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:38,679
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

3108
02:14:39,488 --> 02:14:41,841
until you get what you want.

3109
02:14:42,658 --> 02:14:44,476
Because you all deserve it.

3110
02:14:46,412 --> 02:14:49,732
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

3111
02:14:50,124 --> 02:14:52,333
barring me from the
securities industry,

3112
02:14:52,334 --> 02:14:54,436
barring me from Stratton,

3113
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:56,943
my home.

3114
02:14:59,633 --> 02:15:01,735
What the fuck is that, you know?

3115
02:15:02,845 --> 02:15:05,289
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

3116
02:15:05,889 --> 02:15:08,788
It's me taking no for an answer,
you know.

3117
02:15:10,185 --> 02:15:11,519
It's them...

3118
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:14,874
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

3119
02:15:15,524 --> 02:15:18,343
It's me being a hypocrite
is what it is.

3120
02:15:23,407 --> 02:15:24,804
So...

3121
02:15:31,790 --> 02:15:33,483
You know what?

3122
02:15:37,171 --> 02:15:38,838
I'm not leaving.

3123
02:15:41,091 --> 02:15:42,488
I'm not leaving.

3124
02:15:45,304 --> 02:15:46,554
I'm not fucking leaving!

3125
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:54,038
You're not getting
a fucking promotion!

3126
02:15:55,314 --> 02:15:56,791
The show goes on!

3127
02:15:59,276 --> 02:16:00,777
This is my home!

3128
02:16:00,778 --> 02:16:03,613
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

3129
02:16:03,614 --> 02:16:05,637
to take me out of here!

3130
02:16:07,534 --> 02:16:10,078
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

3131
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:11,913
or fucking SWAT team

3132
02:16:11,914 --> 02:16:14,517
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

3133
02:16:17,252 --> 02:16:18,353
Fuck them!

3134
02:16:20,756 --> 02:16:22,654
Fuck them!

3135
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:58,543
Jordy! Jordy!

3136
02:16:58,544 --> 02:17:00,646
Jordy! Get back here!

3137
02:17:01,422 --> 02:17:02,648
Hey!

3138
02:17:05,008 --> 02:17:06,342
Give me that.

3139
02:17:08,804 --> 02:17:09,971
What is this?

3140
02:17:09,972 --> 02:17:12,575
<i>Ramar of the Jungle,
for Christ sake?</i>

3141
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:16,602
<i>Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.</i>

3142
02:17:16,603 --> 02:17:20,148
<i>Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.</i>

3143
02:17:20,149 --> 02:17:22,923
<i>He is back in the ocean.
Happy hunting.</i>

3144
02:17:35,706 --> 02:17:38,082
<i>It was our time to party big.</i>

3145
02:17:38,083 --> 02:17:40,811
<i>And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.</i>

3146
02:17:41,545 --> 02:17:43,921
<i>I apologized, even
offered to pay him</i>

3147
02:17:43,922 --> 02:17:45,615
<i>for his time in the can.</i>

3148
02:17:46,133 --> 02:17:48,301
<i>But he said no, that he was out.</i>

3149
02:17:48,302 --> 02:17:50,219
<i>He didn't want any part of us.</i>

3150
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:51,929
<i>Sad thing was,</i>

3151
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:53,514
<i>two years later</i>

3152
02:17:53,515 --> 02:17:55,288
<i>he was dead.</i>

3153
02:17:55,350 --> 02:17:57,828
<i>Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.</i>

3154
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,980
<i>Same age Mozart died.</i>

3155
02:18:00,981 --> 02:18:04,317
<i>Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...</i>

3156
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:06,716
<i>Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.</i>

3157
02:18:08,781 --> 02:18:10,031
<i>Within days,</i>

3158
02:18:10,032 --> 02:18:12,492
<i>subpoenas started flying.</i>

3159
02:18:12,493 --> 02:18:15,870
<i>Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.</i>

3160
02:18:15,871 --> 02:18:17,997
<i>Donnie couldn't drink
water fast enough.</i>

3161
02:18:17,998 --> 02:18:20,541
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

3162
02:18:20,542 --> 02:18:23,942
Here's what we do with
subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

3163
02:18:29,551 --> 02:18:32,261
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

3164
02:18:32,262 --> 02:18:34,222
Fuck you! Fuck you!

3165
02:18:34,223 --> 02:18:36,826
Fuck you!

3166
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:43,332
Oh!

3167
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:45,817
Jordan Belfort.

3168
02:18:45,818 --> 02:18:47,902
Alden. That's a nice name.

3169
02:18:47,903 --> 02:18:49,237
Thank you very much for that.

3170
02:18:49,238 --> 02:18:51,531
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

3171
02:18:51,532 --> 02:18:53,241
I do not recall that.

3172
02:18:53,242 --> 02:18:55,701
I do not recall that. Okay?

3173
02:18:55,702 --> 02:18:57,912
Mr. Ming,
thank you for coming in today.

3174
02:18:57,913 --> 02:18:59,622
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

3175
02:18:59,623 --> 02:19:00,915
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

3176
02:19:00,916 --> 02:19:02,708
<i>They interrogated everybody.</i>

3177
02:19:02,709 --> 02:19:04,418
I got a low blood sugar,
thyroid thing.

3178
02:19:04,419 --> 02:19:05,628
<i>It went on for months.</i>

3179
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:07,755
<i>It was a total fucking harassment.</i>

3180
02:19:07,756 --> 02:19:09,423
Tell him to proceed
with the questions.

3181
02:19:09,424 --> 02:19:11,926
<i>But not a single
Strattonite cracked.</i>

3182
02:19:11,927 --> 02:19:13,678
Gladys Carrera?

3183
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:15,304
Doesn't ring a bell.

3184
02:19:15,305 --> 02:19:18,033
Sorry, I have no
recommendation of that.

3185
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:19,183
No.

3186
02:19:19,184 --> 02:19:20,268
No idea.

3187
02:19:20,269 --> 02:19:22,854
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

3188
02:19:22,855 --> 02:19:25,231
Absolutely not.

3189
02:19:25,232 --> 02:19:27,108
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

3190
02:19:27,109 --> 02:19:29,443
I just thought you
might remember that.

3191
02:19:29,444 --> 02:19:30,987
<i>Would you remember any of those?</i>

3192
02:19:30,988 --> 02:19:32,822
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3193
02:19:32,823 --> 02:19:35,116
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3194
02:19:35,117 --> 02:19:36,826
It was a long phone call.

3195
02:19:36,827 --> 02:19:38,619
I just wondered
if you have any memory of that.

3196
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:40,454
Okay. You know we've
talked to several

3197
02:19:40,455 --> 02:19:41,831
of the employees at this firm

3198
02:19:41,832 --> 02:19:43,124
and nobody can recall anything

3199
02:19:43,125 --> 02:19:45,251
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3200
02:19:45,252 --> 02:19:46,569
I think it's Odd.

3201
02:19:48,338 --> 02:19:49,630
Do you recall

3202
02:19:49,631 --> 02:19:50,923
Cartage Corporation?

3203
02:19:50,924 --> 02:19:52,341
Mmm.

3204
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:53,676
You do recall it?

3205
02:19:53,677 --> 02:19:55,074
No, I don't recall that at all.

3206
02:19:55,554 --> 02:19:58,578
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3207
02:19:59,141 --> 02:20:01,309
Are you gonna say
anything about that?

3208
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:02,685
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3209
02:20:02,686 --> 02:20:04,478
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3210
02:20:04,479 --> 02:20:06,272
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3211
02:20:06,273 --> 02:20:08,216
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3212
02:20:10,152 --> 02:20:11,986
Can I get you anything
else, gentlemen?

3213
02:20:11,987 --> 02:20:13,905
Yes. Sweetheart,
I have a rare condition

3214
02:20:13,906 --> 02:20:15,323
which requires me to
drink one of those

3215
02:20:15,324 --> 02:20:17,426
every 15 minutes, please.

3216
02:20:17,826 --> 02:20:20,995
<i>We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.</i>

3217
02:20:20,996 --> 02:20:23,144
<i>So, we took our wives to Italy.</i>

3218
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:25,917
<i>We figured we were safer
working from overseas</i>

3219
02:20:25,918 --> 02:20:27,376
<i>giving orders to Rugrat.</i>

3220
02:20:27,377 --> 02:20:29,670
<i>Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove</i>

3221
02:20:29,671 --> 02:20:31,714
<i>I was still running
Stratton from a yacht.</i>

3222
02:20:31,715 --> 02:20:33,049
Hey, Rugrat.

3223
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:34,342
- Oh!
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

3224
02:20:34,343 --> 02:20:36,385
You bald-headed eagle,
how you doing?

3225
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:37,470
<i>Donnie, Donnie, listen!</i>

3226
02:20:37,471 --> 02:20:38,846
We have a problem, okay.

3227
02:20:38,847 --> 02:20:42,183
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3228
02:20:42,184 --> 02:20:44,310
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3229
02:20:44,311 --> 02:20:45,937
<i>- What's going on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!</i>

3230
02:20:45,938 --> 02:20:48,522
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3231
02:20:48,523 --> 02:20:49,844
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3232
02:20:50,192 --> 02:20:52,044
Give me that goddamn phone.

3233
02:20:52,110 --> 02:20:53,803
What's going on?

3234
02:20:53,862 --> 02:20:56,030
Jordan, look.
I'm watching the screen

3235
02:20:56,031 --> 02:20:58,866
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3236
02:20:58,867 --> 02:21:00,952
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3237
02:21:00,953 --> 02:21:03,079
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3238
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:04,163
It's Donnie.
Call me back, all right.

3239
02:21:04,164 --> 02:21:05,247
Donnie, your little friend

3240
02:21:05,248 --> 02:21:06,582
is trying to fuck
me, you know that.

3241
02:21:06,583 --> 02:21:08,376
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3242
02:21:08,377 --> 02:21:10,044
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3243
02:21:10,045 --> 02:21:11,522
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3244
02:21:11,922 --> 02:21:13,714
<i>Even though I owned 85%</i>

3245
02:21:13,715 --> 02:21:16,884
<i>of Steve-cocksucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,</i>

3246
02:21:16,885 --> 02:21:19,220
<i>the shares were in
his fucking name.</i>

3247
02:21:19,221 --> 02:21:21,514
<i>This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds</i>

3248
02:21:21,515 --> 02:21:23,391
<i>and was trying to take advantage.</i>

3249
02:21:23,392 --> 02:21:24,934
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3250
02:21:24,935 --> 02:21:26,769
I want you to get all our clients
on the phone right now

3251
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:28,187
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3252
02:21:28,188 --> 02:21:29,730
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3253
02:21:29,731 --> 02:21:31,565
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3254
02:21:31,566 --> 02:21:33,109
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

3255
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:35,277
<i>If that little fucking prick thinks
he can fuck with me,</i>

3256
02:21:35,278 --> 02:21:37,947
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

3257
02:21:37,948 --> 02:21:39,448
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

3258
02:21:39,449 --> 02:21:40,992
<i>Let's just not
jump to conclusions</i>

3259
02:21:40,993 --> 02:21:42,451
<i>before we know what's going on.</i>

3260
02:21:42,452 --> 02:21:43,911
Captain Ted!

3261
02:21:43,912 --> 02:21:45,104
Captain Ted!

3262
02:21:45,497 --> 02:21:47,957
Hang up your phones!
Everybody, hey!

3263
02:21:47,958 --> 02:21:50,857
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

3264
02:21:53,839 --> 02:21:56,362
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3265
02:21:56,508 --> 02:21:57,860
I just...

3266
02:21:58,176 --> 02:21:59,528
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3267
02:22:00,595 --> 02:22:02,288
Aunt Emma...

3268
02:22:03,098 --> 02:22:04,495
Just wait.

3269
02:22:04,766 --> 02:22:06,475
I can't...

3270
02:22:06,476 --> 02:22:09,437
What's going on? Why you crying?

3271
02:22:09,438 --> 02:22:11,605
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3272
02:22:11,606 --> 02:22:14,066
I just got a call
from my cousin Betty.

3273
02:22:14,067 --> 02:22:15,234
Yeah?

3274
02:22:15,235 --> 02:22:17,053
Aunt Emma is dead.

3275
02:22:18,321 --> 02:22:21,140
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3276
02:22:21,408 --> 02:22:22,634
You're serious?

3277
02:22:23,326 --> 02:22:25,745
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3278
02:22:25,746 --> 02:22:27,288
Oh, fuck!

3279
02:22:27,289 --> 02:22:29,123
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3280
02:22:29,124 --> 02:22:30,541
<i>Fucking heart attack!</i>

3281
02:22:30,542 --> 02:22:32,209
<i>Boom, snap, gone.</i>

3282
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:34,128
<i>Shuffled off her mortal coil.</i>

3283
02:22:34,129 --> 02:22:37,590
<i>And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.</i>

3284
02:22:37,591 --> 02:22:39,759
The last time I talked to her
she was fine!

3285
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,969
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3286
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:44,221
That's so fucking terrible!

3287
02:22:44,222 --> 02:22:46,015
Oh, fuck!

3288
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:47,141
It is terrible.

3289
02:22:47,142 --> 02:22:49,727
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3290
02:22:49,728 --> 02:22:51,562
My condolences to you
and your family.

3291
02:22:51,563 --> 02:22:53,147
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3292
02:22:53,148 --> 02:22:55,274
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

3293
02:22:55,275 --> 02:22:56,567
Now where does that leave us

3294
02:22:56,568 --> 02:22:58,235
in regard to her account exactly?

3295
02:22:58,236 --> 02:22:59,820
Does it go into probate or what?

3296
02:22:59,821 --> 02:23:01,489
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3297
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:03,282
Your aunt, before she died,

3298
02:23:03,283 --> 02:23:06,262
signed a document naming you
as her successor.

3299
02:23:06,453 --> 02:23:07,995
She did?

3300
02:23:07,996 --> 02:23:09,769
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3301
02:23:09,956 --> 02:23:12,229
Well, not as of yet.

3302
02:23:12,417 --> 02:23:14,502
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3303
02:23:16,838 --> 02:23:18,672
I can't seem to hear you.

3304
02:23:18,673 --> 02:23:21,447
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3305
02:23:21,510 --> 02:23:24,303
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
<i>- Fast?</i>

3306
02:23:24,304 --> 02:23:26,472
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3307
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:30,267
Speak English!
Fucking speak English!

3308
02:23:30,268 --> 02:23:31,685
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Quiet, okay?

3309
02:23:31,686 --> 02:23:33,187
Take your suit,
take your dick, okay,

3310
02:23:33,188 --> 02:23:34,980
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

3311
02:23:34,981 --> 02:23:37,066
Move my ass! Yes!

3312
02:23:37,067 --> 02:23:41,278
<i>I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.</i>

3313
02:23:41,279 --> 02:23:43,322
<i>Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger</i>

3314
02:23:43,323 --> 02:23:45,366
<i>who could fake Aunt
Emma's signature.</i>

3315
02:23:45,367 --> 02:23:47,014
You American shit!

3316
02:23:47,077 --> 02:23:48,911
<i>I just had to get
there by tomorrow,</i>

3317
02:23:48,912 --> 02:23:50,538
<i>or lose $20 million.</i>

3318
02:23:50,539 --> 02:23:52,357
We're going to Monaco!

3319
02:23:52,833 --> 02:23:55,209
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3320
02:23:55,210 --> 02:23:57,878
We're going to Monaco, so then
we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3321
02:23:57,879 --> 02:23:59,652
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3322
02:23:59,673 --> 02:24:00,923
But I have business in Switzerland.

3323
02:24:00,924 --> 02:24:02,633
I need to go to
Switzerland right now.

3324
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:04,828
Bottom line. Sorry.

3325
02:24:05,053 --> 02:24:06,905
We gotta get to London.

3326
02:24:07,347 --> 02:24:08,664
Why? Why?

3327
02:24:10,058 --> 02:24:11,350
The funeral!

3328
02:24:11,351 --> 02:24:12,794
Yeah, but babe. Look, look...

3329
02:24:13,145 --> 02:24:15,980
I loved your aunt more than
anyone in the entire world.

3330
02:24:15,981 --> 02:24:17,628
I really did.

3331
02:24:18,024 --> 02:24:20,317
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3332
02:24:20,318 --> 02:24:22,611
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3333
02:24:22,612 --> 02:24:23,904
She'll still be dead by the time

3334
02:24:23,905 --> 02:24:25,131
we get to London, okay?

3335
02:24:25,657 --> 02:24:27,491
Captain Ted! Captain
Ted, all right, look.

3336
02:24:27,492 --> 02:24:29,410
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3337
02:24:29,411 --> 02:24:30,494
Monaco, right.

3338
02:24:30,495 --> 02:24:32,454
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3339
02:24:32,455 --> 02:24:33,873
so they don't stamp our passports.

3340
02:24:33,874 --> 02:24:35,791
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3341
02:24:35,792 --> 02:24:37,585
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3342
02:24:37,586 --> 02:24:39,128
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3343
02:24:39,129 --> 02:24:40,421
That's the fucking plan.

3344
02:24:40,422 --> 02:24:42,882
I just want you to know
that we might run into some chop.

3345
02:24:42,883 --> 02:24:45,134
Chop?
We can fucking handle chop, right?

3346
02:24:45,135 --> 02:24:46,635
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3347
02:24:46,636 --> 02:24:48,053
No, no, no. We're
not going anywhere

3348
02:24:48,054 --> 02:24:49,430
unless he says it's
safe, all right.

3349
02:24:49,431 --> 02:24:50,973
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3350
02:24:50,974 --> 02:24:52,433
You don't know shit about chop.

3351
02:24:52,434 --> 02:24:54,685
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3352
02:24:54,686 --> 02:24:57,104
I'll chop your fucking credit
card in half. How about that?

3353
02:24:57,105 --> 02:24:59,106
Chop is fine. Trust me.
Chop is fine.

3354
02:24:59,107 --> 02:25:00,858
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3355
02:25:00,859 --> 02:25:02,109
Uh...

3356
02:25:02,110 --> 02:25:04,069
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3357
02:25:04,070 --> 02:25:05,279
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3358
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,947
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3359
02:25:06,948 --> 02:25:08,240
It's gonna be safe.

3360
02:25:08,241 --> 02:25:10,451
We'll batten down the hatches

3361
02:25:10,452 --> 02:25:11,911
and secure the deck.

3362
02:25:11,912 --> 02:25:15,456
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3363
02:25:15,457 --> 02:25:16,916
Few broken dishes.

3364
02:25:16,917 --> 02:25:18,167
What's a few broken dishes?

3365
02:25:18,168 --> 02:25:19,543
Does that sound fucking
awesome or what?

3366
02:25:19,544 --> 02:25:21,003
No. Not really.

3367
02:25:21,004 --> 02:25:22,379
We're gonna have a
fucking good time!

3368
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:24,215
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3369
02:25:24,216 --> 02:25:25,408
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3370
02:25:30,805 --> 02:25:31,952
Hold On!

3371
02:25:35,018 --> 02:25:38,145
What the fuck is going on out here?

3372
02:25:38,146 --> 02:25:40,814
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3373
02:25:40,815 --> 02:25:42,942
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3374
02:25:42,943 --> 02:25:45,152
<i>Gale warning! Gale warning!</i>

3375
02:25:45,153 --> 02:25:47,988
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3376
02:25:47,989 --> 02:25:49,782
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3377
02:25:49,783 --> 02:25:51,033
- We can't!
- Go!

3378
02:25:51,034 --> 02:25:53,702
We'll get broad-sided.
It'll tip over!

3379
02:25:53,703 --> 02:25:55,621
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3380
02:25:55,622 --> 02:25:56,705
I'm a master diver!

3381
02:25:56,706 --> 02:25:58,040
No one's gonna fucking die!

3382
02:25:58,041 --> 02:26:00,751
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3383
02:26:00,752 --> 02:26:02,127
I love you.

3384
02:26:02,128 --> 02:26:04,129
I love you, baby.
Just hold on tight.

3385
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:05,214
Okay.

3386
02:26:05,215 --> 02:26:06,362
Donnie!

3387
02:26:07,842 --> 02:26:09,176
Hold on, baby!

3388
02:26:09,177 --> 02:26:10,278
Donnie!

3389
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:13,327
Donnie!

3390
02:26:13,723 --> 02:26:15,182
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3391
02:26:15,183 --> 02:26:16,809
Get the fucking ludes.

3392
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:18,018
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3393
02:26:18,019 --> 02:26:20,838
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3394
02:26:20,855 --> 02:26:23,816
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3395
02:26:23,817 --> 02:26:25,885
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3396
02:26:26,027 --> 02:26:27,299
What are you saying?

3397
02:26:27,696 --> 02:26:29,264
Fuck!

3398
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:31,282
Get the ludes!

3399
02:26:31,283 --> 02:26:32,992
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3400
02:26:32,993 --> 02:26:34,326
It's three feet of
water down there!

3401
02:26:34,327 --> 02:26:37,162
I will not die sober!

3402
02:26:37,163 --> 02:26:38,998
Get those fucking ludes!

3403
02:26:38,999 --> 02:26:40,082
Okay!

3404
02:26:40,083 --> 02:26:41,526
- Go!
- Okay

3405
02:26:44,296 --> 02:26:46,130
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3406
02:26:46,131 --> 02:26:47,840
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3407
02:26:47,841 --> 02:26:49,281
He's just warning everybody!

3408
02:27:01,146 --> 02:27:02,998
Jesus Christ!

3409
02:27:04,441 --> 02:27:05,733
Hold on!

3410
02:27:05,734 --> 02:27:07,234
Get away from the window!

3411
02:27:07,235 --> 02:27:08,736
Rogue wave!

3412
02:27:08,737 --> 02:27:09,862
Mayday!

3413
02:27:09,863 --> 02:27:12,531
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht Naomi!

3414
02:27:12,532 --> 02:27:14,134
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3415
02:27:14,451 --> 02:27:15,803
I got 'em!

3416
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:18,454
Give me one for the nerves!

3417
02:27:18,455 --> 02:27:19,705
We're going down!

3418
02:27:19,706 --> 02:27:21,957
This is a fucking Mayday!

3419
02:27:21,958 --> 02:27:24,186
We require immediate assistance!

3420
02:27:25,754 --> 02:27:27,379
Hold on!

3421
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:28,481
Watch out!

3422
02:27:40,268 --> 02:27:42,917
<i>The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians</i>

3423
02:27:43,104 --> 02:27:46,774
<i>is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,</i>

3424
02:27:46,775 --> 02:27:48,843
<i>then you get to dance.</i>

3425
02:28:05,293 --> 02:28:07,066
<i>Did you see that?</i>

3426
02:28:07,379 --> 02:28:10,403
<i>That was the plane
I sent to come get us.</i>

3427
02:28:11,216 --> 02:28:12,883
<i>I shit you not, it exploded</i>

3428
02:28:12,884 --> 02:28:15,052
<i>when a seagull flew
into the engine.</i>

3429
02:28:15,053 --> 02:28:17,155
<i>Three people killed.</i>

3430
02:28:21,267 --> 02:28:23,143
<i>You want a sign from God?</i>

3431
02:28:23,144 --> 02:28:26,373
<i>Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.</i>

3432
02:28:31,694 --> 02:28:35,447
<i>Do you dream of becoming
financially independent</i>

3433
02:28:35,448 --> 02:28:38,158
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3434
02:28:38,159 --> 02:28:40,119
Would you like to own
a home like this,

3435
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:42,329
but can barely afford
to pay your rent?

3436
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:44,039
My name is Jordan Belfort,

3437
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:46,166
and there's no secret
to wealth creation.

3438
02:28:46,167 --> 02:28:47,501
No matter who you are,

3439
02:28:47,502 --> 02:28:48,836
no matter where you came from,

3440
02:28:48,837 --> 02:28:51,380
you too can become
financially independent

3441
02:28:51,381 --> 02:28:53,215
in just a matter of months.

3442
02:28:53,216 --> 02:28:55,467
All you need is a strategy.

3443
02:28:55,468 --> 02:28:57,177
When I was 24 years old,

3444
02:28:57,178 --> 02:29:01,056
I made a decision not just
to survive, but to thrive.

3445
02:29:01,057 --> 02:29:03,600
<i>At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.</i>

3446
02:29:03,601 --> 02:29:07,146
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3447
02:29:07,147 --> 02:29:08,355
I certainly believe now.

3448
02:29:08,356 --> 02:29:09,857
Think about it for a second.

3449
02:29:09,858 --> 02:29:12,025
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

3450
02:29:12,026 --> 02:29:14,278
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3451
02:29:14,279 --> 02:29:15,946
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3452
02:29:15,947 --> 02:29:17,698
<i>If you want to be
a millionaire someday,</i>

3453
02:29:17,699 --> 02:29:19,783
<i>have some guts. Make a decision.</i>

3454
02:29:19,784 --> 02:29:21,118
Jordan Belfort's
setup worked for me

3455
02:29:21,119 --> 02:29:22,619
because I worked hard for it.

3456
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:24,163
And if it doesn't work for you,

3457
02:29:24,164 --> 02:29:25,247
it's because you're lazy.

3458
02:29:25,248 --> 02:29:26,540
And you should get a
job at McDonald's.

3459
02:29:26,541 --> 02:29:29,501
<i>There's nobody holding
you back from financial freedom.</i>

3460
02:29:29,502 --> 02:29:32,463
And there's nobody stopping
you from making millions.

3461
02:29:32,464 --> 02:29:33,797
Don't just sit at home,

3462
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:36,526
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3463
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:41,180
I changed all these people's lives

3464
02:29:41,181 --> 02:29:42,890
and I can change yours, too!

3465
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:44,224
So come to my seminar!

3466
02:29:44,225 --> 02:29:45,726
The life of your dreams is only...

3467
02:29:45,727 --> 02:29:47,519
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3468
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:48,645
You're under arrest!

3469
02:29:48,646 --> 02:29:50,339
You gotta be joking!

3470
02:29:51,524 --> 02:29:52,816
You're kidding me.

3471
02:29:52,817 --> 02:29:54,485
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3472
02:29:54,486 --> 02:29:55,819
Turn that camera off.

3473
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:57,905
I'm fucking shooting a
fucking infomercial here,

3474
02:29:57,906 --> 02:29:59,406
you fucking cocksucker!

3475
02:29:59,407 --> 02:30:01,158
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3476
02:30:01,159 --> 02:30:03,035
You don't got shit
on me, you hear me!

3477
02:30:03,036 --> 02:30:04,161
Go fuck yourself!

3478
02:30:04,162 --> 02:30:06,622
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3479
02:30:06,623 --> 02:30:07,748
Hey, Jordan,

3480
02:30:07,749 --> 02:30:09,708
let me give you a
little legal advice.

3481
02:30:09,709 --> 02:30:11,210
Shut the fuck up!

3482
02:30:11,211 --> 02:30:12,794
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3483
02:30:12,795 --> 02:30:15,489
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3484
02:30:17,175 --> 02:30:18,717
<i>I clean up my act.</i>

3485
02:30:18,718 --> 02:30:21,345
<i>I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.</i>

3486
02:30:21,346 --> 02:30:24,181
<i>I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!</i>

3487
02:30:24,182 --> 02:30:26,475
<i>Rugrat goes and gets busted
down in Miami.</i>

3488
02:30:26,476 --> 02:30:27,809
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3489
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:29,603
<i>And guess who
the fuck with? Saurel.</i>

3490
02:30:29,604 --> 02:30:30,729
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3491
02:30:30,730 --> 02:30:33,065
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3492
02:30:33,066 --> 02:30:34,858
<i>I mean, what are
the fucking odds?</i>

3493
02:30:34,859 --> 02:30:37,611
<i>There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,</i>

3494
02:30:37,612 --> 02:30:39,279
<i>and Rugrat gets the
one dumb enough</i>

3495
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:41,448
<i>to get himself arrested
on U. S. soil.</i>

3496
02:30:41,449 --> 02:30:42,926
I know.

3497
02:30:42,951 --> 02:30:44,428
I'm so sorry.

3498
02:30:46,538 --> 02:30:47,829
<i>Even more fucked</i>

3499
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:49,289
<i>- was that he got busted</i>

3500
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:51,041
<i>for shit that had
nothing to do with me.</i>

3501
02:30:51,042 --> 02:30:52,709
<i>It had nothing to
fucking do with me.</i>

3502
02:30:52,710 --> 02:30:54,795
<i>Something about
laundering drug money</i>

3503
02:30:54,796 --> 02:30:57,965
<i>through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,</i>

3504
02:30:57,966 --> 02:31:00,133
<i>you know, the founder of Benihana.</i>

3505
02:31:00,134 --> 02:31:01,593
<i>Benihana.</i>

3506
02:31:01,594 --> 02:31:03,367
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3507
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:05,514
<i>Beni-fucking-hana!</i>

3508
02:31:05,515 --> 02:31:06,598
<i>Why?</i>

3509
02:31:06,599 --> 02:31:08,016
<i>Why, why, God?</i>

3510
02:31:08,017 --> 02:31:09,601
<i>Why would you be so cruel</i>

3511
02:31:09,602 --> 02:31:12,229
<i>as to choose a chain
of fucking hibachi restaurants</i>

3512
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:13,582
<i>to take me down?</i>

3513
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:18,485
<i>Long story short.
Saurel rats me out.</i>

3514
02:31:18,486 --> 02:31:21,655
<i>But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,</i>

3515
02:31:21,656 --> 02:31:23,323
<i>who, it turns out,
he'd been fucking</i>

3516
02:31:23,324 --> 02:31:25,893
<i>every time she went to Switzerland!</i>

3517
02:31:27,745 --> 02:31:30,394
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

3518
02:31:32,500 --> 02:31:34,334
- All right!
- Ah!

3519
02:31:34,335 --> 02:31:36,169
<i>One count engaging in conspiracy</i>

3520
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:37,921
<i>to commit securities fraud.</i>

3521
02:31:37,922 --> 02:31:40,215
<i>Two counts securities fraud.</i>

3522
02:31:40,216 --> 02:31:43,760
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3523
02:31:43,761 --> 02:31:46,096
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3524
02:31:46,097 --> 02:31:48,620
One count obstruction of justice.

3525
02:31:49,517 --> 02:31:51,836
Bail is set at $10 million.

3526
02:32:06,993 --> 02:32:08,561
<i>Uncle Donnie's here!</i>

3527
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:11,689
Rocky. How you doing?

3528
02:32:12,290 --> 02:32:14,666
Woof. I hate that fucking dog.

3529
02:32:14,667 --> 02:32:17,044
Yeah, he's getting
old and decrepit.

3530
02:32:17,045 --> 02:32:18,629
Starting to shit in
the house again.

3531
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:20,422
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3532
02:32:20,423 --> 02:32:21,798
Ah, fuck.

3533
02:32:21,799 --> 02:32:23,550
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3534
02:32:23,551 --> 02:32:24,801
Good to see you.

3535
02:32:24,802 --> 02:32:27,451
Sit down. Oh, man.

3536
02:32:29,223 --> 02:32:30,575
How you doing, brother?

3537
02:32:31,309 --> 02:32:32,893
You know.

3538
02:32:32,894 --> 02:32:34,645
Shitty, pal.

3539
02:32:34,646 --> 02:32:36,874
But I'm hanging in there.

3540
02:32:38,107 --> 02:32:40,734
My new piece of jewelry.
Check that out.

3541
02:32:40,735 --> 02:32:43,195
Can't leave the house, you know?

3542
02:32:43,196 --> 02:32:45,845
Starting to get cabin
fever already.

3543
02:32:46,324 --> 02:32:48,017
Fucking Rugrat.

3544
02:32:48,451 --> 02:32:49,868
That wig-wearing faggot.

3545
02:32:49,869 --> 02:32:52,079
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3546
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:54,748
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3547
02:32:54,749 --> 02:32:57,084
Irresponsible little prick.

3548
02:32:58,211 --> 02:32:59,358
I'll tell you one thing.

3549
02:33:00,588 --> 02:33:03,191
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3550
02:33:03,925 --> 02:33:06,198
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3551
02:33:07,512 --> 02:33:09,205
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3552
02:33:09,889 --> 02:33:11,264
That's her in the house there.

3553
02:33:11,265 --> 02:33:13,333
You could say hi, but she
probably won't wave back.

3554
02:33:13,434 --> 02:33:15,207
Naomi, sweetheart!

3555
02:33:18,564 --> 02:33:19,898
What's up her ass?

3556
02:33:19,899 --> 02:33:21,483
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3557
02:33:21,484 --> 02:33:23,068
We probably have to
mortgage the house

3558
02:33:23,069 --> 02:33:24,945
in order to make bail.

3559
02:33:24,946 --> 02:33:26,446
Probably end up selling the thing

3560
02:33:26,447 --> 02:33:28,699
in order to pay for
all the lawyers.

3561
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:31,269
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3562
02:33:31,452 --> 02:33:33,225
What are you gonna do, right?

3563
02:33:33,955 --> 02:33:36,832
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3564
02:33:36,833 --> 02:33:37,999
How's morale?

3565
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,752
They all pissed off 'cause they
have to make money legally now?

3566
02:33:40,753 --> 02:33:42,275
- Jordan.
- Hmm?

3567
02:33:42,547 --> 02:33:45,090
I got the founding
partners together.

3568
02:33:45,091 --> 02:33:47,569
I talked to them about everything.

3569
02:33:48,219 --> 02:33:49,366
And I got you.

3570
02:33:50,096 --> 02:33:51,743
What do you mean, you got me?

3571
02:33:52,807 --> 02:33:55,626
The house, money, don't
worry about it. I got you.

3572
02:34:01,524 --> 02:34:02,691
All right.

3573
02:34:02,692 --> 02:34:03,775
I love you, buddy.

3574
02:34:03,776 --> 02:34:05,777
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3575
02:34:05,778 --> 02:34:07,846
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3576
02:34:08,698 --> 02:34:09,948
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3577
02:34:09,949 --> 02:34:11,158
All right, enough, enough.

3578
02:34:13,161 --> 02:34:14,411
You want a beer, pal?

3579
02:34:14,412 --> 02:34:15,704
What are you drinking?

3580
02:34:15,705 --> 02:34:17,873
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3581
02:34:17,874 --> 02:34:19,166
What's that?

3582
02:34:19,167 --> 02:34:22,294
A non-alcoholic beer.
It's got no alcohol.

3583
02:34:22,295 --> 02:34:24,648
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3584
02:34:25,131 --> 02:34:26,465
But if you drink enough,

3585
02:34:26,466 --> 02:34:28,467
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3586
02:34:28,468 --> 02:34:30,635
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3587
02:34:30,636 --> 02:34:31,762
I'm not a scientist.

3588
02:34:31,763 --> 02:34:33,013
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3589
02:34:33,014 --> 02:34:34,681
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3590
02:34:34,682 --> 02:34:36,933
I know, but I don't drink.
You remember?

3591
02:34:36,934 --> 02:34:38,185
I don't drink anymore.

3592
02:34:38,186 --> 02:34:39,269
Oh, you wanna go inside

3593
02:34:39,270 --> 02:34:40,771
and blow some lines
of baking powder?

3594
02:34:40,772 --> 02:34:42,689
Or baking soda...

3595
02:34:42,690 --> 02:34:45,066
Can't imagine ever not
enjoying getting fucked up.

3596
02:34:45,067 --> 02:34:46,610
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3597
02:34:46,611 --> 02:34:48,195
How's being sober?

3598
02:34:48,196 --> 02:34:50,155
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3599
02:34:50,156 --> 02:34:52,634
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3600
02:34:53,075 --> 02:34:55,702
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3601
02:34:55,703 --> 02:34:57,245
unless circumstances dictate,

3602
02:34:57,246 --> 02:34:59,331
and I think they do
dictate in this case,

3603
02:34:59,332 --> 02:35:00,832
and the term is "Grenada."

3604
02:35:00,833 --> 02:35:02,417
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3605
02:35:02,418 --> 02:35:03,585
No. No, I haven't.

3606
02:35:03,586 --> 02:35:05,212
Grenada's very interesting because

3607
02:35:05,213 --> 02:35:07,214
it is a small island nation

3608
02:35:07,215 --> 02:35:10,842
that was invaded by the United
States of America in 1983.

3609
02:35:10,843 --> 02:35:13,011
It's about 90,000 people.

3610
02:35:13,012 --> 02:35:15,331
And essentially, it means

3611
02:35:16,015 --> 02:35:18,058
this case is unloseable.

3612
02:35:18,059 --> 02:35:19,226
Okay?

3613
02:35:19,227 --> 02:35:20,894
So, you know, we can come in,

3614
02:35:20,895 --> 02:35:22,854
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3615
02:35:22,855 --> 02:35:24,064
Nobody gives a fuck.

3616
02:35:24,065 --> 02:35:25,758
I'm gonna win.

3617
02:35:25,817 --> 02:35:27,294
You, sir.

3618
02:35:28,736 --> 02:35:30,554
Are what's known

3619
02:35:31,489 --> 02:35:32,739
as a Grenada.

3620
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:33,932
Hmm.

3621
02:35:35,785 --> 02:35:38,245
You're looking at real prison time.

3622
02:35:38,246 --> 02:35:39,329
Hmm.

3623
02:35:39,330 --> 02:35:41,728
Money laundering can get you
as much as 20 years.

3624
02:35:42,625 --> 02:35:45,418
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3625
02:35:45,419 --> 02:35:47,170
shoving cash in your mattress.

3626
02:35:47,171 --> 02:35:48,318
Is that right?

3627
02:35:49,090 --> 02:35:51,613
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3628
02:35:52,218 --> 02:35:56,096
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3629
02:35:56,097 --> 02:35:57,870
that's not our ambition here.

3630
02:35:59,141 --> 02:36:01,768
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3631
02:36:01,769 --> 02:36:05,043
We think they need to
see their day in court as well.

3632
02:36:07,525 --> 02:36:09,609
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3633
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:12,384
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3634
02:36:13,489 --> 02:36:16,366
Full cooperation. He provides
us with a comprehensive list

3635
02:36:16,367 --> 02:36:18,785
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3636
02:36:18,786 --> 02:36:20,871
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3637
02:36:20,872 --> 02:36:22,205
Wait...

3638
02:36:22,206 --> 02:36:24,040
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3639
02:36:24,041 --> 02:36:25,375
A wire. Mmm-hmm.

3640
02:36:25,376 --> 02:36:26,793
What does that mean?

3641
02:36:26,794 --> 02:36:28,753
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3642
02:36:28,754 --> 02:36:30,130
No, I want you to cooperate.

3643
02:36:30,131 --> 02:36:32,132
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3644
02:36:32,133 --> 02:36:35,658
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3645
02:36:40,057 --> 02:36:41,975
How was Cristy's party?

3646
02:36:41,976 --> 02:36:43,143
Fine.

3647
02:36:43,144 --> 02:36:44,587
Good.

3648
02:36:45,646 --> 02:36:48,189
Babe, I spoke to the
lawyers again today.

3649
02:36:48,190 --> 02:36:50,942
I have some really,
really great news.

3650
02:36:50,943 --> 02:36:52,386
Mmm-hmm.

3651
02:36:52,695 --> 02:36:55,389
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3652
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:57,991
I know that already.

3653
02:36:57,992 --> 02:36:59,389
Right. Exactly.

3654
02:36:59,702 --> 02:37:03,022
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3655
02:37:03,748 --> 02:37:06,067
It turns out, all the FBI really

3656
02:37:06,626 --> 02:37:08,603
wants from me is to, uh,

3657
02:37:08,794 --> 02:37:10,396
to cooperate.

3658
02:37:10,504 --> 02:37:11,838
You know?

3659
02:37:11,839 --> 02:37:13,214
Turns out I have so
much information

3660
02:37:13,215 --> 02:37:14,883
about the stock market
and Wall Street,

3661
02:37:14,884 --> 02:37:16,092
I could save the government

3662
02:37:16,093 --> 02:37:18,094
years of heartache, not to mention

3663
02:37:18,095 --> 02:37:20,573
- countless dollars.
- Mmm-hmm.

3664
02:37:20,890 --> 02:37:23,334
But it gets even better, babe.

3665
02:37:23,684 --> 02:37:26,333
Because if I do
decide to cooperate,

3666
02:37:26,646 --> 02:37:29,522
I might only be
looking at four short years,

3667
02:37:29,523 --> 02:37:31,107
in which case, you know,

3668
02:37:31,108 --> 02:37:34,194
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3669
02:37:34,195 --> 02:37:35,946
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3670
02:37:35,947 --> 02:37:37,822
wouldn't be due till
after I serve my term,

3671
02:37:37,823 --> 02:37:40,200
so we'd still have plenty of
money left over, you know?

3672
02:37:40,201 --> 02:37:41,723
Mmm-hmm.

3673
02:37:42,745 --> 02:37:45,246
The only thing that of course
bummed me out a little bit

3674
02:37:45,247 --> 02:37:47,600
is this whole idea of having to

3675
02:37:48,125 --> 02:37:50,377
give information about my friends.

3676
02:37:50,378 --> 02:37:53,713
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3677
02:37:53,714 --> 02:37:55,715
Right. Right. Exactly.

3678
02:37:55,716 --> 02:37:57,384
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3679
02:37:57,385 --> 02:37:59,177
Because they said eventually...

3680
02:37:59,178 --> 02:38:02,138
Eventually everyone's gonna have to
give information on this case.

3681
02:38:02,139 --> 02:38:05,016
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3682
02:38:05,017 --> 02:38:07,227
Well, that's good news. Right?

3683
02:38:07,228 --> 02:38:09,062
Yeah, yeah.

3684
02:38:09,063 --> 02:38:10,836
I'm really happy for you.

3685
02:38:12,149 --> 02:38:15,503
What do you mean, happy for me,
sweetheart?

3686
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,989
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3687
02:38:18,990 --> 02:38:21,013
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3688
02:38:23,035 --> 02:38:24,728
Come here, baby.

3689
02:38:25,162 --> 02:38:26,746
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3690
02:38:26,747 --> 02:38:27,872
Jordan...

3691
02:38:27,873 --> 02:38:29,124
Oh, come on, baby.

3692
02:38:29,125 --> 02:38:31,418
I haven't made love to
you in so long. Please.

3693
02:38:31,419 --> 02:38:33,920
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3694
02:38:33,921 --> 02:38:35,489
No! Jordan, stop it!

3695
02:38:37,091 --> 02:38:39,410
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3696
02:38:43,222 --> 02:38:45,199
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3697
02:38:45,683 --> 02:38:48,332
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3698
02:38:49,103 --> 02:38:51,126
You know how much I
love you, right?

3699
02:38:51,522 --> 02:38:53,795
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3700
02:38:58,946 --> 02:39:01,048
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3701
02:39:02,742 --> 02:39:04,560
You wanna fuck me?

3702
02:39:05,453 --> 02:39:06,619
Good.

3703
02:39:06,620 --> 02:39:08,063
Go ahead.

3704
02:39:08,456 --> 02:39:10,524
Go ahead and fuck me.

3705
02:39:11,459 --> 02:39:14,002
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3706
02:39:14,003 --> 02:39:16,796
I want you to fuck me
like it's the last fucking time.

3707
02:39:16,797 --> 02:39:18,173
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3708
02:39:18,174 --> 02:39:19,257
Please hold still.

3709
02:39:19,258 --> 02:39:20,884
'Cause I want you to
come for me, baby.

3710
02:39:20,885 --> 02:39:22,302
Come on, babe.

3711
02:39:22,303 --> 02:39:23,845
Come for me, baby.

3712
02:39:23,846 --> 02:39:25,138
I want you to come for me

3713
02:39:25,139 --> 02:39:26,723
like it's the last fucking time.

3714
02:39:26,724 --> 02:39:28,266
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3715
02:39:28,267 --> 02:39:30,935
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3716
02:39:30,936 --> 02:39:32,145
Come on, baby.

3717
02:39:32,146 --> 02:39:33,521
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3718
02:39:33,522 --> 02:39:35,565
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3719
02:39:35,566 --> 02:39:36,838
Yeah.

3720
02:39:37,568 --> 02:39:39,611
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3721
02:39:39,612 --> 02:39:42,056
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3722
02:39:43,783 --> 02:39:45,575
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3723
02:39:45,576 --> 02:39:48,179
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3724
02:39:49,371 --> 02:39:51,815
Oh, God.

3725
02:39:52,374 --> 02:39:53,917
Oh, God.

3726
02:39:53,918 --> 02:39:55,270
Jesus.

3727
02:39:58,798 --> 02:40:00,173
Oh, baby.

3728
02:40:00,174 --> 02:40:02,801
That was so fucking great!

3729
02:40:02,802 --> 02:40:04,154
Oh, God!

3730
02:40:06,430 --> 02:40:08,453
That was the last time.

3731
02:40:08,849 --> 02:40:10,892
What do you mean, baby?

3732
02:40:10,893 --> 02:40:13,963
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3733
02:40:14,855 --> 02:40:17,049
What are you talking about?

3734
02:40:18,943 --> 02:40:20,670
I want a divorce.

3735
02:40:22,196 --> 02:40:24,239
What do you mean,
you want a divorce?

3736
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:26,366
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3737
02:40:26,367 --> 02:40:28,390
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3738
02:40:28,619 --> 02:40:29,953
You just made love to me.

3739
02:40:29,954 --> 02:40:31,121
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3740
02:40:31,122 --> 02:40:33,566
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3741
02:40:34,708 --> 02:40:36,810
Oh, you don't love me?

3742
02:40:37,086 --> 02:40:38,795
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3743
02:40:38,796 --> 02:40:41,089
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3744
02:40:41,090 --> 02:40:43,049
Now that I'm under
federal indictment,

3745
02:40:43,050 --> 02:40:45,051
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3746
02:40:45,052 --> 02:40:46,886
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3747
02:40:46,887 --> 02:40:48,705
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3748
02:40:48,973 --> 02:40:51,307
What kind of person are you?
Tell me.

3749
02:40:51,308 --> 02:40:52,642
You married me!

3750
02:40:52,643 --> 02:40:54,227
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

3751
02:40:54,228 --> 02:40:55,979
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3752
02:40:55,980 --> 02:40:58,231
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3753
02:40:58,232 --> 02:41:00,316
If you agree to the
divorce right now,

3754
02:41:00,317 --> 02:41:01,901
I will allow visitation.

3755
02:41:01,902 --> 02:41:03,820
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3756
02:41:03,821 --> 02:41:05,321
It'll save us both a lot of money

3757
02:41:05,322 --> 02:41:08,050
and I got a feeling
you're gonna need it.

3758
02:41:09,535 --> 02:41:12,829
You're not taking my kids,
sweetheart. You hear me?

3759
02:41:12,830 --> 02:41:14,330
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3760
02:41:14,331 --> 02:41:15,582
He said even if you
don't get convicted,

3761
02:41:15,583 --> 02:41:16,833
I've got a good chance
of getting them.

3762
02:41:16,834 --> 02:41:18,001
I got news for you.

3763
02:41:18,002 --> 02:41:19,752
You're not fucking
taking my children,

3764
02:41:19,753 --> 02:41:21,526
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3765
02:41:21,922 --> 02:41:24,007
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3766
02:41:24,008 --> 02:41:26,259
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3767
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:27,703
You hear me? Fuck you!

3768
02:41:27,845 --> 02:41:30,698
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3769
02:41:39,190 --> 02:41:41,024
Fucking bitch!

3770
02:41:43,444 --> 02:41:44,861
Fucking whore!

3771
02:41:49,158 --> 02:41:51,977
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3772
02:42:01,003 --> 02:42:03,880
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3773
02:42:03,881 --> 02:42:05,131
You're sick!

3774
02:42:05,132 --> 02:42:06,382
You're a sick man!

3775
02:42:06,383 --> 02:42:08,468
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3776
02:42:08,469 --> 02:42:11,054
You think I would let
my kids near you?

3777
02:42:11,055 --> 02:42:12,305
Look at yourself!

3778
02:42:12,306 --> 02:42:13,848
You know what my lawyer said?

3779
02:42:13,849 --> 02:42:17,435
My lawyer said that you're going to
prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3780
02:42:17,436 --> 02:42:20,772
Twenty fucking years! You're
never gonna see the kids again!

3781
02:42:20,773 --> 02:42:22,023
You don't think I'm
not gonna see my...

3782
02:42:22,024 --> 02:42:23,900
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3783
02:42:23,901 --> 02:42:26,152
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3784
02:42:26,153 --> 02:42:27,755
Don't you fucking touch them!

3785
02:42:28,989 --> 02:42:30,932
Don't you fucking touch me!

3786
02:42:32,493 --> 02:42:35,828
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3787
02:42:35,829 --> 02:42:37,931
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3788
02:42:40,584 --> 02:42:42,919
Don't you fucking touch her,
Jordan.

3789
02:42:42,920 --> 02:42:45,773
I swear to God,
I will fucking kill you!

3790
02:42:48,342 --> 02:42:49,676
It's all right, baby.

3791
02:42:49,677 --> 02:42:51,010
You and Daddy are gonna go

3792
02:42:51,011 --> 02:42:52,470
on a little trip together, okay?

3793
02:42:52,471 --> 02:42:54,097
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3794
02:42:54,098 --> 02:42:55,265
Violet!

3795
02:42:55,266 --> 02:42:57,517
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3796
02:42:57,518 --> 02:42:59,227
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3797
02:42:59,228 --> 02:43:02,146
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3798
02:43:02,147 --> 02:43:03,523
There you go. Get your legs in.

3799
02:43:03,524 --> 02:43:05,275
I'm taking her with me!

3800
02:43:05,276 --> 02:43:06,567
I told you I'm taking her with me,

3801
02:43:06,568 --> 02:43:07,986
you fucking bitch!

3802
02:43:07,987 --> 02:43:10,806
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3803
02:43:11,490 --> 02:43:13,638
We're going on a
little trip, honey.

3804
02:43:13,993 --> 02:43:15,595
No! No!

3805
02:43:16,078 --> 02:43:17,537
Get the hell out of here!

3806
02:43:17,538 --> 02:43:19,789
Leave that baby alone!

3807
02:43:19,790 --> 02:43:22,041
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3808
02:43:22,042 --> 02:43:23,251
Mommy!

3809
02:43:23,252 --> 02:43:25,545
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3810
02:43:25,546 --> 02:43:27,148
Mommy!

3811
02:43:30,551 --> 02:43:32,278
No!

3812
02:43:39,476 --> 02:43:42,312
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3813
02:43:42,313 --> 02:43:43,688
Get the baby!

3814
02:43:43,689 --> 02:43:45,917
Naomi, get the baby!

3815
02:43:46,567 --> 02:43:48,276
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3816
02:43:48,277 --> 02:43:49,652
It's gonna be okay.

3817
02:43:49,653 --> 02:43:51,755
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3818
02:43:52,656 --> 02:43:54,532
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

3819
02:43:54,533 --> 02:43:56,200
She all right?

3820
02:43:56,201 --> 02:43:57,553
Is she all right?

3821
02:43:58,245 --> 02:43:59,892
What's the matter with you?

3822
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:01,523
Is she all right?

3823
02:44:08,756 --> 02:44:10,256
<i>Paragraph 1.</i>

3824
02:44:10,257 --> 02:44:11,841

Breathe normally.

<i>Including wearing
a recording device,</i>

3835
02:44:28,442 --> 02:44:30,193

3838

Fucking brutal.

3839
02:44:35,282 --> 02:44:36,616
Quit your bitching.

3840

Paragraph 4.
The defendant must not commit,

3841

any further crimes.

3842
02:44:40,788 --> 02:44:44,374
Please. Let me just sign
the fucking thing already.

3843
02:44:44,375 --> 02:44:45,852
Thank you.

3844
02:44:48,670 --> 02:44:49,962
Just here?

3845
02:44:49,963 --> 02:44:51,565
That'd be good.

3846
02:44:53,217 --> 02:44:54,425
Thank you.

3847
02:44:54,426 --> 02:44:56,153
<i>It wasn't even a choice.</i>

3848
02:44:57,096 --> 02:45:00,200
<i>For the next six hours,
I came up with a list.</i>

3849
02:45:00,391 --> 02:45:03,351
<i>Friends, enemies,
business associates.</i>

3850
02:45:03,352 --> 02:45:05,144
<i>Anybody who 'd ever known me</i>

3851
02:45:05,145 --> 02:45:07,522
<i>or taken so much as a stock tip.</i>

3852
02:45:12,986 --> 02:45:15,430
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3853
02:45:17,116 --> 02:45:18,889
<i>The first name on the
list was Donnie.</i>

3854
02:45:22,287 --> 02:45:23,830
Jordan, do you know how good it is

3855
02:45:23,831 --> 02:45:25,524
to have you back in this office?

3856
02:45:25,791 --> 02:45:27,917
It's not the same when you're gone.

3857
02:45:27,918 --> 02:45:29,710
It's sad, you understand?
It's like...

3858
02:45:29,711 --> 02:45:31,254
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3859
02:45:31,255 --> 02:45:32,505
I can't...

3860
02:45:32,506 --> 02:45:34,382
Swear to God, I can't
even think about it.

3861
02:45:34,383 --> 02:45:36,342
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3862
02:45:36,343 --> 02:45:38,136
I can't even say his name.

3863
02:45:38,137 --> 02:45:39,762
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3864
02:45:39,763 --> 02:45:42,181
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3865
02:45:42,182 --> 02:45:43,329
Ugh!

3866
02:45:43,392 --> 02:45:46,462
He ever get back to
you about that, um...

3867
02:45:47,104 --> 02:45:49,081
About that account?

3868
02:45:54,695 --> 02:45:55,820
You remember.

3869
02:45:55,821 --> 02:45:57,864
It was like 4 or 5 mil,
something like that, right?

3870
02:45:57,865 --> 02:46:01,139
He was supposed
to kick back 4 or 5 mil, was it?

3871
02:46:05,456 --> 02:46:06,998
Actually, I was...

3872
02:46:06,999 --> 02:46:08,458
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3873
02:46:08,459 --> 02:46:10,042
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3874
02:46:10,043 --> 02:46:12,145
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3875
02:46:12,713 --> 02:46:14,338
Well, if he calls you,

3876
02:46:14,339 --> 02:46:16,817
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3877
02:46:18,552 --> 02:46:20,303
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

3878
02:46:20,304 --> 02:46:22,498
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3879
02:46:25,809 --> 02:46:28,412
You gonna eat that last piece
of yellowtail, bud?

3880
02:46:29,354 --> 02:46:31,172
No, it's all yours.

3881
02:46:31,899 --> 02:46:33,342
Can I get this?

3882
02:46:35,736 --> 02:46:37,588
So, what else is...

3883
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:42,325
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3884
02:46:42,326 --> 02:46:43,784
You know how it is.

3885
02:46:43,785 --> 02:46:46,013
She hates my fucking guts.

3886
02:46:47,623 --> 02:46:49,441
How's Hildy? Good?

3887
02:46:50,167 --> 02:46:51,626
She's still alive, so

3888
02:46:51,627 --> 02:46:53,794
my life is fucked, you know?

3889
02:46:53,795 --> 02:46:55,112
Yeah.

3890
02:47:01,803 --> 02:47:03,405
Mr. Jordan.

3891
02:47:03,514 --> 02:47:04,866
Mmm?

3892
02:47:04,973 --> 02:47:07,292
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3893
02:47:07,559 --> 02:47:08,706
What?

3894
02:47:09,061 --> 02:47:10,913
You've got a visitor.

3895
02:47:26,328 --> 02:47:28,454
I need you to get dressed.

3896
02:47:28,455 --> 02:47:30,728
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3897
02:47:35,671 --> 02:47:37,489
You're going to jail.

3898
02:47:49,434 --> 02:47:50,685
All right.

3899
02:47:50,686 --> 02:47:52,228
I'll get some clothes on.

3900
02:47:52,229 --> 02:47:54,548
We'll give you a hand with that.

3901
02:48:03,323 --> 02:48:04,470
Okay.

3902
02:48:16,628 --> 02:48:17,945
FBI!

3903
02:48:18,297 --> 02:48:19,839
Everybody sit down. Put your hands

3904
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:21,966
where they can be seen,
and shut up!

3905
02:48:21,967 --> 02:48:23,759
Don't you fucking touch me.

3906
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:25,970
Get your fucking hands off me!

3907
02:48:25,971 --> 02:48:27,789
Don't get out of your seats!

3908
02:48:40,944 --> 02:48:42,637
It's fucking Chanel!

3909
02:48:55,208 --> 02:48:57,402
<i>I gave up everyone.</i>

3910
02:48:57,461 --> 02:48:59,045
<i>And in return,</i>

3911
02:48:59,046 --> 02:49:03,492
<i>I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.</i>

3912
02:49:05,302 --> 02:49:07,780
<i>Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,</i>

3913
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:11,158
<i>"The chickens had
come home to roost."</i>

3914
02:49:12,434 --> 02:49:14,787
<i>Whatever the fuck that means.</i>

3915
02:49:18,231 --> 02:49:19,607
<i>I hope Your Honor would agree</i>

3916
02:49:19,608 --> 02:49:21,734
that Mr. Belfort has
distinguished himself

3917
02:49:21,735 --> 02:49:23,903
in terms of his cooperation.

3918
02:49:23,904 --> 02:49:26,030
Mr. Belfort has helped the
government win convictions

3919
02:49:26,031 --> 02:49:28,680
of over two dozen serious offenders

3920
02:49:29,785 --> 02:49:31,786
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3921
02:49:31,787 --> 02:49:35,357
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3922
02:49:37,501 --> 02:49:39,043
The sentence of the court shall be

3923
02:49:39,044 --> 02:49:41,272
36 months in federal prison.

3924
02:49:42,964 --> 02:49:45,192
Please remand the defendant.

3925
02:49:47,302 --> 02:49:49,154
I'm sorry.

3926
02:49:51,932 --> 02:49:53,079
That's okay.

3927
02:50:41,356 --> 02:50:43,899
<i>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</i>

3928
02:50:43,900 --> 02:50:45,818
<i>When we arrived at the prison,</i>

3929
02:50:45,819 --> 02:50:48,092
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i>

3930
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:50,197
Belfort, on your feet.

3931
02:50:50,198 --> 02:50:52,596
<i>But I needn't have been.</i>

3932
02:50:52,743 --> 02:50:55,437
<i>You see, for a brief
fleeting moment,</i>
