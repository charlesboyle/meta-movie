1
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:13,524
<i>I'm Stephanie Plum,</i>

2
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:15,560
<i>and this is... my story.</i>

3
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:17,505
<i>I was born and raised
in the blue collar</i>

4
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:18,980
<i>town of Trenton called the Burke.</i>

5
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,775
<i>Here, houses are modest,
yards are small...</i>

6
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:24,156
<i>and cars are American.</i>

7
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:27,830
- Stephanie!
- Hey... guys!

8
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,742
<i>And at this point in my life,
I have no food in my fridge,</i>

9
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,421
<i>four dollars and checking...</i>

10
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:35,041
<i>And I'm driving to my parents' house
in a car I can no longer afford.</i>

11
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,097
- Your father needs to eat!
- I'm coming.

12
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:41,338
<i>The clock on the dash told me
I was five minutes late.</i>

13
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:44,738
<i>My life time with my mother told me
she think that meant I was dead.</i>

14
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,300
- I though you were dead.
- Five minutes late, Mom.

15
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,061
- What's for dinner?
- Pot roast.

16
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,182
Dried out but not roast.

17
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,627
<i>As for my dad,
those five minutes were spend</i>

18
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:57,283
<i>contemplating how to
kill Grandma Mazur,</i>

19
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:59,146
<i>and where to bury the body.</i>

20
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,335
Guess who died?

21
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:03,692
I read it today. You'd never guess.

22
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,451
Jimmy.

23
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,615
With the bumpy ears.
Seventy-two. Dead... electrocuted.

24
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:11,828
Ma!

25
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,119
His poor mother...

26
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:16,667
You are not eating.

27
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,295
I've got some not so great news.

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,784
- You found a lump?
- Come on!

29
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:26,431
- No! I've got let go from Macy's.
- Those bastards!

30
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:29,829
- 6 months ago.
- 6 months? You just now telling me?

31
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,561
- For the love of God...
- I know. I know.

32
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:36,517
I've got maybe 10 minutes left
with the car, so... that's my news.

33
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,119
What I need to get is a...

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,748
- ... job.
- Husband.

35
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,364
Bernie Kuntz is single.

36
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:47,545
Ma, I had a husband, I didn't like it.
I don't want another one.

37
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:50,113
Yes, a job. Because as hard it is
to imagine it...

38
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:54,785
It's just not a lot out there for
a department store lingerie manager.

39
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:56,669
You'd think there would be.

40
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:59,580
Who wouldn't enjoy a nice thong?

41
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,463
Ridiculous!

42
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:08,928
Nobody panic, just them towing my car.

43
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,688
What?

44
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,596
I thought you said 10 more minutes.

45
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:16,355
My judgements a little screwy.

46
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,775
Good judgement is for sissies.

47
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,852
I can't take it anymore!

48
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:29,118
Little FYI, your cousin is looking
for someone to help with the filing.

49
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:31,530
- Which cousin?
- Vinnie.

50
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:34,074
He tried to make out with
me at my own wedding.

51
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,626
He's a flawed individual.

52
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:41,296
This is my place, the appliances

53
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,879
predated my grandmother
but it suits me.

54
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:49,305
I hate to tell you, Rex but you're
going nowhere, that's official.

55
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,731
- Hello...
- Gramp?

56
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,033
You need to look through that peep
hole before you answer the door.

57
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,526
I could have an axe or worse.

58
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,977
- You wanna come in?
- Yeah.

59
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,350
Not so much,
I've got a little something for you.

60
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:20,620
<i>Big Blue!</i>

61
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:23,185
Gramp, I can't take <i>Big Blue.</i>
And how did you get here?

62
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,632
You don't have a driving licence.

63
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,633
What? You're gonna
ride a bus like a gypsy?

64
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,302
People ride the bus all the time.

65
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:31,301
Not when they could be
riding in style.

66
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,891
Alright, thank you.

67
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,075
You know, you might wanna run
a comb through your hair,

68
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:38,100
you'll feel better.

69
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:39,354
I feel fine.

70
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:41,686
Okay, run a comb through your hair
and I'll feel better.

71
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:44,318
Now go get some clothes on
and give me a ride home.

72
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,111
Go on.

73
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,831
<i>This is my cousin Vinnie's business.
Every scumbags and</i>

74
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:50,874
<i>sleazeballs in Trenton had
passed through here but,</i>

75
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:54,900
<i>anything is better than marrying
Bernie Kuntz. So, here I am...</i>

76
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:59,038
Stephanie Plum, swear to Christ,
I thought you were here to make bail.

77
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,039
That would have been sad.

78
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:03,671
You looked confused?
It's me, Connie Rossoli.

79
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:05,919
You graduated Central,
with my little sister, Tina.

80
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,084
Tina Rossoli! Holy crap!
How's she doing?

81
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,514
Not good. Big as a house.

82
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,925
Enough about me and mine. You were
here to see Vinnie, regarding what?

83
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,810
- I heard you guys had a filing job?
- No.

84
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,311
No? What do mean no?

85
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:22,516
Now we moved some files into storage
last week. Two days work.

86
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,600
It's a crappy job, you spend
all days on your knees.

87
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,250
If you're gonna spend that
much time on your knees,

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,502
you could find something that
pays better. You know what I mean.

89
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:31,206
Yeah, you guys got anything?
Full time, part-time,

90
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,748
freelance... just till I get
my feet back on the ground.

91
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,899
Maybe Vinny will let
you do some skips chasing.

92
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,830
How comfortable are you
with the low lifes?

93
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,082
Sold lingerie for 3 years in Newark.

94
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,239
You're good to go.

95
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:46,503
Tell you what, Morty Beyers is down
for the count, ruptured appendix.

96
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:48,899
Disgusting, these are his cases.

97
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,506
Can I look at them?

98
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,553
FTA?

99
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:58,776
"Failure To Appears"
skipped out on bail.

100
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:02,193
Bring him in...
you'll get 10% of the bond, adds up.

101
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:04,398
Yeah? I could do this.

102
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,193
I don't know Steph, you're dealing
with criminals. I got to say "no".

103
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:10,988
I can either apprehend criminals or
becomes one. That's where I met them.

104
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,115
- It's that bad?
- Yeah.

105
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,864
Joe Morelli skipped out on bail?

106
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,654
No, no, no, you stay away from that.
That man's half a million!

107
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,789
I'll give it all up to put
his ass in jail.

108
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,624
Give it all up?
You've got nothing left to give.

109
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,547
Remember you just say,
you've nothing left to give, so...

110
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:29,378
It's a figure of speech, Vin.

111
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,167
I remained unconvinced.

112
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:35,752
Alright, take a couple of civil
cases of Morty, alright.

113
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:37,390
But you stay away from Joe Morelli's.

114
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,868
You mucked it up, I lose my business.

115
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:40,848
His mother will lose the house.
Only bad will come of it.

116
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,603
- I need the 50 grand!
- Nope.

117
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,856
You stuck your tongue in my mouth
at my wedding!

118
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,643
I was drunk, okay!

119
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:51,462
I was drunk, and you resembled someone
else... so there's nothing like it.

120
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,702
I was wearing a big white dress
and a veil.

121
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:55,862
I gave you a job, get.

122
00:07:56,066 --> 00:08:00,287
You know, I used to get my nails done,
by this very chatty manicurist,

123
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:03,162
who moonlights
as a dominatrix of all things.

124
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,669
- How chatty?
- Deeply chatty.

125
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:08,340
How's your wife?

126
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,990
<i>There are some men who
went to a women's life</i>

127
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,319
<i>and screwed it up forever.</i>

128
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:15,885
<i>Joe Morelli did this to me, he was
the big catch in our neighbourhood.</i>

129
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:16,925
<i>And I thought I caught him when</i>

130
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:20,269
<i>I gave him my virginity on the
floor of a tasty pastry bakery,</i>

131
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,101
<i>I worked at when I was seventeen.</i>

132
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,353
<i>Unfortunately for me,
he never call after.</i>

133
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:26,559
Joe?

134
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,522
<i>Unfortunately for him,
I hold a grudge.</i>

135
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,959
It's not like I really thought
he was going to open the door

136
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,487
and followed me to the station,

137
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,275
and collect the bag of money, but...

138
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:41,487
<i>- Can I ask you a question?</i>
- What?

139
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,076
What if he is innocent?

140
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,866
It's not my problem, Mary Lou.

141
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,581
<i>You're my oldest friend,
Stephanie. Let it go.</i>

142
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,044
Crap!

143
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:51,001
Mooch Morelli just pull in here.

144
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,505
Oh wow,

145
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,586
did he lose like 70 pounds?

146
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,760
Yeah, lap band. He got tired of
being known as Joe's fat cousin.

147
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:03,263
<i>Now he's known as Joe's ugly cousin.</i>

148
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:04,813
<i>It's so unfair.</i>

149
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:06,937
No, I think he looks better,
you're not being very nice.

150
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,266
Would you hang up the phone,
and go check the car for clues.

151
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:11,691
Great.

152
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:21,072
Oh shit, shit, shit, shit...

153
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:26,202
Be cool, Steph. Play it cool.

154
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,400
<i>Luckily, Mooch's car wasn't too
hard to follow.</i>

155
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:44,304
<i>It was pretty flashy and yellow.</i>

156
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,542
<i>I think I found my guy.</i>

157
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:09,567
<i>Now, all I have to do... come up
with a plan and bring him in.</i>

158
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,025
Hey!

159
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,812
- What do you want?
- Morelli!

160
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:45,101
Huh!

161
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:46,950
Morelli.

162
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,531
God.

163
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:52,087
Oh Jesus, Stephanie Plum!
What the hell?

164
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:53,585
Wow! Still charming!

165
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,663
Oh, is that the girl who
rammed me over with the car!

166
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,214
That was an accident. My foot slipped.

167
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,607
Accident my ass,
you jumped the goddamn kerb,

168
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,549
broke my leg in three
different places!

169
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,925
I think of you everytime it rains.

170
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:05,845
See... that right there!

171
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,485
Almost charming but not quite.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,935
Heard you moved back here
after your divorce.

173
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,334
Yeah? Well, I heard you killed a guy.

174
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,326
- And?
- And...

175
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,341
You're in violation of
your bond agreement.

176
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,650
I'm gonna need you to come clean.

177
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,367
Vinnie sent you to bring me in?

178
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:21,705
Yeah, you think that's funny?

179
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,861
Yeah I do. And I gotta tell you,

180
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,218
I could use a good joke
these days because...

181
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,995
I haven't had a lot to laugh about
lately. You know what I mean?

182
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:31,521
Okay, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

183
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:32,554
- Hey!
- Hey!

184
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,655
You got no gun, you got no cuffs,
and you got no back-up.

185
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,512
I mean seriously Plum,
thanks for the laugh.

186
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:42,305
What about your mother?

187
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:43,939
What about my mother?

188
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,482
She mortaged her house!

189
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,515
She's gonna lose everything,
Don't you even care?

190
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:48,800
Hey! Listen to me.

191
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,063
- You listen to me!
- God!

192
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:52,461
I'd cut my own throat before I let
you bring me into custody!

193
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,742
Because number one, I am a cop.

194
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:56,252
You know what happens to cop's
in jail? Not pretty.

195
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,389
And number two, you're the last person
I'll let to collect the money.

196
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,905
Because you're the goddamn woman
who's taken to ram me over

197
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:02,684
because I didn't call after
I nailed you.

198
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,033
We're ancient history.
Like the pryamid, baby!

199
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,951
It was an accident!

200
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:11,376
You're going down the road.

201
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,416
God.

202
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,427
I mean it, I'll just come after you!

203
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,097
Fine, I'm getting my keys,
get in my car...

204
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:29,773
I got to say, I liked the way you
let your hair go curly like that.

205
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,102
Such a personality... you know.

206
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,189
It's got a lot of energy.

207
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:38,691
Not much control.

208
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:44,246
Sexy as hell.

209
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:45,784
You know nothing about my personality.

210
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:46,780
Yeah?

211
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,953
But I know about
the sexy as hell part.

212
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,251
Thanks for reminding me.

213
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:06,269
Oh... Oh...

214
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,392
Come on!

215
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,900
Good to see ya, cupcake!

216
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:19,030
You're an animal!

217
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,369
Yes, he was an animal but
we knew that already.

218
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:30,629
Could you moved up a little?
You smell like a dumpster, no offense.

219
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:34,121
Really?
Cause I don't smell it anymore.

220
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:37,126
Fifty grand... dead or alive, huh?

221
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,686
Yeah, Vinnie would lose
his shit if he knew

222
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:42,009
you were face to face
and came up empty.

223
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:48,139
Alright, look, Ricardo Manosso.

224
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,559
Likes to be called Ranger.

225
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,231
Call him in the morning.

226
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,938
Ranger... What, he's an action figure?

227
00:13:56,143 --> 00:14:00,489
<i>Ranger Manosso, the Lord God
guru of bounty hunting.</i>

228
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:03,294
<i>He looks like Michelangelo dipped
his statue of David in caramel,</i>

229
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,384
<i>strapped some heat on him.</i>

230
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,822
Did I catched you in the
middle of a tour of duty?

231
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:10,054
York it up! If it had been
me who clapped Morelli

232
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,209
I'd been sitting on fifty grand
right now.

233
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:15,167
- How's those fries?
- Yeah, they're not bad.

234
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:17,502
Excuse me, can I get some ketchup?

235
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:18,757
Thanks.

236
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,421
So I did a little recon...

237
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,883
the guy Morelli killed, Ziggy Kuleska,
he was moving heroin.

238
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,923
But you knew that already, right?

239
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,758
Yeah, yeah.

240
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,935
Isn't that a little hard on
your stomach?

241
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,631
I could hanged up going after Morelli.

242
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,734
I'm trying to diversify,
private security, things like that.

243
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:38,607
None of your business.

244
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,406
No... Nothing?

245
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:45,408
Seems a little silly, that's all.
You know... food is fuel, so...

246
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:48,658
You're out of your league.
You need to respect that.

247
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:52,844
A - He is a cop. B - He put a bullet
in Ziggy Kuleska head

248
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:54,539
and we don't know the circumstances.

249
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:55,933
Except for C - He was off duty

250
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,502
and he used a personal weapon
with a .45 hydrashock.

251
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,382
Do you even know what that is?

252
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:02,968
It's a gun, I'm not a idiot.

253
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:04,379
A bullet.

254
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:07,640
Entry wound like a BB blows
out a chunk the size of a potato.

255
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,144
You even owned a gun?

256
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,727
Is it bad if I said no?

257
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,777
She wants to ba a badass
recovery agent,

258
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:21,653
she's going after Morelli.

259
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,027
Smith & Wesson five shots.

260
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:27,280
- .38 special?
- Fits in nice in a purse.

261
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:29,411
Look sexy.

262
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,781
You take the gun, honey.

263
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:38,250
- Enchanting in there?
- Yeah!

264
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,210
You mind if I take it for
a test drive?

265
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:50,015
I might like his better.

266
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,602
Look, I got three out of five.

267
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:02,736
Not bad, right?

268
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,690
You might have put a dent
in his golf swing, that's about it.

269
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:09,076
I mean this one just pissed him off.
He'll return fire and killed you.

270
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,907
<i>Verbo!</i>

271
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,831
Yeah, but you just got two.

272
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:17,076
It's a good two but
two out of how many?

273
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,203
I'm just saying I got
three out of five.

274
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:23,041
Or did it ever occured to you that all
my rounds went to the same 2 holes.

275
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,426
Yeah, I don't think so.

276
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,798
Not done.

277
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:49,533
I've got him splatter.

278
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,160
Wow.

279
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,368
Hey listen, I'll go pay for
this gun, okay.

280
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,533
Oh no, I can't let you buy me a gun.

281
00:16:57,699 --> 00:16:59,322
Now Plum, don't flatter yourself,
she won't sell to you.

282
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:01,545
You've got no permit.
You pay me back.

283
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,123
Okay.

284
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,671
May I keep this?

285
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:10,296
Hey, I was just about to call you,
You'll never believe where I am!

286
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,885
I was shooting a gun, how hot is that?

287
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,391
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- In Sunny's.

288
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,348
<i>Ranger teach me how to shoot.
He bought me a gun!</i>

289
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:19,396
Ranger...
What is he, an action figure?

290
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:21,866
I know, right.
He's helping me with this whole

291
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:24,019
bounty hunting thing
so I can nail Morelli.

292
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,063
Not nail Morelli.
You know what I mean.

293
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:28,614
Yeah, I know.

294
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:33,403
What? He skipped bail. He's worth
50 grands. That's it!

295
00:17:34,862 --> 00:17:36,489
- What?
<i>- Alright...</i>

296
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:38,979
I just can't tell if you're actually
in this for the money

297
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,328
or passed this a handy excuse
to chase this guy down.

298
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:45,165
Yeah, I could see where this is going,
so I'm going to hang up, I love you.

299
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,506
<i>If I'm looking for Morelli,
I gotta start with his mom.</i>

300
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,424
I don't care if the Pope
comes to the house and

301
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:53,923
beat me with the stick,
I will never forgive you.

302
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,386
Not ever.

303
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:58,018
I understand that, Mrs. Morelli
but Joe missed his court appearance...

304
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,354
You understand nothing.

305
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,725
Wait till you have a child and some
stone heart comes along in a car

306
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,607
and break his legs that God gave him.

307
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:11,782
Then maybe, you can stand on my step
and tell me you understand.

308
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,285
Okay, but maybe... maybe I could just
give you my number, you know when...

309
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:17,242
A gun?

310
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:19,372
Oh Jesus, what is this world
coming to!

311
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:23,252
Does your mother knows that you're
carrying a gun, Stephanie Plum?

312
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,043
That went well.

313
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:36,415
<i>The only one other person who wants to
find Joe Morelli that more than I do,</i>

314
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,698
<i>is my old friend Eddie Gazarra.</i>

315
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,261
I like the new office.

316
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:42,577
You're moving up in the world,
Eddie... good for you.

317
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:44,807
We both know why I called,
so just get to the point.

318
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,018
The point is, I was still
having a bath and

319
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:48,774
the phone call and tried and
trying to understand.

320
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,902
Hey, this could leave a water mark.

321
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,069
It's laminated, Eddie. It's like
water and a fake plant, relax.

322
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,241
Maybe I'd relax but that would...

323
00:18:57,245 --> 00:19:00,156
Could you please get off the desk.

324
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,666
Maybe I'd relax better if
I didn't get a call from my wife.

325
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:04,246
Shirley the whinner?

326
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:07,205
Hey, that's my wife and your cousin,

327
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,545
who herself got a call
from Lucille Plum.

328
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,924
Vinnie's wife?
You people gotta stop gossiping,

329
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:13,252
what's wrong with everybody?

330
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,501
What's wrong is we're worried.

331
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:16,342
You shouldn't be anywhere
near the Morelli things.

332
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:18,303
Hey, I've as much right to go
after Morelli as anybody.

333
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,217
You don't know anything
about the case.

334
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:22,347
I know the victim's
name is Ziggy Kuleska.

335
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:24,309
I know he was shot by
an off-duty Morelli.

336
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,352
I know the judge posted
bail at half a mil...

337
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,359
And I know Vinnie decided to
put the money up, thinking...

338
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,588
ahh Joe, he's not going to screw me.

339
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:30,003
Wrong.

340
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,265
He skipped as of yesterday,

341
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,436
Morelli was holed up on the 3rd floor
of the Goldcold factory

342
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,319
with access to a borrowed car.
So now he's probably long gone.

343
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,783
- You proud yourself?
- Very. Oh... and

344
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,576
I know, he used a personal weapon,
Hydrashock... with a .45.

345
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:48,202
Goes in like a BB, out like a potato.
So...

346
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,331
That's what I got.

347
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,258
- You're going after him, ain't you?
- Damn skippy.

348
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:02,010
This is Morelli's statement.
Merry christmas and you're welcome.

349
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:08,516
This is Carmen Sanchez. She is
a working girl, mostly Stark Street.

350
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:10,229
- Said she called him for help.
- Yeah.

351
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,153
Morelli got to her apartment,
said Ziggy fired on him first.

352
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,610
He's claiming self-defense, trouble is
Carmen is not around to collaborate.

353
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,445
Said there was another guy there.

354
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,193
Yeah, we can't find him either.

355
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,703
And there's zero evidence
Ziggy ever had a gun.

356
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:23,535
It looks bad.

357
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:28,463
Okay, this will work.

358
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:30,583
Hookers always felt
someone to talk to.

359
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,255
He didn't spare a dime.

360
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,291
She looks like my parolee.

361
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,107
- Oh, I'm all shaking now.
- No, now don't go pretending to be

362
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,931
- Yes... pretend to answer.
- on the phone.

363
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,045
- Yeah?
- Hi!

364
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:42,768
Anyway...

365
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:45,112
You'll see how fast the law be change,
if I was President.

366
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:47,035
If I was the President,
I'll be like this I'm changed

367
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,685
you can believe in.

368
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,941
My mama is bipolar?

369
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:53,245
You wouldn't know how
to be bipolar the way she goes

370
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:55,396
bipolar all over you, you know what.

371
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,151
- Excuse me.
- I'm on the phone.

372
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:58,611
I'm just... I'm looking for a girl.

373
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:01,712
Oh no, you need to keep it moving.

374
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:04,195
Yeah, we're strictly dickly!
Good luck though.

375
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,244
No, no, I mean...

376
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:10,957
I'm looking for this girl.
You know her? Carmen Sanchez.

377
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:13,088
- Okay, bye.
- Yeah, bye

378
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:16,671
Finally! Somebody give
a shit about Carmen.

379
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,173
I need to talk to her about...
about Joe Morelli.

380
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,598
You want to talk about a cop,
look where you at?

381
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:26,260
It's important.
I really need to talk to him.

382
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,683
Oh girl, he got you knocked up.

383
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,021
No!

384
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,644
Well, I can't help you with the cop,

385
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:34,523
but you want to know shit about
Carmen, talk to the boyfriend.

386
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,194
- Hey, red chick!
- Yeah!

387
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:39,778
Uh-huh, you better not be thinking
about asking her to go for a ride.

388
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,284
You ask me. This is my corner, see.

389
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:43,781
Who is her boyfriend?

390
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:47,031
Benito Ramirez. Stark Street gym.

391
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:51,084
Hmm! Just like that, huh?
Giving out details to the white girl.

392
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:53,787
No no no, its good, I'm good.

393
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:55,793
I promised. Trust me.

394
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:59,752
Thank you. This gym right here?

395
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,261
Thank you.

396
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,173
- What's you do that for?
- But...

397
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:06,512
The girl was blocking my sign.

398
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:19,508
Come on, come on!
Give it all you've got, man!

399
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,272
When I fought, we used brass
knuckles and baseball bats,

400
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,656
not these padded gloves, you nancy's.

401
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:28,409
Hey girlscout, what happen?
You lose your troops, huh.

402
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,594
Jimmy Alpha, virile,
single... met ya.

403
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:32,701
How can I be of help?

404
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,207
Stephanie Plum, recovery agent.

405
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:39,417
Oh, bounty hunter, eh?
Quicker picker upper.

406
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,961
Hey, Sean... Sean!

407
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,971
One, one... elbow! Come on!

408
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,925
Harder! Harder! You see, all you
hit is a sweet 16 pillow fight.

409
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,307
Is there somewhere else
we could go to talk?

410
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,856
Yeah, sure.

411
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:57,684
Too much of star's room
for you, officer.

412
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:01,523
No, no. Not an officer, not a cop.

413
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:07,574
So, Mr. Alpha, I'm going after
a guy named Joe Morelli.

414
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:10,075
Yeah well, I don't know him.
That's the truth.

415
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,078
Actually, Joe's not the guy
I'm looking for.

416
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,614
Yeah but that's what you just said.

417
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:15,460
How can I help you if
you're not being honest.

418
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:17,838
He killed the guy named Ziggy Kuleska.

419
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,215
Ziggy Kuleska.

420
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:21,414
You know, when I first met him,

421
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:22,842
I don't know what name to
make fun of first.

422
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,878
What a ridiculous name, eh?

423
00:23:25,045 --> 00:23:27,639
What a dirtbag, tried to horn in
on one of my deal with the fighter.

424
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,060
Benito Ramirez?

425
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:31,148
Yeah, Benito.
You know, I took in Benito

426
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,221
when he was just a kid,
fourteen years old.

427
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:36,682
Give him all my time, make sure he ate
right, give him a place to crash.

428
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,692
Well, I'm looking for Benito's
girlfriend, Carmen Sanchez.

429
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,445
Alright, first you looking for Morelli
and then you're looking Benito,

430
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:43,612
and now you're looking for Carmen.

431
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:46,115
I mean, if you're trying to confuse
me, you've done a great job.

432
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:47,989
Just pick one.

433
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:50,203
Carmen.

434
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:52,618
Look, I'm going to be honest with you.

435
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:56,918
Sometimes I don't even know what to
do with Benito, you know what I mean?

436
00:23:57,077 --> 00:24:00,251
Look, I wish I could be more help
to you, but I got to go.

437
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:03,548
You know, I'd dropped this if
I were you.

438
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,529
Cause these guys got
a taste for violence

439
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,155
which I personally don't condone

440
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:08,558
but what're you gonna do,
you know what I mean.

441
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,664
Eeeoww!

442
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,890
Mr. Ramirez?

443
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:22,595
Get up!

444
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:27,820
- Who are you?
- I need to ask you a few questions.

445
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:30,531
You need to step into my office.

446
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,663
Does he need help?

447
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,257
My name's Stephanie Plum.

448
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:46,084
I'm a bond recovery agent.

449
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,255
Very fancy title.

450
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:52,265
Wow! That's quite a grip.

451
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,844
Jimmy Alpha told me to talk to you.

452
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,617
Do you need me to beat the
shit out of somebody?

453
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:04,682
No, thank you, that's
a very nice offer though.

454
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:06,899
I'm trying to find Carmen Sanchez.

455
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:10,238
We have a lot to talk about, lets go.

456
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:16,073
Okay.

457
00:25:16,323 --> 00:25:17,415
What's your problem?

458
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:19,214
You know what, I'm supposed
to be meeting Sergeant Gazarro

459
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,919
down at the station,
so I'm just gonna get...

460
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:27,084
If you lie to me, I'll cut you up
 and sold you for parts.

461
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:52,275
- Oh God!
- You okay?

462
00:25:52,442 --> 00:25:53,785
What the hell were you doing, huh?

463
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,028
- Looking for you.
- Yeah... well.

464
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,538
Congratulations. You found me.
You also blew my cover.

465
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,118
Now stop rambling at me!

466
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:04,124
- Knock it off!
- Jesus christ!

467
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:07,211
I'm so close to blowing your head off
right now, you don't even know!

468
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:08,003
- Whoa!
- Who would blame me, eh!

469
00:26:08,004 --> 00:26:10,756
You shot an unarmed man,
you skipped bail.

470
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,546
Why're you still moving?

471
00:26:13,547 --> 00:26:15,094
Cause I don't think
you're gonna shoot me.

472
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:17,224
Think again, Morelli.

473
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,140
I don't have to.

474
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:22,806
You could have shot Ramirez back
there and what did you do?

475
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,439
You hit him with your pocket book.

476
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,727
I on the other hand did not
provoked you in anyway.

477
00:26:26,893 --> 00:26:29,146
As far as you're concerned,
I am always provoked.

478
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:33,449
Alright, correction. I have not
provoked you recently, right... Steph?

479
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,202
Come on, will you?

480
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,329
Would you please not shoot me.

481
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:40,161
It's me!

482
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,992
Would you please not shoot me.

483
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,912
Fine.

484
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,747
Would you come into custody then?

485
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,623
No... bullet!

486
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,792
Goddamn it! Joe! You owed me!

487
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,423
Oh, I owed you eh? How did you figure,
I saved your ass back there!

488
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:55,588
My ass, I was fine. I had it handled.

489
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:57,145
That guy been charged with
rape three times,

490
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:59,456
and all three times he walked
because the vics disappeared.

491
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:01,269
Yes, so consider your ass saved.

492
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:03,681
You're watching Ramirez... why?

493
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,925
- You kid me?
- I gave you my gun.

494
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:08,277
Come on, give me something.

495
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:12,447
I will give you something...

496
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,441
Give me something I can use.

497
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:18,612
Alright, you've got one question,
cause I can feel sorry for you.

498
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:20,621
Hurry up, make it good.

499
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:24,250
Who is Carmen?

500
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:26,791
- She is my informant.
- And?

501
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:29,214
And in exchange for information,
I protect her.

502
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,340
I need to know what happened,
I owed her that.

503
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,510
I think Ramirez make her disappeared.

504
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,593
I'd been watching from across the
street, trying to get a read on it.

505
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,555
Until you came along and I'd to
blow the whole place up!

506
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:42,936
Here, don't monkey around with that.

507
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:48,604
Sweatshirt! At least you
look like you're on a bond.

508
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,644
Yeah... what can I say,
I'm a wanted man.

509
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,938
Shit!

510
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:55,065
Oh crap!

511
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:56,991
- Who broke my window, huh?
- Hey,

512
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,115
keep your voice down!

513
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,417
So, I gave you one question
back there, right?

514
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,966
How come you didn't asked
if I'm innocent?

515
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,380
It's for the jury, Joe.
I'm just here to collect.

516
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:24,310
Catch me if you can, cupcake.

517
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,764
I think I can.

518
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:29,641
We'll see about that.

519
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:40,999
<i>I'm twelve minutes late for dinner,</i>

520
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,163
<i>which mean my mother's probably
listening for sirens.</i>

521
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:46,961
- I'm starving.
- Great.

522
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:49,516
This evening we've turkey with

523
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:51,421
pineapple upside down cake,
your favorite.

524
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:52,640
Something's up.

525
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:54,202
What's Bernie Kuntz doing here,

526
00:28:54,203 --> 00:28:55,717
are you guys buying a new TV
or something?

527
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,243
I told his mother,
his biological clock is ticking.

528
00:28:58,244 --> 00:28:58,964
Mom.

529
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:03,035
- Hey Bernie.
- Hey Steph! Long time, right!

530
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:04,680
Yes, a couple of years at least.
How've you been?

531
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,971
- Good, good. And you?
- Great.

532
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,117
I like your hair.

533
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:10,390
Oh thanks,
it's just the same as always.

534
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:12,059
I like always, so...

535
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:20,627
Real good, Mrs. Plum... hmm.

536
00:29:20,637 --> 00:29:21,627
Thank you.

537
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:28,204
So, how's the appliances business,
Bernie?

538
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:30,126
Booming...

539
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:37,880
Stephanie... started a new job.

540
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,718
Yeah... I did, just got a gun.

541
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,594
Oh, she's kidding.

542
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,093
- Oh Mom!
- Five shots!

543
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:49,562
Good for you.

544
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,414
Thanks.

545
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:53,065
Good for yourself.

546
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:56,361
Yeah, doing the bounty hunting thing,
we're going after Joe Morelli.

547
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:58,195
Didn't you run him over with a car?

548
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,740
Ugly rumor. Never happened.

549
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:04,778
Morelli, eh? Really?

550
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:07,117
I know the guy shot...

551
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,704
- Ziggy something, right?
- Ziggy Kuleska, yeah... that's right.

552
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:15,213
I didn't know him... know him,
sold him a plasma for the Superbowl's.

553
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:18,045
You'd see him playing the numbers
at the butcher across the street.

554
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,172
Yeah? Which... which shop?

555
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:22,929
Sal's. It's a real good business.

556
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,580
There are the gurus at CNBC said
foot traffic's dead,

557
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:28,197
all's I know, I hang a sign...

558
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,962
in my windows,
all the guy's making book at Sal's

559
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,481
buy their TVs and what-not from me.

560
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:35,149
Put the gun away, Ma!

561
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:36,434
On account of the signage.

562
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,224
Put it away, don't even try.

563
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:41,610
Now look what you did.

564
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,775
- She belongs in a home.
- Frank!

565
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,070
Shut the suckering grumpy!

566
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,455
It's like fireworks! Made in meat.

567
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:52,041
Look at you.

568
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,124
Didn't the two of you like
the big green apple...

569
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,962
It was high school.

570
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,835
I'm going after him
for the money, period!

571
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,260
Nothing else.

572
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,590
Dolly honey, you lacked vision.

573
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,387
<i>All I know, Bernie handled
the evening pretty well,</i>

574
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:15,432
<i>he hadn't wet his pants when grandma
Mazur shot the turkey's pecker off</i>

575
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:18,192
<i>and he'd given me a clue
to help catch Morelli.</i>

576
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:21,446
<i>Ziggy Kuleska was a scumbag,
a gambler and a crook.</i>

577
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,756
Not that I knew what to do
with this information but

578
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,559
at least it's something.

579
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,452
Come on.

580
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,373
Yeah?

581
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,833
Someone needs to shut you up,
<i>sew up that pretty little mouth.</i>

582
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,372
How did you get this number?

583
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:41,917
You want something bad enough,
<i>you figured out a way get it.</i>

584
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,561
You know it's not like
I can call the police,

585
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:48,511
they already think
I'm in over my head.

586
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,791
Yeah well, I'm not going to lie.
It's not good that he's calling you,

587
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:51,927
but it's good that he's riled up.

588
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,469
It means he'll get sloppy.

589
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:54,733
It's easy for you to say.

590
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:56,062
You probably know the
vulcan grip or something,

591
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:58,600
all I know how to do is swing a purse.

592
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:02,515
People even learn how to do
stuff like this.

593
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:03,802
On the fly, babe.

594
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,616
There we go.

595
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,487
Alright, we're looking for
anything that says this guy

596
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:13,332
got a lifestyles beyond his means,
or links him to Ziggy.

597
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,627
My guess is, it's already picked clean
but you never know. Good luck.

598
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:21,928
- You're not coming in?
- No, no, no.

599
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:24,634
Someone always has to have the
other's one back, okay... always.

600
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:37,397
<i>It's easy for me to imagine
Morelli's at home, taking showers,</i>

601
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,980
<i>paying bills, breaking hearts.</i>

602
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:42,735
It's just junk.

603
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,487
Okay... junk.

604
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,912
- Nothing.
- Damn, I know it.

605
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:02,164
- Wow Plum, that's some grim shit!
- Right!

606
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,416
You know it's kind of hard
to blend in a car like that.

607
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:05,271
Once you're seen, you're seen.

608
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:08,302
Which is why...

609
00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:13,308
Let's see what we got, Joe.

610
00:33:15,102 --> 00:33:15,686
Ooh...

611
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:17,679
An Explorer, neat.

612
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:19,556
- I didn't say a thing.
- Alright then.

613
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:28,193
Solid... hmm.

614
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:36,189
Shit, not again.

615
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,369
Crap! I need cash.

616
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:42,544
Okay... yes.

617
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:44,895
It gonna takes longer than I
thought to get Morelli,

618
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:47,254
but I need to bring someone,
I need money!

619
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,045
Let's see what I've got.

620
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:55,342
Clarence Samson, got drunk at the
Lord and stole a police cruiser.

621
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,956
Take a tour to the bars on Stark,
he's in one of them right now.

622
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:58,743
Easy money.

623
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,563
There's like a thousands bars
on Stark.

624
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:04,145
It'll take forever,
I need fast money, not easy money!

625
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,982
Well, it's not gonna come
knocking on your door, hon.

626
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:10,107
Oh wait, this one might.

627
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:12,446
William Earling, exhibitionist.

628
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,532
He got kicked out of two retirements
home for flashing his "junk".

629
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:17,072
He lives in your building.

630
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:20,436
Yeah, Mr. Earling! He's love reading
newspaper from my hamster cage.

631
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:21,377
He's a perv.

632
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:26,266
Wow! That's bold.

633
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:29,004
Thank you. Got this one.

634
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:42,014
Well, hello there.

635
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:44,649
Hey, Mr. Earling.

636
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:46,530
I'm here cause I
worked for your bond agent,

637
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:48,107
you missed your court appeareance.

638
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:54,309
So maybe you could put on
a robe or something

639
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,862
and we go get you a new court date.

640
00:34:57,236 --> 00:35:02,333
Court date, yes. Parole, no!

641
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:08,586
I was born naked, I'm gonna die naked,
and everything in between, naked!

642
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,250
Despatch please.

643
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:12,971
Yeah, I've got an FTA here,

644
00:35:12,972 --> 00:35:15,138
am requesting aid for the
transfer of custody.

645
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:17,799
Thanks.

646
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,228
Well, I'm not too sure of
what happens now, Mr. Earling

647
00:35:22,229 --> 00:35:23,555
and I feel really bad about that.

648
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,684
Oh no, no, no, not that bad,
put it away.

649
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:30,231
What?

650
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,067
So bad! Beep... beeping at?

651
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,280
Oh crap! Crap! Come on.

652
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:38,365
- You did not steal my car.
- I was borrowing the car.

653
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:39,870
- Call the cop!
- This is my...

654
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,123
Oh, goddamn it!

655
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:43,264
This is my vehicle!

656
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:45,452
It's mine for the time, Morelli.
Suck it.

657
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,205
Oh my God, is that guy naked?

658
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:51,991
You'd better be wearing pants.
You'd better wearing pants, pal!

659
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,696
Aah, lighten up, son.
Fresh air is good for the boy!

660
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,973
Hey, we're headed
to the Police Station now,

661
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:00,412
so if you wanna follow us there,

662
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:02,370
that'll be great, it would make
my job a lot easier.

663
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,520
- Open the door!
- I got to go!

664
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:06,391
- Great to see you!
- Get out!

665
00:36:06,392 --> 00:36:07,111
See you soon!

666
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,321
Come back!

667
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,986
I think he sued his bondman,
he cut you a cheque.

668
00:36:16,148 --> 00:36:18,367
Well, I was hoping for cash.
It would really mean something.

669
00:36:18,484 --> 00:36:21,288
Hey Plum! You can't get Morelli naked
so you're settling for him?

670
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:25,541
- What's wrong with you?
- This ain't no booty prize, pally!

671
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,704
See you later, Mr. Earling.

672
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,035
Sure I had to see
an guy twig and berries,

673
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:34,250
but at least it bought me a meal
that didn't come in a lunch box.

674
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,383
Hey! You want a meatball?

675
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:39,493
No.

676
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:43,385
Look at this. William Earling.
My first FTA.

677
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,057
Nice job.

678
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,098
But you know,
it's gonna be a lot harder

679
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,307
to take down Morelli though, right?

680
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:51,900
I mean he's good cop,
probably a better felon.

681
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,318
What is with you two anyway?

682
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,429
Nothing, sold him a
conolia in high school.

683
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,746
Honey, half the women in Jersey
sold Joe Morelli's their conolia.

684
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:09,566
So I mean, you were riding
around in Morelli's car,

685
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:10,618
learning how to shoot gun,

686
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,540
chased him down like a dog,

687
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:14,966
it's a lot of cheap respect
for a nobody.

688
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:18,419
Conolia?

689
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:23,925
Yeah, I gotta bounce... duty calls.

690
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:27,060
Wait! I owed you some of this,
for the gun.

691
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:29,514
No, no. Pay me back when
you're rolling in it.

692
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:31,850
You know he's going to steal
his car back, right?

693
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,643
I won't counting on it.

694
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:47,332
- Hey!
- Hey!

695
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,774
- That's a manly car.
- I kind of deal in cars.

696
00:37:52,078 --> 00:37:52,889
She stole it.

697
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,916
Look, any words on Carmen yet?

698
00:37:56,082 --> 00:37:58,335
I'm working on it.

699
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,921
Hey listen, have you guys seen an
old sedan sneaking around here lately?

700
00:38:02,088 --> 00:38:03,315
No.

701
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,474
Would you quit giving it
away for free?

702
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,516
You just want to roll up
and start asking questions.

703
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:16,936
I heard you was a bounty hunter,
do you make a lot of money doing that?

704
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:18,901
10% of the bond.

705
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,486
Hey, we should changed our profession!

706
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:24,816
You know what, if you want
more information from Luli,

707
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:26,329
you got to bring her a snack.

708
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,034
- Done.
- Alright!

709
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:28,885
Bye girl.

710
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:30,950
- Alright, I'll see you guys soon.
- Bye-bye.

711
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,505
Lula!

712
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,127
A snack?

713
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,386
You always complaining!
It's hot, I am hungry!

714
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:50,811
<i>Here is a Jersey survival tip.</i>

715
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:54,341
<i>When you remove someone's master
fuse, they can't start their car.</i>

716
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,287
<i>Once Morelli's stick his head
under the hood,</i>

717
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,868
<i>I'm gonna take him down
with my pepper spray.</i>

718
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:10,123
<i>It's gonna be awesome.</i>

719
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:15,953
This sucks.

720
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:28,474
- Hello?
- Hey dolly, how long til you're here?

721
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,350
I can't come, gramp. I'm busy.

722
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,673
She said she is busy.

723
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,438
- Put her on the box
- <i>No gramp,</i> don't put me on speaker.

724
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,525
Everybody yelled
<i>when you put me on speaker...</i>

725
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:41,160
I'm making a nice big pot of
stuffed cabbages,

726
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:42,580
you should come home for dinner.

727
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,955
- Worked, Ma.
- You still chasing after Morelli, eh?

728
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:49,946
This time I'm waiting
for him to come to me.

729
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:53,245
She's gonna be waiting a long time.

730
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,460
<i>I'm still</i> on the phone gramp,
I can hear you.

731
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,552
Eh! of course! He send his cousin.

732
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,949
This suck.

733
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:28,897
You're so stupid.

734
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,995
I want my car and I want it now.

735
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:40,897
Goddamn it, Morelli!

736
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:44,291
Your car?
God, I thought you were Ramirez.

737
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,065
I thought you were here to kill me!
Jesus!

738
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,924
I want the keys, the master fuse,
all of it, now!

739
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:52,676
God.

740
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:54,727
Go to hell.

741
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,437
Kind of already there.

742
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:01,396
Quit looking at my tits.

743
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,323
Oh, come on!

744
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:06,154
Actually, I was looking at your hands.

745
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,482
I'm gonna lose my towel.

746
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:10,401
Wish I could stick around.

747
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:16,766
<i>I'll be honest and trust me.
I'm not proud of this but,</i>

748
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,073
<i>I fantasized about being
handcuff and naked</i>

749
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:21,238
<i>in front of Joe Morelli once.</i>

750
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:22,743
<i>Okay maybe twice.</i>

751
00:41:23,134 --> 00:41:26,245
You don't have a car,
cause you've too damn issues!

752
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:29,595
Three words: Grand Theft Auto!

753
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:32,514
Yeah? Like I said,
why don't you call the police, eh?

754
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:35,253
Who the hell care? How does
a person eat like you eat

755
00:41:35,254 --> 00:41:37,645
and look like you look.

756
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:39,892
You know what I don't get.

757
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:42,569
Why you can't just come right on
and said it, "You look great, Steph!"

758
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,317
Gee, thanks... Joe.

759
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:47,446
Cheese balls? Are you kidding me?

760
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,409
No keys in here!

761
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:57,748
You haven't seen any
master fuse around, have you?

762
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:01,752
Hey, why you messing my
tasty cakes, eh?

763
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,208
- Why did you take my vehicle?
- To draw you out,

764
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:06,458
Obviously it worked.

765
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:07,937
You're naked and shivering in a tub,

766
00:42:07,947 --> 00:42:09,919
you're not capable of drawing
me out, Plum.

767
00:42:10,085 --> 00:42:11,883
Just remember that.

768
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:16,054
You know what, keep the wheels,
I don't give a shit.

769
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:18,765
No... Joe, no!!

770
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:21,264
I am taking the towel!

771
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,648
Not as great, you can have it back.

772
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:26,998
- Damn it, Joe!
- Sorry.

773
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,318
- Leave it there for ya.
- Great... thanks.

774
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,280
- You looked pretty by the way!
- Gee... thanks, Joe!

775
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:38,100
Oh crap!

776
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:41,826
<i>If I call my mother, she will just
send my father, and well,</i>

777
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:44,374
<i>that'll be awkward</i>

778
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,711
Come here now. Come.

779
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:01,596
<i>There is only one person I know who
would have a handcuff's key.</i>

780
00:43:01,804 --> 00:43:04,307
<i>He could be here in 10 minutes.</i>

781
00:43:10,604 --> 00:43:12,481
Sorry, fellas.

782
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:14,491
Are you in danger?

783
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,036
Sort of, not exactly.

784
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:19,955
- I'm busy.
- I'm naked.

785
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,538
I'll be right there.

786
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,669
- How did he get in?
- Picked the lock.

787
00:43:25,828 --> 00:43:28,422
- How did you get in?
- Picked the lock.

788
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:33,632
- Really, that easy?
- Vulnerable more like it.

789
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,922
Look, get yourself a couple
of dead bolts.

790
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,807
Locked that shit up.

791
00:43:41,844 --> 00:43:43,221
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

792
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:49,109
<i>So that's two guys in one night,
that'd seen me naked and walk away.</i>

793
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:50,936
<i>Should I be worried?</i>

794
00:43:54,982 --> 00:43:56,780
Eddie, thanks for coming.

795
00:43:56,942 --> 00:43:59,240
- Make it quick, I only got a sec.
- Yeah.

796
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:01,750
- How's that? Hey, its my...
- Yeah...

797
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:05,538
S.O.C - Scene of the Crime.

798
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,369
Someone watching too much TV.

799
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,052
Lots of stuff going on.
Right around the Shaw.

800
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,095
This is where Carmen lives, she is
missing, she gets an X. Ziggy's dead.

801
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:15,012
He gets an X.

802
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,170
And over here - is Stark Street gym.

803
00:44:17,171 --> 00:44:18,997
Jesus Christ! You teaching me
how to be a cop?

804
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:22,235
No, cause I don't think being a cop
is all that hard, got more resources.

805
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,194
It's being a bounty hunter on
the other hand, another story.

806
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,473
Anyway, I'm noticing a pattern.

807
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:28,236
You dragged me over here...

808
00:44:28,691 --> 00:44:30,693
You know what, I've work to do.

809
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,439
Lots of X's piling up on Shaw.
Just saying.

810
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,904
Either way, no one's talking
to the cops out there.

811
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:43,530
Good thing I am not a cop.

812
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,653
<i>If Eddie wasn't going to follow
the X's, I was.</i>

813
00:44:53,415 --> 00:44:55,918
<i>It lead me right
to Carmen's apartment.</i>

814
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:58,837
<i>Scene of the Crime.</i>

815
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,897
What! You think we're
gonna steal your car?

816
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:19,033
It's not even mine.
Knocked yourself out.

817
00:45:52,224 --> 00:45:53,471
<i>Carmen.</i>

818
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:56,437
<i>Morelli's missing informant.</i>

819
00:45:56,603 --> 00:46:00,198
<i>Funny, no pictures of the boyfriend.</i>

820
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:03,369
<i>Maybe she didn't like Ramirez
that much after all.</i>

821
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:13,412
Why did you think you do
all these things, huh?

822
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,668
Stupid cunt!

823
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:18,676
<i>That's a pretty fancy truck
for this neighborhood.</i>

824
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:22,971
Hey buddy.

825
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:28,845
- Your's?
- My daughter's, I am baby-sitting.

826
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:31,468
You shouldn't be in here, <i>papito.</i>
You too,

827
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,665
me neither...
none of us should be in here.

828
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:36,205
Can I ask you some questions,
about the night Carmen's disappeared?

829
00:46:36,206 --> 00:46:37,096
I don't know anything.

830
00:46:38,145 --> 00:46:41,115
Actually I'm going after the cop,
who shot the unarmed man.

831
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:43,492
I still don't know anything.

832
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:45,903
But I know someone who does.

833
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:52,751
Talk to her.

834
00:46:55,871 --> 00:46:57,373
Nope.

835
00:46:57,706 --> 00:46:59,424
She's going after the cop!

836
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:03,970
So, around the corner,
I got a bottle of whiskey,

837
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:08,635
Bye guys, I have enough <i>kushi,</i>
I am all about to chill, eh!

838
00:47:09,509 --> 00:47:12,661
<i>Bang</i> - A gun! And I'm like...

839
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:16,103
Oh shit, and that's what I said!
What's his face...

840
00:47:17,517 --> 00:47:19,842
- Morelli?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah... the cop, right?

841
00:47:19,854 --> 00:47:23,447
Yeah... and he's standing there with
his gun and shit. And I'm like...

842
00:47:23,448 --> 00:47:26,503
Bone him with my bottle of Jack's.
Right on the cop head.

843
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,453
And then...

844
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,114
That's when the flat nose
guy came up, right!

845
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,248
No... wait, wait, what do mean,
what flat nose guy?

846
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:34,375
The flat nose guy.

847
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:36,127
Oh my God, dude!

848
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,835
Dude flew by me like
a freaking snow leopard, right!

849
00:47:39,164 --> 00:47:42,293
He couldn't wait to get out of there
when he heard the freaking sirens.

850
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,095
- That's when the cops came?
- Yeah.

851
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,606
One more question.

852
00:47:46,814 --> 00:47:48,787
The guy with the bullet hole
in his head, gun or no gun?

853
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:49,523
No gun.

854
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:51,363
- Okay, one more question.
- Okay, you already said that.

855
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:51,995
I know.

856
00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:55,347
Did you see Carmen Sanchez at
all that night, I mean at all?

857
00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:56,781
No, nothing.

858
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,072
- One more question.
- Okay...

859
00:47:59,073 --> 00:48:00,925
You gotta stop saying that please!

860
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:03,606
I gotta know... the snake...

861
00:48:03,772 --> 00:48:06,400
Carbo, wasted.

862
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:10,279
Well, woke up and it was there.
What you gonna do?

863
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,285
It's harsh, you know.

864
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:16,080
- I'm sorry, just one second.
- Okay.

865
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,071
- What's up?
- What you doing?

866
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:20,438
<i>- Making ravioli in my high heels. </i>
- What're you doing?

867
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,254
<i>Got an FTA for you,
ready to have some fun?</i>

868
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,510
- Tell her... yes!
- You can hear that?

869
00:48:25,711 --> 00:48:27,179
Ninja ears!

870
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:34,637
<i>Lonnie Dodd, expect to see another
cobs, skinny, shirtless trademark.</i>

871
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:35,654
Got it.

872
00:48:35,655 --> 00:48:38,057
I got to call in to Ranger for backup.

873
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:39,349
<i>I've got this.</i>

874
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:42,065
<i>- I know but just in case.</i>
- Okay.

875
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:43,541
Hey, hey! You're talking to Steph?

876
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:45,822
She got any lock with Morelli?
What's happening with that?

877
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:47,316
Hey, Connie!

878
00:48:47,482 --> 00:48:50,031
Connie! How come you never listened
to me? All you do is, you do that.

879
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:58,046
- Who are you?
- Stephanie Plum.

880
00:48:58,243 --> 00:49:00,416
Plum? Vincent Plum? Get out of here!

881
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,126
Oh no, no, hold on!

882
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:05,751
- Really?
- Truely.

883
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,171
In that case, come on in!

884
00:49:09,254 --> 00:49:11,677
- My gun.
- My gun?!

885
00:49:12,174 --> 00:49:13,596
Crap!

886
00:49:15,073 --> 00:49:16,093
Hey!

887
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:24,419
Come on now, Lonnie, nice and easy.

888
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,981
Alright, you know the drill.
Come out in slow mo, now.

889
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:29,016
Cause you and me,
we're gonna go inside,

890
00:49:29,017 --> 00:49:30,268
grabbed your shirt.
You're coming with me.

891
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:39,539
125 pounds of angry female
can do a lot of damage.

892
00:49:41,453 --> 00:49:43,330
Who's my bitch?

893
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:48,311
Hoo... yeah, I saw that on TV.
<i>Okay, 130 tops.</i>

894
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:50,136
Ranger, when did you get here?

895
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,786
About 30 seconds before
your hillbilly shot me.

896
00:49:52,848 --> 00:49:53,228
- What?
- Yeah.

897
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:54,746
Wait a second, is that your gun?

898
00:49:54,975 --> 00:49:57,027
<i>I totally get now why he's always
wearing kevlar.</i>

899
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,428
- Here.
- Jesus.

900
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:03,789
- Here, cuffed this guy.
- I'm so, so sorry.

901
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,902
- That's okay.
- Not you!

902
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:10,900
Got it? I've already called 911,
there's a squad car on the way.

903
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,450
Yup. And I've got to bounce.
I got a date with the bad guy.

904
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:17,156
- Good luck, Plum.
- Thank you!

905
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:18,581
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

906
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,037
He's yours.

907
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:26,207
No, I don't think you understand.
He got shot with the gun he bought me!

908
00:50:26,373 --> 00:50:29,673
You're hyperventilating.
Steph, you should relax.

909
00:50:29,835 --> 00:50:31,382
Get yourself a little snack
or something.

910
00:50:31,586 --> 00:50:33,588
A snack? That's your advice?

911
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:35,507
That's always my advice.

912
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:38,014
<i>A snack wasn't a bad idea actually.</i>

913
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:40,812
<i>And as long as I was there,
I grab one for Lula too.</i>

914
00:50:41,012 --> 00:50:44,562
- What have you brought?
- Iced Coke.

915
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:46,784
Hey, what you want?

916
00:50:47,227 --> 00:50:49,571
I'm talking to my friend here,
go around!

917
00:50:49,688 --> 00:50:51,531
Go around!

918
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,909
Now what was your questions, sweety?

919
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:55,410
Look, I don't want to get anybody
into trouble...

920
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:56,871
What kinda game you playing?

921
00:50:56,872 --> 00:50:58,636
See, the first thing come
to mind, that's all.

922
00:50:58,637 --> 00:51:00,411
Just the first thing.

923
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:02,451
A truck, orange with stripes.

924
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:03,834
Step away, Lula, don't...

925
00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:04,795
- Ramirez.
- No, no, no!

926
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,538
- Damn, I knew it!
- God...

927
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:09,792
Almighty, would you please
stop talking to this girl.

928
00:51:10,709 --> 00:51:13,132
- I think I pissed her off.
- That's just her.

929
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,082
You know we got this good cops,
bad cops things going.

930
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,089
Except we are hookers.

931
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:18,554
Stop talking!

932
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:21,932
Go away B, this ain't your hive.

933
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:25,103
- You see?
- Yeah, hold on a second.

934
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:28,819
- Hey.
- Hey...

935
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,855
You talked to a guy name
Cho this morning?

936
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:34,653
He was the first one on the
scene. The guy is a real riot, why?

937
00:51:35,442 --> 00:51:37,040
Well, he's just took a dive
from a 4 storey window.

938
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,742
<i>Heard it on the scanner.</i>

939
00:51:40,488 --> 00:51:42,115
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

940
00:51:47,078 --> 00:51:49,195
Anyway, <i>might have been an accident.</i>

941
00:51:49,196 --> 00:51:51,741
No, absolutely not.
Somebody killed him.

942
00:51:52,017 --> 00:51:55,897
<i>It also might be punishment for
talking to you because they shot Plum.</i>

943
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:59,763
<i>You've got enemies you can't see,
you need to lay low.</i>

944
00:52:00,258 --> 00:52:03,558
- Are you listening to me?
- I am, I am.

945
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:13,356
- I've got to run.
- Okay, thank you.

946
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,198
- Don't mentioned it.
- See you soon.

947
00:52:45,011 --> 00:52:46,749
<i>I've been on the job three days,
and I have already</i>

948
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,565
<i>been attacked by
a psychopathic fighter.</i>

949
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:52,431
<i>I got Ranger shot,
and now Cho was dead.</i>

950
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:55,400
<i>On top of all that, I was nowhere
close to finding Carmen</i>

951
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:56,480
<i>and bringing in Morelli.</i>

952
00:53:00,379 --> 00:53:02,596
Umm... No?

953
00:53:03,497 --> 00:53:04,514
Later then.

954
00:53:07,409 --> 00:53:09,211
<i>Bitch.</i>

955
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:25,435
Oh... Lula! Lula! Oh... Lula.

956
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,772
Oh God, I'm so sorry, I am gonna
get you help, okay?

957
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,143
Hey! Hey, somebody help me!

958
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:38,945
You've been here all day waiting
for MRI and shit. Go home.

959
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,356
You've got better thing
to do than waiting for Lula

960
00:53:41,357 --> 00:53:43,661
drastic ass to be discharged.

961
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,977
Huh, look at this fool!

962
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,860
Look, I just wanted to apologize
for one of my kickers.

963
00:53:48,861 --> 00:53:50,665
I don't like when this sort of
thing happened, you know.

964
00:53:50,952 --> 00:53:52,299
I mean the way he treats women,

965
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,470
I don't know what's the matter
with him.

966
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:54,343
I mean... I mean,

967
00:53:54,344 --> 00:53:56,921
I knew he's crazy, I just didn't
know he was psycho, that's all.

968
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:59,927
Yeah, I don't think we're the ideal
audiences to be complaining to.

969
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,974
Oh Jesus, Lula,
I'm so sorry... I mean...

970
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,088
Nobody told me.
Did he break anything?

971
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:08,395
Here, this... this are for you.
I'll pay for all the bills.

972
00:54:09,137 --> 00:54:12,641
Oh, Jimmy Alpha!
Take these stink-ass flowers!

973
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,423
- No, you gave it to me.
- She's gonna be fine.

974
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:16,707
Oh yeah.

975
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:18,821
I'm not excusing him
or nothing but just

976
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,683
take a day before you
pressed charges, alright.

977
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,913
He can't take another assault charges,
you know what I'm saying here.

978
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:24,820
You called me on these.

979
00:54:24,986 --> 00:54:28,286
If he bothers you or anything, you
call me. You call me right away, okay?

980
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,037
Ooh... sorry, I'm sorry.

981
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:32,706
- Alright, help me on up.
- Alright. Come on.

982
00:54:33,828 --> 00:54:34,832
- Let me...
- Oh, watch your arm.

983
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:35,875
- Okay!
- Okay.

984
00:54:35,914 --> 00:54:37,882
Okay, alright. Just watch yourself.

985
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:40,969
- Get some rest.
- Alright.

986
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:42,470
See you all later.

987
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:54,172
<i>This may have have started
with Morelli and the 50 grands,</i>

988
00:54:54,173 --> 00:54:56,568
<i>but it wasn't about that anymore.</i>

989
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,608
<i>Now, it's personal.</i>

990
00:55:05,985 --> 00:55:07,828
You got to put some guys on the Stark.

991
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:09,612
Ramirez just beat the hell out
of a friend of mine,

992
00:55:09,613 --> 00:55:12,079
he killed John Cho and
Rosa Gomez is next, Eddie.

993
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,476
- She's got a little kid with her...
- Woh, woh...

994
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:14,199
You've got to do something.

995
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,129
Nobody killed John Cho.

996
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:17,279
This guy a variety pot-head.

997
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,257
No noticed, so he's just hardly
a blip on the radar.

998
00:55:19,457 --> 00:55:21,703
He was smart and funny!
He saw the whole thing go down.

999
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:24,179
He talked to me, Eddie.
And he's dead!

1000
00:55:24,337 --> 00:55:25,022
Calm down.

1001
00:55:25,023 --> 00:55:27,762
How're you not seeing these?
Rosa Gomez is next!

1002
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:31,474
Mark my words... they talk, they died!
Do something!

1003
00:55:58,597 --> 00:56:02,668
<i>If he's coming after me,
I am looking for a fight.</i>

1004
00:56:31,446 --> 00:56:33,790
It's okay, Steph.

1005
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,921
I...

1006
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,007
I need your help.

1007
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,010
You look like you could eat something.

1008
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,722
Come on.

1009
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:01,184
Sorry, bro.

1010
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,595
Wow! Nicely done.

1011
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,760
Thank you.

1012
00:57:31,005 --> 00:57:32,928
I saw you hang in there.

1013
00:57:33,174 --> 00:57:35,927
And... I'll be candid.

1014
00:57:36,261 --> 00:57:38,889
- Your hamster eats better than you.
- Not tonight, he doesn't.

1015
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:40,818
Not tonight.

1016
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:46,397
- You've got a nine millimeter Glock?
- Yeah, service pistol.

1017
00:57:46,646 --> 00:57:48,523
You still got it?

1018
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,317
I am still a cop.

1019
00:57:50,483 --> 00:57:51,951
Can't take it away if they
can't find me.

1020
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,703
It's just a matter of time.
You know that, right?

1021
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:55,328
The villagers are lighting
their torches.

1022
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,619
It doesn't hurt that you're
dead or alive proposition.

1023
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:02,461
Phew! Wow, there it is, eh?

1024
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:05,548
There is no evidence that anyone
was shooting at you.

1025
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:08,256
No bullets in the walls,
the doors jammed.

1026
00:58:08,293 --> 00:58:09,987
No powder on Ziggy's hands, no gun!

1027
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:12,063
No one left alive,
just dead one way or another.

1028
00:58:12,162 --> 00:58:14,265
- What do you expect?
- I don't expect anything!

1029
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,894
What I want is to find Ziggy's gun,
to prove it misfired.

1030
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,471
It's kinda hard with the pile of casts

1031
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:21,223
I'm about to tell you.
You know what I am saying.

1032
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:23,979
Look!

1033
00:58:24,183 --> 00:58:26,185
I'm going to go out on a limb
here and say that,

1034
00:58:26,394 --> 00:58:30,069
you don't want to share the reward
or the credit with anybody else.

1035
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,659
I can help you with that.

1036
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,698
I'm listening.

1037
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:38,202
The only person with ties to both
Carmen and Ziggy is Ramirez, right.

1038
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:39,345
Everyone else is dead.

1039
00:58:39,714 --> 00:58:41,826
Well, there was one other guy, but...

1040
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:44,246
He didn't happen to have
a flat nose, did he?

1041
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,878
Shit... Plum, nice.

1042
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:52,637
- We got to draw Ramirez out.
- Ooh, that's a big we.

1043
00:58:54,172 --> 00:58:56,531
I'm not going to be bait so you
can moved out of your van, Joe.

1044
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:59,619
No offense, but you can't bring him in
without my co-operation.

1045
00:58:59,629 --> 00:59:03,439
I'm bigger, stronger
and a lot meaner than you.

1046
00:59:03,723 --> 00:59:08,274
Plus, you know... I'd rather be
shot than go in before I'm ready.

1047
00:59:08,436 --> 00:59:12,486
So, you need my help with this, Plum.

1048
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:15,242
Believe it.

1049
00:59:18,446 --> 00:59:20,995
$50,000 changes my world.

1050
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:28,752
Alright, I'm in!

1051
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:36,218
But, I think we both know
that the money is secondary.

1052
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:39,183
Keep flappering your lips.
I'm in it for the cash.

1053
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:42,227
Oh, that's a lie!

1054
00:59:47,308 --> 00:59:49,310
It's a lie.

1055
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:53,823
See a little vein in your neck,
it's pulsing.

1056
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,068
You want to be the one.

1057
00:59:56,072 --> 00:59:58,706
Its okay, you got it made.

1058
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:04,209
Ancient history.

1059
01:00:05,576 --> 01:00:08,125
Like the pyramids, baby.

1060
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:33,445
You look like hell, by the way.

1061
01:00:33,646 --> 01:00:36,741
I've been waiting a long time
to say that. I mean it.

1062
01:00:38,276 --> 01:00:40,529
Wanna say that again?

1063
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,788
No.

1064
01:00:52,457 --> 01:00:55,677
You'll have to take a bath,
I don't have a shower curtain.

1065
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,846
You can stay here if you want.

1066
01:01:02,341 --> 01:01:05,515
No one has been this nice to me
in a long, long time.

1067
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,143
I know.

1068
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,614
Okay.

1069
01:01:20,818 --> 01:01:23,697
- Good night.
- Good night.

1070
01:02:01,876 --> 01:02:05,576
Yo! Rise and shine, bad ass!

1071
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:15,711
- Did you sleep?
- Yeah, like a rock.

1072
01:02:15,748 --> 01:02:17,466
Yeah, me too.

1073
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:20,996
Stand up. Lift your shirt.

1074
01:02:21,462 --> 01:02:24,511
Wow, not even a please, huh?

1075
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,552
Actually, just take it off.

1076
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,388
Please.

1077
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:34,734
- Come on, strictly professional!
- Yeah...

1078
01:02:35,476 --> 01:02:39,447
Look, it's a wire, okay!
It's our best option.

1079
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:50,203
Pretty round.

1080
01:02:50,575 --> 01:02:52,293
Thank you.

1081
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,047
Best option for what?

1082
01:02:57,222 --> 01:02:59,659
Best option, in case someone
start talking to you.

1083
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,463
Have it on tape, because...

1084
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:09,011
You know, for whatever reason people
talked to you, you've got it wired.

1085
01:03:10,928 --> 01:03:12,805
Stand still, will you!

1086
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:16,662
I highly doubt anybody
gonna comes out and

1087
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:18,726
incriminated themselves to me on tape.

1088
01:03:19,067 --> 01:03:21,906
I adjust the mike to record you.

1089
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:23,570
Excuse me.

1090
01:03:24,483 --> 01:03:26,326
So I can hear you.

1091
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:30,252
So I know you are safe.

1092
01:03:36,663 --> 01:03:37,431
That's it.

1093
01:03:39,957 --> 01:03:43,006
- Who knows I am here?
- No one. I swear to God.

1094
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,182
Whoever he is, get rid of him.

1095
01:03:55,014 --> 01:03:58,359
Hello, I am Morty Beyers.

1096
01:03:58,643 --> 01:04:00,816
Can I come in for a second?

1097
01:04:01,562 --> 01:04:03,690
Actually, I was... uhm...

1098
01:04:04,565 --> 01:04:06,702
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1099
01:04:06,703 --> 01:04:07,482
Uh-huh!

1100
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,492
- Am I intruding?
- No.

1101
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:14,371
- God... no!
- Well, I... I need my files back.

1102
01:04:15,576 --> 01:04:19,046
When Morelli skipped, it was mine.
That's my pay day.

1103
01:04:19,205 --> 01:04:20,798
But they gave it to me, so...

1104
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:24,302
Yeah, because I was sick,
but now I'm better.

1105
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:26,887
A tiny little scar. No stitches.

1106
01:04:27,088 --> 01:04:28,556
Laparoscopic.

1107
01:04:28,756 --> 01:04:31,350
Take a cam,
burrow right down in there...

1108
01:04:31,759 --> 01:04:34,421
- It's quite something.
- It's great.

1109
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:37,519
So here is the deal.
I'm taking Morelli.

1110
01:04:37,556 --> 01:04:39,945
Vinnie is not going to care which
one of us brings him in.

1111
01:04:40,101 --> 01:04:42,649
But I care, and I can't
help but noticed

1112
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,073
that his Explorer is
parked down there.

1113
01:04:45,439 --> 01:04:47,567
I'm just trying to draw him out.

1114
01:04:48,109 --> 01:04:52,330
That's smart, very smart.
How's that working for you?

1115
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:54,615
Nothing yet, but...

1116
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:56,048
Got eyes on him?

1117
01:04:56,049 --> 01:04:58,415
A couple of times. Found him on Stark.

1118
01:04:58,786 --> 01:05:04,259
I am asking you nice.
I need you to step away.

1119
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,024
- Yeah, I can't do that.
- That's funny.

1120
01:05:06,025 --> 01:05:08,663
Because last I heard you were selling
underpants at Macy's.

1121
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:13,472
You're not really exactly qualified,
are you?

1122
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:15,811
Well, then you should have
nothing to worry about, right.

1123
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:19,056
- Okay, I was just leaving anyway.
- Alright... thanks for stopping in.

1124
01:05:19,057 --> 01:05:20,580
Sure.

1125
01:05:21,142 --> 01:05:24,041
And, no hard feeling when I...
when I bring him in.

1126
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,472
Naw, no hard feelings.

1127
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:30,521
That's good cause you
never had a shot anyway.

1128
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:31,531
Nice!

1129
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:33,326
That was weird.

1130
01:05:33,327 --> 01:05:35,532
Check your purse.
Think he took your keys.

1131
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,618
Oh... damn it! He did!

1132
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,508
God's gonna get you for
this you, Morty Beyers!

1133
01:05:44,509 --> 01:05:46,630
Screwed God!

1134
01:05:55,843 --> 01:05:57,720
<i>Well, I told them.</i>

1135
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,733
They blew up our car!

1136
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:06,229
- Excuse me, whose car?
- Your car.

1137
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,068
You want it back?

1138
01:06:09,857 --> 01:06:11,700
Oh... Morty.

1139
01:06:12,026 --> 01:06:13,534
<i>Obviously I realize that the
chances of these being</i>

1140
01:06:13,535 --> 01:06:15,155
<i>an accident is of course slim.</i>

1141
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:18,913
<i>And that the chances of it being
meant for me were large.</i>

1142
01:06:19,283 --> 01:06:21,687
Okay, so you think Morty Beyers
is roasted in Morelli's car,

1143
01:06:21,688 --> 01:06:23,629
because he pissed of God.

1144
01:06:23,788 --> 01:06:25,404
Just a theory, one of many.

1145
01:06:26,006 --> 01:06:28,154
Kidding aside,
you do realised Morty Beyers

1146
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:30,261
was not the intended here.

1147
01:06:30,711 --> 01:06:32,713
You've given it any thought?

1148
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:35,030
Building on the corner
of Shaw's mining,

1149
01:06:35,031 --> 01:06:36,805
up in flames. Four alarms.

1150
01:06:36,967 --> 01:06:39,311
- It's Rosa Gomez.
- Let's go.

1151
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:42,314
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay.

1152
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:46,986
- No Madam, you're not going in.
- Eddie!

1153
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,194
- Let her through...
- Alright, go on.

1154
01:06:51,357 --> 01:06:54,531
<i>I was in a panic on the drive over
until Eddie's called to tell me,</i>

1155
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,798
<i>he moved Rosa and Carmen's kids
out the night before.</i>

1156
01:06:57,964 --> 01:06:59,482
<i>They were saved.</i>

1157
01:07:06,664 --> 01:07:09,543
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you, Plum?

1158
01:07:10,209 --> 01:07:12,678
Carmen's building.
It's a real mess up here.

1159
01:07:12,878 --> 01:07:15,097
Lot of cops around,
anyone you want me to say 'hi' to?

1160
01:07:15,256 --> 01:07:16,495
Who you talking to?

1161
01:07:16,496 --> 01:07:19,386
My Grandma. She loves
a good bonding. What're you gonna do?

1162
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,265
- Okay, one mile tops.
- What're you talking about?

1163
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:26,765
<i>Your transmitter.</i> If I can't hear you,
I can't help you.

1164
01:07:26,766 --> 01:07:28,336
We got to stay
within a mile of each other.

1165
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:30,537
Now I've gotta burn this phone
after I made this call,

1166
01:07:30,538 --> 01:07:31,530
and I can't get a new one.

1167
01:07:31,689 --> 01:07:33,987
So you got to keep letting me
know where you are.

1168
01:07:34,024 --> 01:07:36,128
Well... if you gotta know, I'm headed
over to the Bernie Kuntz's

1169
01:07:36,129 --> 01:07:38,076
home hardwares,
and pick up a new shower curtain

1170
01:07:38,077 --> 01:07:40,623
cause some asshole went
and ruined mine.

1171
01:07:40,781 --> 01:07:42,374
Okay, okay... that's close.

1172
01:07:42,575 --> 01:07:45,419
Meet me over in Stark, when you're
done playing house with Bernie's.

1173
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:48,672
Oh boy... I can't wait.

1174
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,293
Okay, nice talking to you too.

1175
01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:59,725
- Molotov cocktail into the apartment.
- Oh God.

1176
01:07:59,884 --> 01:08:01,401
I want you to know.

1177
01:08:01,427 --> 01:08:04,556
You saved two people
by being screaming lunatic.

1178
01:08:04,763 --> 01:08:07,937
Thanks Eddie. I told you, eh?

1179
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,774
I am always right.
You should know this by now.

1180
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:16,237
So, let's see here.

1181
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,335
It's a nice array of
shower curtains there, huh?

1182
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,287
Yeah, you've got quite a selection.

1183
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,259
Most women gravitate
toward the florals but I'm

1184
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:32,921
thinking you're
more checkerboard of sort's.

1185
01:08:34,018 --> 01:08:35,895
Heh... this guy kills me.

1186
01:08:36,003 --> 01:08:37,038
It's nice to see you Bernie,
how you doing?

1187
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,050
Quite good, you too.
I got... sliding doors.

1188
01:08:41,258 --> 01:08:43,511
Yeah, chicks loves sliding doors,
Bernie.

1189
01:08:43,677 --> 01:08:46,198
Guest bath imbued is real nice.

1190
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,609
Oh yes, Sal's getting a fresh catch.

1191
01:08:50,976 --> 01:08:54,355
Hey, you should go over there and
get yourself a nice piece of fish.

1192
01:08:54,772 --> 01:08:57,116
A friend of Ziggy,
<i>if you remember me saying.</i>

1193
01:08:57,942 --> 01:09:00,216
Yeah, yeah... I do remember.

1194
01:09:01,695 --> 01:09:03,894
- So, what is it gonna be...
<i>- This was the flat nose guy.</i>

1195
01:09:03,895 --> 01:09:04,931
Holy crap!

1196
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:07,664
<i>The only witness that could
prove Ziggy had a gun and</i>

1197
01:09:07,665 --> 01:09:09,420
<i>Morelli was no murderer.</i>

1198
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:12,719
- Huh?
- You...

1199
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:15,357
Oh, oh... um...
I'm going with the flowers.

1200
01:09:15,358 --> 01:09:15,843
Okay.

1201
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,253
- I'll bring it up if you want or...
- Oh yeah...

1202
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:20,231
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

1203
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,687
Good, yeah! Come on back,
come on back.

1204
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,936
I'm sweating.

1205
01:09:26,854 --> 01:09:29,833
Morelli, I think I found your
missing witness.

1206
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:30,984
<i>He's at Sal's butcher shop.</i>

1207
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,322
Hey, it's a cop.

1208
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:43,090
Cool it, Steph.

1209
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:47,876
Playing it cool is not my strong suite
but I cannot blow this.

1210
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:56,684
- Those flounders just in.
- Good to know. Good to know.

1211
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:59,079
So you must be Sal.

1212
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:02,870
Sal's on Hancock. That's where we are.
- That's me.

1213
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,188
Alright, I've got it... Plum.
Don't make it obvious.

1214
01:10:05,309 --> 01:10:07,812
- You're a big cook?
- Huge.

1215
01:10:07,978 --> 01:10:09,901
- Liar.
- Right.

1216
01:10:10,064 --> 01:10:12,112
I got to deliver.
You want it in the locker?

1217
01:10:12,316 --> 01:10:15,160
Yeah, yeah! But go through
the back, would you?

1218
01:10:20,407 --> 01:10:22,671
<i>Christ, amaze at this guy.</i>

1219
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,545
Where were we?

1220
01:10:24,745 --> 01:10:27,373
Cod is better than haddock,
not as good as the sea bass.

1221
01:10:27,915 --> 01:10:29,562
- Who's that?
- Who is who?

1222
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:32,803
That guy that just walked by,
you know... with the <i>flat nose?</i>

1223
01:10:33,003 --> 01:10:35,522
Louis or something, he worked
for a distributor in Philly.

1224
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:36,982
Hang on a second.

1225
01:10:37,341 --> 01:10:40,887
Hey! When you're finish, there's
two barrels back there by the door.

1226
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:43,726
One's heavy, so used dolly,
roll it, whatever it takes,

1227
01:10:43,727 --> 01:10:44,859
just get it out of here, alright?

1228
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:48,648
What's he taking?
What's in the barrels?

1229
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:50,037
Who's asking?

1230
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:54,727
Arr.. you know, I'm gonna just go with
that flounder, it looks pretty good.

1231
01:10:55,943 --> 01:10:58,742
Morelli, why don't you listen to me?

1232
01:11:02,116 --> 01:11:05,416
Where are you? You'd better get to
that crappy van in gear

1233
01:11:05,578 --> 01:11:09,082
because this flat-nose guy is loading
barrels onto the truck <i>as we speak.</i>

1234
01:11:09,456 --> 01:11:10,878
<i>- Get here!</i>
- Okay.

1235
01:11:19,717 --> 01:11:22,311
Hey, he's closing up the shop.

1236
01:11:24,096 --> 01:11:26,190
Let's go. Move it.

1237
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,818
Oh, he's getting into the truck
with flat-nose.

1238
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,759
<i>You getting any of this, Joe... huh?</i>

1239
01:11:31,822 --> 01:11:34,920
I'm going to follow them.
I hope you're with me.

1240
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:53,258
We are heading west on junction 70.

1241
01:11:53,672 --> 01:11:54,472
Hey!

1242
01:11:55,036 --> 01:11:56,009
Move!

1243
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:14,105
<i>We're getting off at exit four.
Joe, you better be following me.</i>

1244
01:12:14,271 --> 01:12:16,194
I'm losing you, Steph.

1245
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,614
Damn.

1246
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:30,588
I found them. They parked their truck
at the Pachetko Marina.

1247
01:12:31,622 --> 01:12:33,374
I don't see anybody though.

1248
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:37,386
Jesus... Morelli, why couldn't
you've pick up another phone?

1249
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,896
- Should have waited!
- Jesus, Morelli!

1250
01:13:37,062 --> 01:13:38,325
God.

1251
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:44,446
- It's a drop. Nobody's in it.
- Yup.

1252
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:54,964
See that? Heroin.

1253
01:13:55,372 --> 01:13:58,672
So Sal's boat was moving heroin?

1254
01:14:00,336 --> 01:14:03,931
No, Sal's boat was moving ice
and sugar, what do you think?!

1255
01:14:03,964 --> 01:14:05,693
God, you don't have
to be an asshole about it!

1256
01:14:05,694 --> 01:14:06,509
Well, don't be stupid!

1257
01:14:06,626 --> 01:14:09,849
I'm not being stupid! I haven't seen
heroin before. Clearly you have.

1258
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,591
I said that! It's heroin.

1259
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:15,193
It's the truck!

1260
01:14:22,316 --> 01:14:24,284
Let's go.

1261
01:14:28,822 --> 01:14:31,211
These are the barrels that holed up
at the butcher shop.

1262
01:14:41,669 --> 01:14:42,942
Oh God!

1263
01:14:43,419 --> 01:14:44,639
Oh God!

1264
01:14:50,594 --> 01:14:52,847
Don't puke,
you'll wrecked the crime scene.

1265
01:14:55,173 --> 01:14:56,747
Hey! Let's call the police.

1266
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:59,213
No, not yet.

1267
01:14:59,223 --> 01:15:00,908
Damn it, Morelli, we had a deal!

1268
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:02,725
You were going to let
me bring you into custody,

1269
01:15:02,726 --> 01:15:03,566
once we found the missing witness!

1270
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,261
No... well, in case you didn't notice

1271
01:15:05,262 --> 01:15:07,858
my mission witness is dead,
and I'm pretty sure Carmen is too.

1272
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,777
So unless you find
Ziggy's gun somewhere,

1273
01:15:12,204 --> 01:15:13,522
I'm fresh out of luck.

1274
01:15:13,532 --> 01:15:15,063
Now, give me some light please.

1275
01:15:18,257 --> 01:15:18,927
Oh!!!

1276
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:22,183
Oh my...

1277
01:15:28,749 --> 01:15:30,367
- Carmen?
- Yeah.

1278
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,179
Her body was in Sal's this whole time.

1279
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:36,439
Listen! They tried to hide the body
when they got shot.

1280
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,142
Okay, that's it.

1281
01:15:38,508 --> 01:15:39,381
I am calling the police.

1282
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:42,079
Jesus... Stephanie, come on.
I am the police!

1283
01:15:42,534 --> 01:15:43,434
- Arrr!
- Jesus.

1284
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,658
- Is that Ramirez?
- Yeah.

1285
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,537
That just great.

1286
01:15:53,141 --> 01:15:53,941
Wow...

1287
01:15:54,273 --> 01:15:55,371
Oh...

1288
01:15:57,535 --> 01:16:00,880
Oh, I got a gun! I forgot I got a gun!

1289
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:02,450
Lipstick, Keys...

1290
01:16:02,452 --> 01:16:04,614
- Stephanie, do something!
- Huh!

1291
01:16:05,118 --> 01:16:07,337
Oh my God! I know it's here!

1292
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,018
Oh... I found it!

1293
01:16:09,422 --> 01:16:10,685
Arrr...

1294
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,501
- Can you move over?
- Shoot him.

1295
01:16:12,502 --> 01:16:14,219
No, you're swinging him away!

1296
01:16:14,386 --> 01:16:16,730
I can't get a clear shot!
I'm not comfortable with this!!

1297
01:16:16,888 --> 01:16:18,957
- You're not comfortable?!!
- I don't like this. You know what?

1298
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:21,106
- I got something better!
- Something better for who?

1299
01:16:21,107 --> 01:16:21,905
I'll find it.

1300
01:16:21,906 --> 01:16:24,601
- Stephanie! Argh...
- I got it! Hold on!

1301
01:16:25,972 --> 01:16:28,036
Hold him tight, Morelli!

1302
01:16:28,139 --> 01:16:29,059
Arrr!!

1303
01:16:38,418 --> 01:16:39,691
You alright?

1304
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:40,757
Woo...

1305
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,035
Pepper spray, eh? That was nice.

1306
01:16:46,193 --> 01:16:48,721
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

1307
01:16:50,714 --> 01:16:54,785
Okay. I got this, you find the guns.

1308
01:16:54,788 --> 01:16:57,312
Guns. Okay.

1309
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:11,260
Oh...

1310
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,323
Jimmy!

1311
01:17:12,325 --> 01:17:15,643
Mr. Alpha. Thank God you're here!
Your guy Ramirez...

1312
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:18,770
Morelli and I come down here
and we just heard a couple of shots

1313
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:21,471
and I'm pretty sure he
killed these two people.

1314
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:25,157
We just got here and found him.

1315
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,365
Alright Bopeep, yeah. I want you

1316
01:17:34,366 --> 01:17:37,149
to go cuffed officer Romeo's
over there. Come on. To the rail.

1317
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,758
Come on! Now!

1318
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,419
Come on, hurry up! What're you doing!

1319
01:17:49,823 --> 01:17:53,043
And move away.
Good, good, good, good.

1320
01:17:53,493 --> 01:17:56,588
Alright, this guy walks into a gym
and it's Ziggy Kuleska.

1321
01:17:56,788 --> 01:17:58,670
And he said to me, he says...

1322
01:17:58,671 --> 01:18:00,583
"Hey, you can make a tons of
money moving heroin!"

1323
01:18:00,584 --> 01:18:03,203
And I'm thinking,
"Absolutely not, man!"

1324
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,435
You don't know me from Adam,
but I'm a decent guy,

1325
01:18:05,436 --> 01:18:06,965
you know, I'm always trying
to do the right thing.

1326
01:18:06,966 --> 01:18:09,393
But I got to do what I got
to do to hang in there. So...

1327
01:18:09,593 --> 01:18:10,545
Now I'm in charge of money.

1328
01:18:10,611 --> 01:18:13,435
Ziggy's in charge of the dope,
we gave Ramirez to enforce.

1329
01:18:13,972 --> 01:18:15,743
And all of a sudden we
get wind that Carmen is

1330
01:18:15,744 --> 01:18:17,476
talking to the cop,
that dirty ratting whore!

1331
01:18:17,643 --> 01:18:18,986
She knew better!

1332
01:18:19,144 --> 01:18:20,731
And I know she
called you for help that night.

1333
01:18:20,732 --> 01:18:22,318
Well, you should have stay at home.

1334
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:25,701
Cause she was already dead when
you got there. You know that, right?

1335
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:29,781
So I'm going to tell you two
how this is going to go down, okay.

1336
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:32,601
See... my boy Ramirez here is going
to come to. Come on, Ramirez.

1337
01:18:32,602 --> 01:18:33,478
Come on, get up!

1338
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:36,091
He's going to rough you
guys up a little.

1339
01:18:36,092 --> 01:18:37,647
Right, he's going to
rough you up alot.

1340
01:18:37,648 --> 01:18:39,165
Then I'm going to
finish everybody off.

1341
01:18:39,331 --> 01:18:42,961
Lots of prints, lots of guns,
and we're gonna pinned it on him.

1342
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:46,968
And the great thing about it is,  I'm
gonna walked out a hero. You got that?

1343
01:18:48,382 --> 01:18:49,975
What? What's the matter with you?

1344
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:52,560
You are not feeling so good no
more, beautiful, eh?

1345
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:53,854
What... You want to use the cam, eh?

1346
01:18:54,241 --> 01:18:55,061
Ugh!

1347
01:19:01,179 --> 01:19:01,999
Argh!!!

1348
01:19:14,157 --> 01:19:16,034
You... okay?

1349
01:19:26,707 --> 01:19:27,827
Ah...

1350
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:30,767
Jesus... Steph, you've been hit!

1351
01:19:31,591 --> 01:19:33,255
Thanks... Einstein.

1352
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:35,821
You know...

1353
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,650
It's too bad. You know, cause...
it's a pretty nice ass.

1354
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:43,817
Morelli, you've got to come up with
some better material.

1355
01:19:44,271 --> 01:19:46,615
Don't think that you're gonna
to make it, cupcake.

1356
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:49,769
Come over here and help me
out with this, will ya?

1357
01:19:51,728 --> 01:19:54,265
Steph? What?

1358
01:19:55,449 --> 01:19:57,292
Cuffs?

1359
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:00,762
Steph?

1360
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,483
Stephanie?

1361
01:20:05,959 --> 01:20:08,788
Plum? Don't you even think about it!

1362
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:11,632
Steph! No! No, no, no!

1363
01:20:16,253 --> 01:20:18,881
Open the door! Open it!

1364
01:20:19,806 --> 01:20:22,730
Open the door, I am telling you!

1365
01:20:22,976 --> 01:20:25,149
Open the door!

1366
01:20:25,562 --> 01:20:27,860
Ah... you'd it coming, cupcake!

1367
01:20:29,107 --> 01:20:30,924
<i>I have to leave Alpha because
I didn't have</i>

1368
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:32,702
<i>the stomach to drive him
in the cab with me.</i>

1369
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:35,535
<i>And there was no way, I would open
that truck's door again.</i>

1370
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:38,371
<i>I figure if Ramirez woke up,
Joe would have the upper hand.</i>

1371
01:20:38,575 --> 01:20:41,295
<i>Plus, it might be good for
him to channel all that rage,</i>

1372
01:20:41,296 --> 01:20:43,971
- Despatch, please.
<i>- into someone other than me.</i>

1373
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:44,682
<i>- Despatch!</i>
- Yeah.

1374
01:20:44,684 --> 01:20:49,136
I've got two dead bodies, a hit man,
an FTA, and a bullet in my ass.

1375
01:20:49,294 --> 01:20:51,388
I'm requesting neighbourhood transfer.

1376
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,164
I got Joe Morelli.

1377
01:21:02,307 --> 01:21:07,359
<i>Fortunately, Alpha bullet only tore
into some unnecessary butt fat. </i>

1378
01:21:08,021 --> 01:21:12,572
<i>So, I can enjoy my victory laugh
without too much pain.</i>

1379
01:21:15,654 --> 01:21:18,783
- Meat truck?
- Yeah, bad luck with cars.

1380
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:22,858
There you go.
Joe Morelli, armed and pissed!

1381
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:24,188
Go ahead!

1382
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:29,477
You and your goddamn freak show!

1383
01:21:29,478 --> 01:21:32,405
What's wrong with you eh?
Jesus Christ!

1384
01:21:32,406 --> 01:21:34,765
Why did you go locked me
in a truck full of dead bodies for?

1385
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,020
Fifty thousand dollars!

1386
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:39,963
Told you a million times! And, you
handcuffed me to my shower rod!

1387
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:42,175
- Naked!
- Ha ha ... ha ha...

1388
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:45,313
Pay back sucks, suck up Morelli.

1389
01:21:46,184 --> 01:21:47,075
It's not over.

1390
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:48,695
- No?
- Not yet!

1391
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,651
Can't wait to see what you got.

1392
01:21:50,814 --> 01:21:51,701
Enjoy your perk-off!

1393
01:21:51,702 --> 01:21:53,400
- Soon, baby.
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

1394
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,579
For what it's worth... the wire.

1395
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:01,500
Jimmy Alpha confessed.
Morelli is clean.

1396
01:22:01,658 --> 01:22:03,661
Keep him on ice for awhile, will you.
Let him cool his boots.

1397
01:22:03,727 --> 01:22:05,900
Jesus! He's so mad.

1398
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:17,744
- I could have taken a cab.
- Now, baby... come on.

1399
01:22:17,745 --> 01:22:20,431
You got shot. Union said I got
to send you right home.

1400
01:22:22,721 --> 01:22:25,019
Oh yeah, I'm starving...

1401
01:22:25,181 --> 01:22:28,355
You know, the hospital gave me oatmeal
and juice. Can you believe that?

1402
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:32,064
Five clean shots to
Jimmy Alpha's heart.

1403
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:35,488
Five... it's not easy to do,
I'm impressed.

1404
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,153
Medical examiner send
his regards by the way.

1405
01:22:38,612 --> 01:22:39,385
And Ramirez?

1406
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:42,367
He spilled his guts.
He'll be a big hit in prison.

1407
01:22:43,366 --> 01:22:46,415
- What about Morelli?
- He's out and about.

1408
01:22:46,578 --> 01:22:48,672
Ziggy's gun was found under
Carmen's body.

1409
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,844
Ziggy's prints was frozen on it.
Proved he was armed

1410
01:22:50,845 --> 01:22:52,630
when Morelli shot him.
So, it was a clean kill.

1411
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:56,884
- He would be coming after me next.
- Oh...

1412
01:22:57,047 --> 01:22:59,675
- Bitch! Getting shot is a bitch!
- Yeah.

1413
01:22:59,966 --> 01:23:01,593
Getting stab is worse.

1414
01:23:03,428 --> 01:23:04,725
I'm just saying.

1415
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,063
Pretty good for someone
who's just got shot.

1416
01:23:10,226 --> 01:23:12,979
- Alright, here we go.
- Thank you.

1417
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:16,176
For someone who's just got shot,
what is that?

1418
01:23:16,177 --> 01:23:18,239
She looks good, end of story.

1419
01:23:18,443 --> 01:23:20,919
You don't add-on for someone
who's just got shot.

1420
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:21,771
It wrecks the compliment.

1421
01:23:21,772 --> 01:23:22,699
Real bad.

1422
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:25,625
Yeah, somebody need to teach
Mr. Bond with some manners!

1423
01:23:25,742 --> 01:23:27,710
I guess the interview went well?

1424
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:28,961
Oh... yeah girl.

1425
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,543
Mr. Plum need some assistant.

1426
01:23:31,665 --> 01:23:33,542
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1427
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:36,211
- Don't spend it all in place.
- Yeah, whatever you say... Vinnie.

1428
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:37,800
- Hey, Steph!
- Yup?

1429
01:23:37,963 --> 01:23:39,840
I'd hear Morelli is looking for you.

1430
01:23:42,509 --> 01:23:44,853
Yeah? I heard he was out.

1431
01:23:45,095 --> 01:23:48,065
That's good, that's a good thing.

1432
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,854
This is gonna be interesting, eh?

1433
01:23:56,515 --> 01:23:59,372
Hey! Get back to work.
Hey... get back to work. Both of you!

1434
01:23:59,373 --> 01:24:01,527
Go! Go... come on!

1435
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,952
Jesus... I got two of them.

1436
01:24:22,549 --> 01:24:24,426
Plum.

1437
01:24:24,884 --> 01:24:26,761
Morelli.

1438
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:28,680
I...

1439
01:24:28,888 --> 01:24:31,516
I saw this... and thought of you.

1440
01:24:37,147 --> 01:24:41,368
<i>Okay, if he can let go of a grudge,
so can I.</i>

1441
01:24:42,652 --> 01:24:44,950
<i>Plus, I'm not going to say no
to a cupcake.</i>
