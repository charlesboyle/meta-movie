00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:26,217
Territory of Nebraska

2
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,073
Come on girls!

3
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:57,457
Hello, Bob.

4
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,031
Afternoon, Miss Cuddy.

5
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,440
C'mon inside. I got supper ready.

6
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:23,182
The pie is made out of peaches...

7
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:24,709
from a can!

8
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,471
They had four of those cans.

9
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,598
I don't know who got the other three.
I don't know who could afford em!

10
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,213
It's good pie.

11
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,967
If it pleases you, we might
have a postprandial recital.

12
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:39,084
Say what?

13
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,479
A bit of music.

14
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,747
I like music.

15
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:53,202
# On the distant Prairie where...#

16
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,652
# they had a while #

17
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,995
# In its quiet beauty lives and smiles #

18
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:05,441
# Stands a little cottage and a creeping whine #

19
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:10,650
# Loves around his porch to twine #

20
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:16,649
# In that peaceful dwelling was a lovely child #

21
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,129
# With her blue eyes beaming soft and mild #

22
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,202
# And the weaving wing lets of her flaxen hair #

23
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,813
# Floating in the summer air #

24
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:38,662
# Fair as a lily, joyous and free #

25
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:44,286
# light of that prairie, home was she #

26
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,017
# Everyone who knew her felt the gentle prowl #

27
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,513
# Rosalie "The Prairie" round #

28
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,614
That sure was pretty singing, Miss Cuddy.

29
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,403
I got some cheese.

30
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:12,709
Cheese?

31
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,973
Yes ma'am. You know I've a few sheep out.

32
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,459
I know.

33
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,208
I made some cheese outta their milk.

34
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,384
Wonder if you'd like to have some?

35
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,951
I got some here in my pocket.

36
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:30,921
Cheese would be a fine finish to our
fried chicken dinner and peach pie...

37
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,859
this evening.

38
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,843
Well then,

39
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,290
here it is.

40
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,258
This is fine cheese,Bob.

41
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:01,945
So why not marry?

42
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:05,961
Do what?

43
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,100
Why not throw in together.

44
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,976
Lands, animals and women's lives...

45
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,883
The whole bowl of wax!

46
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:17,831
We could use my capital and know
how to improve your claimant mine.

47
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,809
And if the union produces children,
then so much the better.

48
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,929
Look that from any angle,

49
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:27,821
it works.

50
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,190
So why not marry?

51
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,239
I reckon, I go back East to find me a wife.

52
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,640
Please, Mr.Giffen.

53
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,418
I won't take no for an answer.

54
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,384
Miss Cuddy...

55
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,475
I appreciate the offer and supper...

56
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,405
and concert and all...

57
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,925
But I cannot marry you.

58
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,305
Will not.

59
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,031
Won't.

60
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,183
I ain't perfect...

61
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,034
But you are too bossy...

62
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,558
and plum damn plain.

63
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:35,411
Ain't no medicine for it.

64
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,495
This one's here is breathing a little bit momma.

65
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:00,729
Mother is dead!

66
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,691
She is dead.

67
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,225
I'll take care of it.

68
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,223
No! We must bury her properly!

69
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:08,968
I'll prepare.

70
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,835
She will smell soon.

71
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:11,917
No!

72
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,412
You wanted her to die!

73
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,093
You hated her.

74
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,025
You hate me.

75
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:25,665
I hate you!

76
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,061
You can't leave mom outside!
You can't leave mom outside!

77
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:35,292
Stop!

78
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,561
You can't leave mom outside!

79
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:46,917
The freezing...

80
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,375
Cold...

81
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,500
Father!

82
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,487
Oh My Jesus!

83
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,976
Do what do I owe this pleasure, Reverend?

84
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,377
Springtime Miss Cuddy!

85
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,267
Are Clydene and kids getting along alright?

86
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,333
Meaner never gone by the minute.

87
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,504
Put your mule up and come
on inside the house.

88
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,322
There has been some trouble
amongst the women hereabouts.

89
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,986
I've heard about it.

90
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,016
It's bad.

91
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,475
Guess what I'm ordering?

92
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,588
I couldn't...

93
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:57,665
A melodeon.

94
00:11:58,209 --> 00:11:58,709
You are not!

95
00:11:58,809 --> 00:11:59,069
Yeap

96
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,568
I don't trust shipping a piano, so...

97
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:05,953
Soon as I get in the loop, I'm going
to order a Mason and Hamlin melodeon.

98
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,967
You'll have the only melodeon in the territory.

99
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,816
Back home, I used to play the piano by the hour.

100
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,807
I cannot live without real music much longer.

101
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:22,971
I could help you with them dishes.

102
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,877
I don't want any help with the dishes. 

103
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:32,754
So, how you getting along that Giffen boy?

104
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,850
He uses my mules when I don't need them.

105
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,850
He helps me with my corn.

106
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,140
We planted some potatoes together
and we keep the fences up.

107
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:46,861
How you getting along?

108
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:50,114
When my bulls have finished their work here,
I let him turn it turn up on his heifers.

109
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:51,209
Well...

110
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,856
Seems like you are getting
together along alright.

111
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,684
Feed him a meal every now and then...

112
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,253
Like you do me.

113
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,539
You're a good citizen, Mary Bee

114
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,182
The bed up on the loft has
for a sleigh and I.

115
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,232
Take the slop out to the hogs
before you go to sleep.

116
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,629
You're gonna give me a son.

117
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,629
You're gonna give me a son.

118
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,084
Hell no!

119
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,309
This here is a goddamn free country, Dowd!
Can't nobody make me do it.

120
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,985
Thou shalt not take the Lord's
name in vain, Vester.

121
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:54,948
Specially not in His own house.

122
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,100
No I won't go. I can't.

123
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:57,669
Why not?

124
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,634
In the name of our Savior, Vester.
I ask you, why not?

125
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:04,949
I can't take no time away from my crops
and I got the girls to look after...

126
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,850
and I can't afford to pay for no wagon.

127
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,392
I ain't in on this deal.

128
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,982
Then what are we gonna do about Theoline?

129
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,539
Pitch a hole out on the dowd house.

130
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,927
You are a poor specimen of a man,
Vester Belknap!

131
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,975
I came here for the drawing.
Me too.

132
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,612
Let's get it over with.

133
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:25,915
What about Vester?

134
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,448
I will draw for Vester.

135
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,293
What do you mean?

136
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:30,490
I said I'll draw for him.

137
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,684
What did she say?

138
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,974
I Said I'll draw for Vester Belknap.

139
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:37,321
Can we proceed?

140
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:44,059
This is a painful occasion for you and
your families and I grieve for you.

141
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,329
Your wives are fine and godly women.

142
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,348
But life gave them more than they could bear.

143
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,020
Now we'll draw lots.

144
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,142
Whoever draws the black bean

145
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,872
will draw the women home
to where they come from.

146
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,505
Shall we defer the lady?

147
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,892
I will draw the last.
I'll go first.

148
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,230
Keep your hands closed until
everybody has drawn.

149
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,000
Thor.

150
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:08,332
Miss Cuddy.

151
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,285
Put your hands in the circle here.

152
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,752
On the count of three...One...
Felt bean in my hand is black. I dunno...

153
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:17,834
Two.

154
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,750
Three.

155
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:22,426
Does that mean Vester has to go?

156
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:23,582
He said he wouldn't.

157
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,774
He has to, he is one of us.

158
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,524
I baptized him.

159
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,241
I don't trust Vester.
Me neither.

160
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,197
It's true, Reverend.

161
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:36,123
Vester is a brute with no conscience.

162
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:37,801
I'll go.

163
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,066
You can't.

164
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:40,350
Yes I will.

165
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:40,919
A woman?

166
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,684
I can ride as well as anybody.

167
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,225
I can handle a team and shoot.
You all know that.

168
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,142
And I can cook and care for...

169
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:50,276
those women better than any of you can.

170
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:51,400
Oh! She's right.

171
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,600
She sure as hell right!

172
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,802
That's my Connie, Miss Cuddy.

173
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,142
You tell us what you need
and we'll see to it.

174
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,391
When will you leave?

175
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,730
As soon as I can.
Today is May 5.

176
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,719
She could be back in time to
celebrate 4 of July with us.

177
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:08,489
Reverend Dowd, we cannot allow this.

178
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:12,757
It is not a lone woman's place to
draw a wagon across this country.

179
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:17,257
Much less when it carries three of
the Lord's least capable children.

180
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,697
So why not come with me come, Miss Linens?
We can do it together.

181
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,934
You too, Miss Polhemus.
Better still.

182
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,809
Not. You husbands and family to care for.

183
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:25,718
You should.

184
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,236
But I do not. I live uncommonly, alone.
Enough!

185
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,103
Please. Be seated.

186
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,252
I'm afraid y'all are right about Mr.Belknap.

187
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:43,316
He is untrustworthy. With the
task of this gravity...

188
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,254
And we need a Homesman.

189
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,892
We will do everything we can to equip and...

190
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,550
accommodate for this journey, Miss Cuddy.

191
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,993
If you gentlemen will excuse me for a minute.

192
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,934
Come look after your wagon?

193
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:39,979
I did.

194
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,728
My Lord...what is that?

195
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,030
It's train wagon. Trade for it last year.

196
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,552
Since then been sitting out here in the snow.

197
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,598
When Svendsen and Sours came
around here for a wagon,

198
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,567
I gave a hell of a deal on it.
I give it to him!

199
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,708
I cut the windows, a bit bigger...

200
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:05,778
greased it pretty good.

201
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,708
Set some new spokes and fellows.

202
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,717
That's the just the right
thing for them women.

203
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:43,101
I put a sliding bolt on the door.

204
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:45,084
What for?

205
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:46,737
Lock them ladies in.

206
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,153
Why would I do that?

207
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,562
Stop and think about it.

208
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,612
What's that?

209
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,741
You might wanna tie something down...

210
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,679
Put up ten of 'em.

211
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:09,071
Oh my!

212
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,327
I'm not sure I'm ready.

213
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,979
Are you scared?

214
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,098
A little...Listen here, Mary Bee...

215
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,940
You got a passable rig...

216
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:20,584
mules.

217
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,651
and you're as good a man
as any man here abouts.

218
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:29,366
And you're doing a hell of a fine thing..

219
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,008
So go ahead on...

220
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:33,209
get to it...

221
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:35,264
and do it.

222
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,145
Does everybody know?

223
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:40,875
Yeap.

224
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,315
What are they say?

225
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,042
Don't say nothing.

226
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,688
People don't like to talk death and taxes

227
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,357
only when comes to crazy...

228
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,307
they stay hushed up.

229
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:26,998
Miss Cuddy!

230
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:32,654
Mary Bee!

231
00:21:36,354 --> 00:21:36,854
Mary Bee! 

232
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:42,725
I tried to catch you in town,
but you was already gone.

233
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,100
What do you want, Reverend?

234
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,642
To give you these. Letters to
the women's closest kin...

235
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:49,200
around Hebron, Iowa and going back East.

236
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,017
Your journey will be long,
difficult and dangerous.

237
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:55,142
I expect it will.

238
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,119
God bless you woman.

239
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:59,475
Rest will keep you. You know I believe
in you, don't you? You truly do.

240
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,000
I know it.

241
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,243
I go in your place, if I could.

242
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,373
Now let us pray.

243
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:15,266
Heavenly Father, look down upon my daughter.
Bless her in this undertaking.

244
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,458
Grant her thy strength and
guide her with thy grace. .

245
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,651
She may carry home these poor souls.

246
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,380
We beg of Thee.

247
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,324
In the name of Jesus Christ,
thy only begotten son

248
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,406
who gave his life

249
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,335
for the sins of man.

250
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:30,792
Amen.

251
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,471
Come on out outta there! You clay-job...

252
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,187
Son of a bitch!

253
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,395
Cmon down in here,

254
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:49,100
and you'll be a sad bastard long to live. 
and that won't be there long.

255
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,622
Then you'll about understand, you Baffle!

256
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,412
This kit is Bob Giffen's place.

257
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:56,017
Bob Giffen has gone abandoned this place,

258
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,811
and I have a filed a new claim with.

259
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,991
Go on! Get the hell off my roof,
or face stifle recourse! Or I blow you!

260
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:46,750
We need to hang that son of a bitch!

261
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,050
Cmon!

262
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,865
Are you are an angel?

263
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,725
You're not dead.

264
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,294
Help me.

265
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,315
Would you help me?

266
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,559
For God sake?

267
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:30,468
Suppose I do...

268
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:33,789
What would you do for me?

269
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:37,020
Anything! Anything!
God as my witness! 

270
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,267
If I cut you down, would you
do what I tell you to?

271
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:42,108
Yes I will!
Swear to God!

272
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:43,239
You swear to it?

273
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:44,014
I swear...

274
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:48,507
Swear to that Almighty God
you were talking about?

275
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,918
"Vengeance is Mine"

276
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:53,619
Sayth the Lord.

277
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,076
bring in sheaves...

278
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,934
and do another's...

279
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,728
and if you cut me down from this Goddamn tree

280
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,713
and I'll do anything you tell me to.
I swear on God's holy name.

281
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,043
Please...

282
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,861
Alright.

283
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,224
I'll save you.

284
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,609
I gotta a job that'll work for you.

285
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:46,888
But if you try to hurt me,

286
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,300
you try and run away,

287
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,748
I'll kill you.

288
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:00,922
Take off the noose.

289
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,342
I need to collect my possibles.

290
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,684
This is Bob Giffen's place...

291
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,017
I never met him.

292
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,083
What happened to his sheep?
I eat 'em.

293
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:41,178
Now you even blasted up 'em vigilantes
and hanged, for jumping Bob's claim.

294
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,475
Hell! That's abandoned.
Look at it.

295
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,337
He didn't abandon nothing.

296
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,855
He just went back East, find himself a wife.

297
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,736
It's abandoned.

298
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:55,990
I'm sure is.

299
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:02,206
This is abandoned.

300
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:04,584
Damn...

301
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:26,836
Unhitch and stable the mules.

302
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,267
And tend to my mare, Dorothy.

303
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:33,231
and see to it that all the stock
on the place is fed and watered.

304
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:34,822
Your horse needs feed too.

305
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:40,427
Hope you don't care to, I will.
And your supper will be an hour late!

306
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,791
Getup that way now!
Getup there!

307
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:50,875
Step up!

308
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:55,321
Getup there!

309
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,561
Cleanup before you come in.

310
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,724
What's this job work you have in mind?

311
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:03,943
Would be grateful if you not
use my good chair that way.

312
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,017
My name is Cuddy.
Mary Bee Cuddy.

313
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,335
Where is Mr.Cuddy?

314
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,588
I'm unmarried.

315
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,463
What's the job?

316
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,884
Three women in this country
have lost their minds...

317
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,559
their husbands can't care for them properly.

318
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:24,738
You and I are gonna take them
back across the river to Iowa.

319
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,184
The Missouri River?
We're leave tomorrow.

320
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:29,182
Hell, that's five goddamn weeks from here!

321
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,566
I will not sit still for
profanity in my house.

322
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,324
I see why you're single!

323
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:42,715
I need someone who can hunt and guide
and spell me at the rains...

324
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,684
and help me with the animals on the trip.

325
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,070
That's why I set you free.

326
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:50,430
It's your job and you sworn you do it.

327
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,344
Three crazy women for five weeks
is a lot more than I bargained for.

328
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,300
If you lied to me...

329
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,309
and intent on abandoning your responsibility,

330
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,375
then you are a man of low character.

331
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,173
more, disgusting pig than honorable man

332
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:10,225
Thank you for the kind words, sister.
You know no pride in yourself...

333
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,903
plain as no ten pail and you are bossy!

334
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:17,250
But I'll sit out with you,
because I said I would...

335
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,059
and I'll help you tang your cuckoo-cuckoo
clocks as long as it suits me.

336
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:24,600
However,I'll up and leave
when, where and if I please.

337
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,214
Now, if you don't mind me asking you, 
where the hell is my Goddamn bed?

338
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,183
In the stable.

339
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:31,903
Where you belong.

340
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,258
What are you doing, Mom?

341
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:56,753
I am cleaning.

342
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,338
I see you clean.

343
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:01,584
Why?

344
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:04,286
Why do you clean?

345
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:06,710
Our house is clean.

346
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,671
Our house was always clean.

347
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,462
Mom, you've lost your mind.

348
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,554
Soil is made of dust.

349
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,660
You intend to dust off the dust?

350
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,118
# This house will be clean #

351
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,454
# Cleanliness is next to godliness #

352
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,754
# Up there, at the crossroads #

353
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,414
# There is a small house #

354
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:50,706
# Whose walls are curved #

355
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,796
# Up there, at the crossroads #

356
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,701
# There is a small house... #

357
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,743
The winds blown all the corn over.

358
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:06,167
I know it.

359
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,362
All we can do is burn the cobs and the stove.

360
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:13,740
There ain't more corn for us to eat.

361
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:15,930
Just cobs.

362
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:18,625
Just bare old cobs.

363
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:19,667
I know it.

364
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,684
The wheat and Oats are dead.

365
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:22,525
I know it well.

366
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,406
What do you know?

367
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,411
Are you crazy?

368
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,656
Pull up there.

369
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,270
Better lock me in the wagon.

370
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:46,209
Why?

371
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,059
I didn't cheat them one rope, I don't wanna change
another, sons of bitches try to hang me again.

372
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:50,649
Or...

373
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:53,403
You might be recognized.

374
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:16,892
You got any money?

375
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:17,529
Some.

376
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,500
Why?

377
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:23,100
Just need 3 boxes of paper cartridges,
a navy coach and a jug of whiskey.

378
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,030
Bullets maybe. But no whiskey.

379
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,086
Why not?

380
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:29,384
Can't have you drunk around
poor defenseless women. No.

381
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,623
So I won't go East with you.
Goodbye, Cuddy.

382
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:43,990
What's your name?

383
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,059
That's my business.

384
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,533
I going to the bank and I need your name.

385
00:34:49,584 --> 00:34:51,486
oh well, hmmm. It's George.

386
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:52,400
George what?

387
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:56,542
Umm...Briggs.

388
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,119
George Briggs.

389
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,562
That's right.

390
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:06,802
George Briggs.
George Briggs.

391
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:25,834
Read this.

392
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:31,468
Here I'll read it for you.

393
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,684
"Mr.George Briggs, care of Mrs Altha Carter", Lady's 8th Society

394
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:37,392
"Methodist Church Hebron, Iowa"

395
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:37,961
So?

396
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,969
I put banknotes for $300 inside
this envelope. This for you.

397
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:44,513
Oh! Why not let me have it now?

398
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,035
Right this minute I'm going to the
Post Office, put it in the mail.

399
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,213
Why not carry it along with us?

400
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,938
When we get to Hebron, Miss Carter
will have it for you.

401
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:14,063
Her boy is not very not old.
We'll have to watch him close.

402
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:16,920
Don't know what he'll do
when we take Arabella away.

403
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:53,128
Ma'am...

404
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,509
Well there she is.

405
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:05,604
My wife, Belle.

406
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:09,287
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs Sours.

407
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:14,614
She won't say nothing, Miss Cuddy.

408
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:17,816
She just sits there and
looks out the window...

409
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:21,947
it's that her body is all stoved up.

410
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:28,259
I have to carry her to the hour house...

411
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:30,725
Undress her nights, dress her in the morning

412
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,702
How long she been like this?

413
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,378
Ever since...

414
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:41,297
I don't even know her no more.

415
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:43,479
How old is your wife?

416
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:45,834
Nineteen.

417
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:46,628
And you?

418
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:48,375
Twenty one

419
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:50,459
I see.

420
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,677
Ma'am, she was beautiful, Miss Cuddy.

421
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:00,823
She maybe once again.

422
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:06,193
Mr.Briggs, would you iter up your
leisure long enough to lend a hand? 

423
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,084
Now.

424
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:40,695
I wish you God's comfort, Garn.

425
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:47,536
Here's...here's this too.

426
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,059
Her grandma's wedding gift.

427
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:52,377
I reckon that should go with her.

428
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:56,325
I'll keep it for her and
see she takes it home.

429
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,392
We'll be back in a few weeks.

430
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:01,342
And you would hear from either
me or Reverend Dawd she's fine.

431
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:09,917
Goodbye!

432
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:18,010
Goodbye!

433
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,107
You don't love me?

434
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,320
You won't even look at me.

435
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,015
You won't think a damn.

436
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,951
Just go on home and pet your damn doll.

437
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:33,055
Leave me up against it.

438
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,758
You don't love me?

439
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,528
Bye...go to the devil!
Just goto hell.

440
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:45,010
Bye!

441
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,133
You don't love me.

442
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,361
Good Morning, Mr.Svendsen.

443
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:03,919
Come in.

444
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,884
She is ready.

445
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,293
Why she tied?

446
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:16,713
"God will strike you down",
she says to me.

447
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,929
She thinks she's God.

448
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:38,142
Her cousin will pickup in Iowa
and take her to asylum.

449
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:38,847
Stop it!

450
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,028
How will we get her loaded?

451
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,708
Unbolt the wagon door.

452
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,010
Stop it!
Stop it!

453
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:15,879
Open the the wagon door!

454
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,301
Help me.
Push in.

455
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,202
Do not untie her.

456
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:32,728
She will try to kill you,

457
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,701
she'll try to kill her, too.

458
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:35,131
Come down!

459
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,809
What are you doing with that son of a bitch?
No!

460
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:45,990
He's going with us.

461
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,778
He's the one who tried to
take Bob Giffen's place.

462
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:50,767
I need help.
Surely you understand!

463
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,153
He was suppose to hang.

464
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,112
Mr.Svendsen.

465
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,864
Get down of that wagon.

466
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,021
Get down of that wagon right now!

467
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:02,010
Or I'll shoot you where you sit.

468
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,705
I can't do this alone.
I need him.

469
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,195
Now you leave us be!

470
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,204
Get us moving.

471
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:14,022
You boys don't have balls to hang me! You wanted
my horse to do it for you, didn't ya?

472
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:15,904
Cmon! Let's go.

473
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:21,537
Keep that gun on that son of a bitch.

474
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:29,156
I'll watch over your wife, Mr.Svendsen, I promise.

475
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,380
It will be safe with me.

476
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:16,971
You'll give me a son...

477
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:19,062
But you refuse.

478
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:24,250
You'll receive my seed, woman.

479
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:27,357
You will bear my child.

480
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,099
You girls goto your room
while I talk to your mama.

481
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:14,340
Theoline, this is Mary Bee.

482
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:16,568
Undo!
Undo your hands? I am.

483
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:18,104
Undo, undo...

484
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,541
Do you know me, Theoline?

485
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:24,241
Undo, undo...

486
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:25,286
Line, darling,

487
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:28,392
I am, Mary Bee, your friend.

488
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,695
Don't you know me?

489
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,077
Now listen, girls...

490
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:01,175
your mother is very sick.

491
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:07,319
But she loves you the
same as she always has.

492
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:10,886
And you must love her too and
help as much as you can.

493
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,911
I want some things,
I want you to do for her

494
00:45:14,084 --> 00:45:16,465
Want you to undress her,
heat some water...

495
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:19,237
and give her a nice bath.
With soap.

496
00:45:20,334 --> 00:45:21,490
From face to feet.

497
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:22,665
Right on the bed?

498
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:24,097
Right on the bed.

499
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:27,579
Wash and dry her hair too.
Then brush and comb it.

500
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:30,938
Then find some clean clothes
for her and underwear...

501
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:33,252
and dress her again.

502
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:37,911
Now while you do all this,

503
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:41,074
I want you to smile at her
and say kind things.

504
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:43,755
Do you know a little
song you can sing?

505
00:45:44,834 --> 00:45:47,283
We know "Flow gently, sweet Afton"

506
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:49,808
That would be fine.

507
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,811
And when you're finished with this, I want
you to do chores for your father too.

508
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,429
You are now the ladies of the house.

509
00:45:58,334 --> 00:45:59,218
I want you to sweep it out,

510
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:05,070
wash the dirty dishes, take the
bedding outdoors and air it...

511
00:46:06,084 --> 00:46:07,989
Show him how grown up you are.

512
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,756
Will you do that for him, for me?

513
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:13,354
Alright.

514
00:46:14,209 --> 00:46:14,753
Now start singing.

515
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:19,006
# Flow gently, sweet Afton
Among thy green braes #

516
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,418
And remember,

517
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,372
love your dear mother.

518
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:27,241
Now get busy as bees.

519
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:35,008
# Flow gently, I'll sing thee a song in thy praise #

520
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:39,968
# My Mary's asleep by thy murmuring stream #

521
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:46,018
# Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream #

522
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:51,014
# Thou stock-dove whose echo resounds tho' the glen #

523
00:46:51,114 --> 00:46:58,314
# Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den,
Thou green-crested lapwing thy screaming forbear #

524
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,769
Miss Svendsen, is that you?

525
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:19,513
Please, stop wailing, Miss Svendsen

526
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:25,142
Miss Svendsen, I asked you to stop.

527
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:27,548
Please do!

528
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,029
Stop!

529
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,304
Miss Svendsen, do stop!

530
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:29,594
You think these mules will make it
all the way to the  Missouri river?

531
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:32,355
I doubt it, without a good feeding of corn.

532
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:36,184
The one putting her ears, she knows
she's the subject of our discussion..

533
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:40,017
She's a thinker.
The other ones a worker.

534
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,675
They should have names,
what should we name them?

535
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:45,809
Mules don't need names. They need feed,
corn's the best there is.

536
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:49,235
I'll name that one Grace,
and that one redemption.

537
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:53,059
My mare, her name is Dorothy, after my sister. 

538
00:48:53,084 --> 00:48:57,642
She's married to a doctor up in New York state.
That's where we are from.

539
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:00,932
Dorothy has a little six year
old boy and a baby on the way.

540
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,223
My mother died when we were little girls.

541
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,859
What's your horse's name?

542
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:14,459
Brown.

543
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:57,708
You didn't give me the two dove's skinny blankets.
It gets cold the night out here!

544
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:58,858
You noticed.

545
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,725
You need to head south-east,
follow the river bottoms.

546
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,250
No.

547
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,447
We'll meet more people that way
in case we need help. 

548
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:11,600
You know, there are three kinds
of people out here...

549
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,278
And you gonna meet wagon trains that
don't want to see crazy people.

550
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:16,517
You gonna meet traders
who will surely rape you...

551
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:18,623
And you gonna meet the Indians,
who will kill you and then rape you.

552
00:50:19,722 --> 00:50:21,267
After they kill me, no!

553
00:50:21,312 --> 00:50:23,725
We gonna go straight East to the river.

554
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,043
We've a hell of an odd lot I'm afraid.

555
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:27,947
They are not afraid,
they are human beings.

556
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,370
They are crazy.

557
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,009
They are precious to the Lord.

558
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,194
Precious to me too. 

559
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:34,945
Give me that skillet.
That's $300 worth.

560
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,554
Wakeup! Time to get moving!

561
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:44,042
Getup and go pee!

562
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:49,016
Go on, there now.

563
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:57,653
Watch your head on the hub there.

564
00:50:58,653 --> 00:51:00,003
Baby go on!

565
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:07,946
Shall we.

566
00:51:19,084 --> 00:51:19,584
Pee.

567
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:22,378
Goddamn!

568
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:29,055
Squat now!

569
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:32,794
Go pee.

570
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:31,125
God

571
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,338
will strike you down.

572
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:05,145
God will strike you down.

573
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:13,304
I love trees.

574
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:16,364
I don't to see many trees.

575
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:18,375
I miss them.

576
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,562
God will strike...

577
00:56:25,084 --> 00:56:26,036
New York...

578
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,640
has lots of trees.

579
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:16,759
Surely you wouldn't defy or desecrate...

580
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,031
You are horrible.

581
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:20,582
And morbid!

582
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:32,980
I do not wanna be cold anymore
while I'm trying to sleep.

583
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:37,136
I need this buffalo hide,
that dead Indian don't.

584
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,098
I was in the Dragoons.

585
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,778
Company say 1st US Division.

586
00:57:58,292 --> 00:57:59,380
Fort Kearney.

587
00:58:01,334 --> 00:58:05,960
Had a riots club one time there
in Kansas with them goddamn Kiowas!

588
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:07,792
Tell me.

589
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:10,822
We headed out to Fort Leavenworth.

590
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:12,968
Supply chain...

591
00:58:13,792 --> 00:58:16,717
Six mule wagons and a herd of 300 horses.

592
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:20,551
And we had Kiowas like flees trailing us!

593
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:22,640
War paints. Sassy.

594
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:24,932
"Big as life and twice as natural"

595
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:27,732
Want them horses.

596
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:29,625
I see.

597
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,879
Well we camped down Arkansas River one night

598
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:38,312
and them teamsters picketed 36 mules and...

599
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:40,934
they picketed 300 horses in the sand.

600
00:58:41,542 --> 00:58:42,042
Sand!

601
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:46,730
Hell them picket fence won't hold
prairie dog in the sand.

602
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:49,039
Sure enough, that night,

603
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:54,892
Kiowas come through, stomped-ed the
bunch and away they went.

604
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,767
Travel wagons all in pieces.

605
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:01,037
The stock all tangled up in the ropes,

606
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:02,853
all crippled up with the flying picket fence.

607
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:07,344
And them Kiowas just running through
there just hooping and hauling.

608
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:09,895
My oh my. Won't we rewed!

609
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:16,893
We blew bugles, boots and saddles and
away went after them with the sun rising

610
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,517
We caught Kiowas here and Kiowas there.

611
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:23,287
We caught them in bunches and
killed every one of 'em.

612
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:27,432
We rounded up our stock and 
go right through the middle...

613
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,451
of goddamn Kiowas camp up that hill 

614
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:34,196
Pretty fine job! It works.

615
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:39,070
Company C 1st U.S Dragoon!

616
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:41,372
Well how interesting.

617
00:59:48,875 --> 01:00:00,000
# I want your waving wheat and dun want your Barley #
[Native American Dance]

618
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,486
# Ah there cherry tree #

619
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:03,982
# there goes the cherry #

620
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:07,965
# The more you have kids girl #

621
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,087
# More do you marry # 

622
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:15,142
# Charlie, he's fine young boy #

623
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,072
# Charlie, he's a dandy #

624
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,278
# Everytime he goes town #

625
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:22,024
# He rain girls some candy #

626
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:38,998
What are they?

627
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:40,740
Pawnee, probably.

628
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:44,850
What was that?

629
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:45,375
Bugle.

630
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:49,730
Somewhere along the line they
killed themselves US cavalry bugler.

631
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:55,516
What do they want?

632
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:59,100
Whatever we got...trouble is
they don't know what that is.

633
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:00,830
Trouble is they never seen a wagon...

634
01:01:00,855 --> 01:01:02,488
as could be goods inside...

635
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:03,733
soldiers.

636
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,767
Anything to them.
Hell they don't know.

637
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:09,558
I count four rifles amongst 'em.

638
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,203
I think if we were worth
the trouble, we're dead.

639
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:25,364
I'll try to buy 'em off.

640
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:36,767
Something happens to me,they
come all the way down here.

641
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:37,948
Don't you fill that carbine.

642
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:40,884
You get in the wagon quick as you can.

643
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:43,122
Shoot the women in the
head then shoot yourself

644
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:46,721
You got four good rounds.

645
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:16,597
Come here.

646
01:02:18,292 --> 01:02:18,792
Ho! Get out of here

647
01:02:19,584 --> 01:02:20,084
Get out of here!

648
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:39,068
What will they do with Dorothy?

649
01:02:40,042 --> 01:02:42,126
They probably eat her.

650
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,042
No!

651
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:46,619
What the hell?

652
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:02,149
She's gone, Mr.Briggs!

653
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:02,957
Mr.Briggs! She's gone!

654
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,559
She's gone! We have to get her back!

655
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:08,033
Cuddy that was a god dammed horse.

656
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:09,187
Stand up, you wrought!

657
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:28,952
She hasn't taken a step by herself
since we put her on the wagon.

658
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,452
Hells Bells...

659
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:35,239
That gal didn't run off.

660
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:53,959
Morning!
Morning!

661
01:04:55,334 --> 01:04:57,100
Where you from, friend?

662
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,846
Freight crane, camped down south little ways.

663
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:00,917
Bigger?

664
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:03,184
Thirty wagons, six yolk.

665
01:05:03,209 --> 01:05:05,767
Two weeks ago outta Fall City
headed for Salt Lake.

666
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,221
You their driver?

667
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:10,504
I am! Out hunting' meat, you seen any?

668
01:05:11,084 --> 01:05:13,941
No not today. I am out looking
for this young lady here.

669
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:15,457
She's lost.

670
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:16,805
She ain't now.

671
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,338
Friend...

672
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,948
I gotta frame wagon back there,

673
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:26,436
I am carrying three crazy women
to a church in Iowa...

674
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:29,899
so they can go home back East.

675
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,701
This young girl is one of 'em.

676
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:33,729
She is married.

677
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:35,940
She's married. Her name is Sours.

678
01:05:37,342 --> 01:05:40,671
She had three little children.
Lost 'em all to the diphtheria...

679
01:05:40,742 --> 01:05:42,766
in short order and lost her mind.

680
01:05:44,584 --> 01:05:46,557
She ran away from us last night.

681
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:49,187
I'm a friend.

682
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:50,742
So am I.

683
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:53,809
So you won't wanna not waste her yet.

684
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:55,943
She can spread her legs, can't she?

685
01:05:58,959 --> 01:05:59,911
I tell you what?

686
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,383
Why don't we leave it to her.

687
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,884
See here sweet thing...

688
01:06:04,709 --> 01:06:07,158
Who you ready to go with?
Him or me?

689
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,548
You lady be, she caught
me stun and love already.

690
01:06:12,709 --> 01:06:14,447
Friend, I'm taking this girl home.

691
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:16,515
Not likely. She mine now.

692
01:06:17,584 --> 01:06:20,142
Possession is not pointing' to the law,

693
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:22,072
so all level us out here, ain't it?

694
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:24,375
Sorry, I'll just have to have her.

695
01:06:24,834 --> 01:06:25,446
God Almighty!

696
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:33,528
Fight you for her.
Best man takes the prize, how's that?

697
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:34,486
I'm agreeable.

698
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:35,292
Alright.

699
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,523
I say "pitch", we pitch these guns.
How's that?

700
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:40,577
Anytime.

701
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:43,750
Pitch!

702
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:47,279
God Almighty!

703
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,599
Say it again and act right this time.

704
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:53,875
Pitch!

705
01:08:13,459 --> 01:08:13,959
Goodbye.

706
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,085
Did you have to take an eternity?

707
01:08:19,084 --> 01:08:20,240
She nearly froze to death.

708
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:25,184
You had lost a horse Cuddy,
here's another one.

709
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:28,059
Who did you get this horse?
Man let us have him.

710
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:28,584
Why would he do that?

711
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:32,842
Because he's dead.
Ms Sours shot him.

712
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,467
Who would do such a thing?

713
01:08:59,834 --> 01:09:00,378
Indians.

714
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:02,301
For the clothes.

715
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:24,625
Wolves.

716
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:39,082
"Cissy Hahn"

717
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,710
"Eleven years, two months, nine days"

718
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:46,511
"God loved her and took her home onto Him"

719
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:47,713
Let's go, Cuddy.

720
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,361
I intend to tidy up this grave.

721
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:54,267
Getting late.
I don't care.

722
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:56,401
Suit yourself, I'm going' home.

723
01:09:57,417 --> 01:09:59,730
Then I'll take a horse
and join you later

724
01:10:00,084 --> 01:10:00,696
Not mine you won't.

725
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,065
You have to ride that plain horse.

726
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:10,005
I want a shovel too.

727
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,899
O Sweet Merciful Father,

728
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:38,191
Prince Jesus.

729
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:40,551
Good Shepherd.

730
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,201
Harvester of righteousnesses.

731
01:10:45,417 --> 01:10:47,866
Take 'em thee token and bury them deep,

732
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:51,209
carry in...carry in.

733
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:54,462
in love let us sleep.

734
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,362
Send me summons to wed Thee one day,

735
01:10:59,167 --> 01:10:59,711
Love us,

736
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:01,858
And love me.

737
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:05,120
O love me, I pray.

738
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,000
Amen.

739
01:14:38,334 --> 01:14:40,234
Why...why?

740
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:42,919
Why didn't you light a fire for me?

741
01:14:58,334 --> 01:14:59,627
What about supper?

742
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,048
I did light a fire for you Cuddy.

743
01:15:10,292 --> 01:15:11,857
Where's that shovel?

744
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:16,498
I lost the goddamn shovel!

745
01:15:16,959 --> 01:15:18,932
Who cares about a shovel?

746
01:15:21,209 --> 01:15:24,093
You are...insane!

747
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:25,099
The hell I am...Cuddy, trying...

748
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,725
to move alone to the river as
quick as I can and draw that $300

749
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:31,838
That's all there is.

750
01:15:33,959 --> 01:15:35,592
There ain't no more.

751
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:16,999
# If I should prosper #

752
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:19,812
# Hear my heart pray #.

753
01:16:21,334 --> 01:16:24,647
# Send me a summons to wed thee wonder #

754
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:31,375
# Take me this token and love me all way #

755
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:39,878
# But if I should perish, I promise to keep #

756
01:16:39,959 --> 01:16:44,252
# Take our thee two hearts and bury them here #

757
01:16:45,959 --> 01:16:51,564
# Take Thee our tokens and love let us sleep #

758
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,394
I couldn't sleep.

759
01:17:20,209 --> 01:17:20,957
I could.

760
01:17:21,584 --> 01:17:22,945
How long now we get there?

761
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:27,415
Week...

762
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:28,915
whereabouts.

763
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:31,708
Maybe a month. Hell I dunno.

764
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:38,267
It's almost over now. We stay in
Iowa or come back to the territory?

765
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,244
I dunno.

766
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:42,370
You are not much reckon plans.

767
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:44,562
No, not much.

768
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:47,430
Mr.Briggs,

769
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:49,593
you're an intelligent man...

770
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:52,456
and if you think on it,

771
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:54,717
I'm sure you will see the wisdom in it.

772
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,813
After you have turned
them over to Mrs Carter...

773
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:02,024
why don't we marry and come back together.

774
01:18:03,042 --> 01:18:06,809
I'm 31 years old and if I'll
ever marry, it better be soon. 

775
01:18:06,834 --> 01:18:08,603
You are not getting any younger.

776
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:11,469
You see my house, my stock...

777
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:15,344
I've cut two fine claims
and money in the bank...

778
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:17,844
I am in good health and
capable of child bearing.

779
01:18:19,334 --> 01:18:23,010
I plan to buy shoats next spring
and fattens them on corn...

780
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:23,810
and come next April... 

781
01:18:23,917 --> 01:18:27,454
I'll have 60 acres into wheat.

782
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:31,338
I plan to put in pumpkins too.

783
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,840
We make a good team you and I.

784
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:40,408
If we pull together, we are bound
to prosper. Do you agree?

785
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:41,698
I'm no farmer.

786
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:45,072
Well you could try...
you could try.

787
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,100
I've tried it one time,
when we were...

788
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,213
north of Wamego.

789
01:18:48,792 --> 01:18:52,600
Cutting 'em god dammed rows,
daylight to dark.

790
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:55,267
These prettier to look at
than ass end of an Ox.

791
01:18:55,292 --> 01:18:56,585
One morning I just rode off.

792
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,140
You deserted her.

793
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,517
When I left her, I was sorry.
But I never did look back.

794
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:05,042
I see.

795
01:19:06,334 --> 01:19:08,443
So you won't marry me?

796
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:10,125
No.

797
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,406
I won't.

798
01:19:13,084 --> 01:19:15,533
I know, I am plain as an old tin pail...

799
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,105
but would you think about it from here to
Hebron and talk to me about it again?

800
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:22,493
Talks cheap.

801
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:24,639
Mr.Briggs

802
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:28,776
perhaps you don't realize what a
grand thing you are doing taking....

803
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:30,392
these poor helpless women home.

804
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:35,210
If you don't, I assure you the
good Lord does and I do.

805
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:39,225
Might be the most fine generous act of your life.

806
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:40,951
It might be $300.

807
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,800
You won't marry me?

808
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,050
No

809
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,280
Then I am plain...

810
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:57,110
I wish you say one kind word to me.

811
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:57,889
Like what?

812
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,725
That I'm a good woman...
I helped you.

813
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:04,491
Fair enough. You are a damn good woman
and you helped me.

814
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:16,230
I deserted from the Dragoons.

815
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,287
That's right, Company C 1st U.S

816
01:20:21,959 --> 01:20:24,204
Fort Kearney. Stole a horse and way I run.

817
01:20:26,459 --> 01:20:27,888
Ain't attached to nothing.

818
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:31,003
Just me.

819
01:20:52,005 --> 01:20:53,175
No

820
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:54,375
I want

821
01:20:55,334 --> 01:20:57,103
to lay with you.

822
01:20:57,203 --> 01:20:58,203
No

823
01:20:59,042 --> 01:20:59,586
You must.

824
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:01,599
I saved your life.

825
01:21:03,009 --> 01:21:04,099
Well...

826
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:15,698
Please,

827
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:17,695
spare me my dignity, sir.

828
01:22:00,459 --> 01:22:01,275
Raise your knees.

829
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:08,388
Take me in your hand.

830
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:14,046
Just remember Cuddy, I didn't force you.

831
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:16,457
I will.

832
01:22:16,459 --> 01:22:18,184
If it hurt you, you can't help it.

833
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:18,709
I know.

834
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:21,725
You asked me. I didn't ask you.

835
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:22,250
I know.

836
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:24,721
So let me in you.

837
01:22:26,459 --> 01:22:26,959
Yes.

838
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:11,500
Cuddy?

839
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:17,042
Cuddy!

840
01:23:17,142 --> 01:23:17,942
Cuddy!

841
01:24:22,459 --> 01:24:24,100
My God of heaven, Cuddy

842
01:24:24,209 --> 01:24:26,934
we made a deal to carry
these women back to Iowa...

843
01:24:26,959 --> 01:24:29,408
I kept my word and here
you are you. Broke yours.

844
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,044
See here?

845
01:24:53,084 --> 01:24:55,392
You see what you done?
You killed her.

846
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,594
Look at her! You killed her!

847
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:01,603
Can't have crazy picks look at her.
Goddamn lunatics!

848
01:25:02,584 --> 01:25:04,829
You don't know nothing about this world.

849
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:07,842
Can't even piss straight.

850
01:25:11,334 --> 01:25:13,579
Hadn't been for you, Mary Bee wouldn't be dead.

851
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,247
She wouldn't leave me out here!

852
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:22,600
If you hadn't going crazy,
she wouldn't have made this trip

853
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:27,892
If you had stayed steady and
strong, she did be alive...

854
01:25:27,917 --> 01:25:29,414
and at her home. In her own house.

855
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,336
And so would you, but no.

856
01:25:32,437 --> 01:25:37,977
You went crazy and drove her crazy. That
killed her. You do you gotta say about that?

857
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:16,917
Well I'll be...

858
01:26:39,959 --> 01:26:41,115
I'm going' home by myself.

859
01:26:43,792 --> 01:26:45,792
You on your own.

860
01:26:46,792 --> 01:26:49,989
Follow long enough East someone will
come along and attend to you.

861
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:56,259
Neither a damn one of you,
understand a word I am saying.

862
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:39,483
O my God.

863
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:06,875
How do?

864
01:30:07,834 --> 01:30:11,392
Got them three women outside, haven't
had anything to eat for three days.

865
01:30:11,417 --> 01:30:14,070
They need supper now, rooms for
the night and a hot bath.

866
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,599
We are fill up.

867
01:30:18,459 --> 01:30:19,139
With what?

868
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:20,750
People.

869
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:26,550
mister I didn't come here for trouble.

870
01:30:27,834 --> 01:30:29,934
Well I'm tired. When I'm tired
I'm easy to aggravate

871
01:30:29,959 --> 01:30:32,850
Now this is a hotel, I got money.

872
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:34,780
I want supper now, then I
want a room for myself...

873
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:37,508
and a room for three women.

874
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:41,107
And four hot baths.
Reasonable or not?

875
01:30:41,459 --> 01:30:42,411
Wait here a minute.

876
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:04,961
Greetings!

877
01:31:05,584 --> 01:31:06,084
How do?

878
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:10,388
My name is Aloysius Duffy,
and yours is?

879
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,250
Briggs.

880
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:13,026
I understand you are in need of a meal...

881
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:15,267
and accommodations, Mr.Briggs

882
01:31:15,292 --> 01:31:18,557
That's right.
Myself and three passengers. Women

883
01:31:19,937 --> 01:31:21,994
Unusual cargo, should I say.

884
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:24,708
In any case, Mr.Briggs...
I regret I cannot oblige you

885
01:31:26,417 --> 01:31:28,730
Why not?
This is a hotel, ain't?

886
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:30,486
Have a drink on the house.

887
01:31:37,417 --> 01:31:38,233
Grand.

888
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:43,244
There she went.

889
01:31:44,584 --> 01:31:49,000
Now then, Mr.Briggs, you couldn't
have shown up at an auspicious time

890
01:31:49,105 --> 01:31:51,100
So happens a party of 16...

891
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:56,100
potential investors is coming from
St.Louis by steamboat and coach.

892
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:59,458
I trust you recognize, we cannot
accommodate anyone else.

893
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:03,392
These are gentlemen of means...

894
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:06,182
and the fate of our venture
may very well depend on...

895
01:32:06,234 --> 01:32:07,671
We had a bad winter.

896
01:32:08,084 --> 01:32:09,308
Drive a long way to get here.

897
01:32:10,167 --> 01:32:13,432
And they had nothing to eat for three days.

898
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:15,097
I'm sorry.

899
01:32:16,084 --> 01:32:17,581
The women are in bad shape,

900
01:32:19,792 --> 01:32:20,540
awful hungry.

901
01:32:24,084 --> 01:32:25,172
Let me see them.

902
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:48,077
Good God.

903
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,293
You can't turn us away.

904
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,468
I can't...

905
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:04,722
Mr.Briggs

906
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,335
those women are pitiful, I can see it.

907
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,600
But we can't have them here tonight.

908
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:12,530
The milk of human kindness be damned.

909
01:33:13,709 --> 01:33:18,104
And kindly, be out the door and
take that wagon away from here.

910
01:33:18,209 --> 01:33:19,433
And God speed to you.

911
01:33:22,009 --> 01:33:25,474
Shoes on the other foot now,
you put them guns on the floor

912
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,881
real careful and get us supper
on the table right goddamn now.

913
01:33:32,042 --> 01:33:34,151
Shoes back where it belongs Mr.Briggs.

914
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:38,618
Grand. Well done.

915
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,655
Be on your way, my friend

916
01:33:42,084 --> 01:33:44,809
And lament your neglect of my
offer of glass of whiskey 

917
01:33:44,834 --> 01:33:48,916
Fine. But I tell you what,
you are the worst of...

918
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,883
lying thieving sons of
bitches is ever I run into.

919
01:33:52,959 --> 01:33:56,428
You turn your back on these poor women you answer for it for the rest of your lives

920
01:33:57,667 --> 01:33:59,028
You won't sleep.

921
01:33:59,417 --> 01:34:01,934
You choke on your whiskey and water

922
01:34:02,417 --> 01:34:04,594
The food you eat will
block up your bowels...

923
01:34:06,084 --> 01:34:08,350
you will die of your own shit.

924
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:09,940
Your mother and your sisters,

925
01:34:10,584 --> 01:34:13,197
your wives and your daughters....

926
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:15,129
will curse your broke dicks old.

927
01:34:17,667 --> 01:34:18,211
Get on!

928
01:34:31,209 --> 01:34:33,386
O for God sake...

929
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:14,528
I'll wanna go get us something to eat.

926
01:35:15,792 --> 01:35:18,6922
Now you all be good girls and goto sleep.

930
01:35:18,792 --> 01:35:20,016
I'll be back directly.

931
01:36:08,459 --> 01:36:09,479
You need to get on outta here.

932
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:21,323
Don't look back, don-nit.

933
01:36:53,542 --> 01:36:54,835
Son of a bitch!

934
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,112
Goddamn that hurts!

935
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:05,029
Ah shite...

936
01:40:01,334 --> 01:40:04,327
She looked ridiculous, with that...

937
01:40:05,334 --> 01:40:08,259
Pardon Ma'am, I'm looking
for a woman named  Altha Carter

938
01:40:08,584 --> 01:40:10,489
do you know where her house is at?

939
01:40:10,542 --> 01:40:11,766
That would be the Minister's wife?

940
01:40:12,209 --> 01:40:13,161
Yes, ma'am it would be.

941
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:17,767
Go on down to the Methodist church.
House across the street,

942
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,765
that's the presbytery.

943
01:40:20,459 --> 01:40:21,275
Alright, ma'am.

944
01:40:21,959 --> 01:40:22,639
Thank you.

945
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,883
Come Maisy. Don't look at him.

946
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:21,125
Sir?

947
01:41:23,334 --> 01:41:25,715
Afternoon, ma'am.
Are you Mrs.Altha Carter.

948
01:41:25,792 --> 01:41:27,425
wife of the Methodist Minister?

949
01:41:27,584 --> 01:41:28,604
I am.

950
01:41:28,917 --> 01:41:32,727
Well, my name is Briggs.
I am from the territories.

951
01:41:32,959 --> 01:41:34,592
I brought you three women.

952
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:36,562
Women?

953
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:44,368
Goodness sakes, yes!

954
01:41:47,334 --> 01:41:50,675
You've a long time coming, Mr.Briggs.

955
01:41:50,759 --> 01:41:54,559
I am relieved you are here.
I'm sorry Reverend Carter, isn't.

956
01:41:54,584 --> 01:41:57,305
He's out burying a beloved
member of our congregation.

957
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:03,434
Just a minute...I thought a woman
named Cuddy was bringing' em.

958
01:42:03,459 --> 01:42:05,767
that's what Reverend Dowd wrote.

959
01:42:05,792 --> 01:42:07,934
She was with us up to a week ago, ma'am.

960
01:42:07,959 --> 01:42:10,748
I'm sorry to tell you
that a fever took her.

961
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:14,079
I Buried her and we moved on.

962
01:42:15,042 --> 01:42:16,062
Mary Bee Cuddy.

963
01:42:17,334 --> 01:42:18,899
Was his name.

964
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:22,042
Oh what a...

965
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:24,077
terrible loss.

966
01:42:24,959 --> 01:42:27,612
She must have been a fine brave human being.

967
01:42:27,917 --> 01:42:28,733
She truly was.

968
01:42:32,042 --> 01:42:33,879
They have ridden all this way

969
01:42:34,625 --> 01:42:35,441
in that box?

970
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:38,625
O Mercy!

971
01:42:43,292 --> 01:42:45,857
Well...it's time to meet them.

972
01:42:48,292 --> 01:42:50,129
I'm not sure I'm ready.

973
01:43:14,459 --> 01:43:16,840
You must have had an awful winter.

974
01:43:17,084 --> 01:43:18,036
We did, ma'am.

975
01:43:43,834 --> 01:43:45,807
Put them on the satin, Mr.Briggs.

976
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,248
Do they speak?

977
01:43:55,348 --> 01:43:56,358
No

978
01:44:05,125 --> 01:44:07,030
Do they understand anything?

979
01:44:07,792 --> 01:44:08,880
Ma'am,I don't know...

980
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:15,122
I noticed their eyes
move around the room,

981
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,405
what's that mean?

982
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:19,884
that's hard to tell.

983
01:44:22,084 --> 01:44:24,193
Perhaps each remembers a parlor

984
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:26,707
from their own past.

985
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:29,123
Poor poor dears.

986
01:44:31,709 --> 01:44:34,090
Have you noticed any improvement
in their condition?

987
01:44:34,667 --> 01:44:38,408
They don't scrap with each other
and don't run off anymore.

988
01:44:38,792 --> 01:44:40,153
Tell me their names.

989
01:44:40,584 --> 01:44:43,169
This Theoline Belknap. She killed her baby.
Oh no no no!

990
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:46,127
Please don't tell me, Mr.Briggs
Don't care to know.

991
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:51,522
That one is Nordic woman
by the name Gro Svendsen.

992
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:52,725
Very well...

993
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:54,767
And that's little Sours.

994
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:56,272
She's only a girl.

995
01:44:56,292 --> 01:44:57,653
Why has she even have a doll.

996
01:44:57,792 --> 01:45:01,329
She had three little children, lost them
all to the diphtheria in three days.

997
01:45:02,042 --> 01:45:02,994
Dear Lord!

998
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:05,122
please don't say anymore.

999
01:45:07,709 --> 01:45:09,614
There are letters for all three
of 'em in this bag here...

1000
01:45:10,792 --> 01:45:12,629
about their kin folks and all.

1001
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:14,044
I better move on.

1002
01:45:17,292 --> 01:45:19,673
They just might jump up and follow me.

1003
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,337
Ah! I think this room would hold them.

1004
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:26,894
Oh! I almost forgot...

1005
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:34,427
This is for you, Ms Sours.

1006
01:45:35,792 --> 01:45:37,221
It's lovely.

1007
01:45:37,917 --> 01:45:38,937
Maybe you want it,

1008
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:41,419
One fine day.

1009
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:52,838
Well goodbye, ladies.

1010
01:45:57,042 --> 01:45:57,994
God bless you.

1011
01:46:15,917 --> 01:46:17,559
They be alright.

1012
01:46:17,584 --> 01:46:18,877
I want to say goodbye to you.

1013
01:46:19,417 --> 01:46:21,662
You can give this wagon and those mules

1014
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:24,934
and that plaid horse and everything
else to the Methodist Women...

1015
01:46:24,959 --> 01:46:29,593
maybe they can sell their thing, use it for railroad fare and whatever else.

1016
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:34,435
Mr.Briggs! I'm delighted.

1017
01:46:34,542 --> 01:46:36,175
How very generous of you.

1018
01:46:36,584 --> 01:46:39,645
Tell the Reverend to give
a good feeding of corn.

1019
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:41,099
Will you go back to the territory?

1020
01:46:41,667 --> 01:46:42,619
I do not know.

1021
01:46:42,959 --> 01:46:45,680
If you do, please thank
Reverend Dowd for me.

1022
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:47,000
And wish him well

1023
01:46:47,125 --> 01:46:48,962
Yes, ma'am.

1024
01:46:49,584 --> 01:46:50,084
Well then.

1025
01:46:51,542 --> 01:46:53,719
This is our goodbye, Mr.Briggs.
Give your hand.

1026
01:46:55,834 --> 01:46:59,644
God Our Father, bless this
good man, wherever he may go.

1027
01:47:00,042 --> 01:47:01,062
keep watch over him.

1028
01:47:01,917 --> 01:47:03,822
Cause thy face to shine upon him

1029
01:47:04,875 --> 01:47:07,120
and bring him home to Thee one day.

1030
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:11,604
In Jesus name I pray, amen.

1031
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:15,603
I hope we meet again, Mr.Briggs
Goodbye.

1032
01:47:17,959 --> 01:47:19,183
You can go on now.

1033
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:08,838
Oh yes.

1034
01:48:09,417 --> 01:48:10,982
Looks better, sir.

1035
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:35,031
How old were you?

1036
01:48:35,209 --> 01:48:36,709
16.

1037
01:48:37,209 --> 01:48:39,318
You ain't got no shoes on your feet...

1038
01:48:40,292 --> 01:48:42,401
Well that's my business ain't?

1039
01:49:02,334 --> 01:49:03,627
I'll take them shoes, right there.

1040
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:43,243
Playing high stakes, sir.
You show us $50?

1041
01:49:43,542 --> 01:49:44,358
Here's $300 for you.

1042
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:47,691
Mind if I look?

1043
01:49:48,209 --> 01:49:48,709
Suit yourself.

1044
01:49:55,709 --> 01:49:57,138
Have a look at this, Mr.Carmichael.

1045
01:50:07,209 --> 01:50:08,502
"Bank of Loup"?

1046
01:50:08,792 --> 01:50:09,744
Right near Wamego.

1047
01:50:10,584 --> 01:50:11,945
How long since you been there,sir?

1048
01:50:12,584 --> 01:50:13,740
5, 6 weeks.

1049
01:50:14,375 --> 01:50:17,725
Bank of Loup went bust.
Happens all the time to...

1050
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:20,335
South buster banks in the territory.

1051
01:50:20,375 --> 01:50:24,389
I've lost more than my fair
share of wild cat paper.

1052
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:26,629
You have any greenbacks?

1053
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:27,250
No...

1054
01:50:28,209 --> 01:50:29,774
I spent it all.

1055
01:50:30,459 --> 01:50:33,452
I'm sorry, sir.
I cannot accept these banknotes.

1056
01:50:34,334 --> 01:50:35,354
Nobody around here, will.

1057
01:50:37,042 --> 01:50:39,287
Sorry, you can't sit around this
table unless you are playing.

1058
01:50:40,042 --> 01:50:41,879
I have to ask you to leave.

1059
01:50:42,167 --> 01:50:42,667
What?

1060
01:50:44,625 --> 01:50:46,190
Please leave the table, sir.

1061
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:53,311
You are not socially acceptable here.
See? 

1062
01:51:11,167 --> 01:51:13,820
You ever know a woman by
the name Mary Bee Cuddy?

1063
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:15,169
No, sir.

1064
01:51:16,542 --> 01:51:17,766
These are for you.

1065
01:51:27,167 --> 01:51:28,767
You still gotta pay your bill.

1066
01:51:28,792 --> 01:51:31,717
Them gravy and biscuits you
made were pretty good.

1067
01:51:32,459 --> 01:51:33,139
Thank you.

1068
01:51:34,167 --> 01:51:36,752
I gotta good piece of advice for you.

1069
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:41,184
When you get grown, don't marry
some shitty old headed kid....

1070
01:51:41,209 --> 01:51:44,475
headed West and lying claim on a
farm that he ain't gonna build yet.

1071
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,520
Don't do that.

1072
01:51:45,667 --> 01:51:46,347
You stay here.

01:51:47,959 --> 01:51:48,459
Why?

1074
01:51:49,125 --> 01:51:50,758
Because I told you to.

1075
01:51:51,834 --> 01:51:53,331
Who is Mary Bee Cuddy?

1076
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:55,031
Mary Bee Cuddy...

1077
01:51:56,542 --> 01:51:58,855
was a fine a woman ever walked.

1078
01:52:02,042 --> 01:52:03,403
You will never know her.

1079
01:52:04,209 --> 01:52:04,753
Well then so what?

Expect I am.

1086
01:52:28,042 --> 01:52:29,266
Why don't we marry?

Maybe...

1088
01:53:07,834 --> 01:53:08,446
All ways!
