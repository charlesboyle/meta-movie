2
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,541
Come on, go, go, go.

3
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,277
Move, move, move.

4
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:51,844
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

5
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,264
<i>Cease fire!
Hold your fire!</i>

6
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,352
<i>Go!</i>

7
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,938
Hunting.

8
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,773
I am going hunting.

9
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,127
Ow.

10
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,393
<i>Another day
and another round of violence</i>

11
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,228
<i>in Syria on Saturday.</i>

12
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,164
<i>Fighting in the northern city
of Atma has raged for days</i>

13
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,134
<i>causing widespread destruction
and casualties that have now</i>

14
00:08:56,136 --> 00:09:00,138
<i>topped 35,000,
with many of those civilians.</i>

15
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,173
<i>The addition of more troops
in what are sure to be</i>

16
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,110
<i>even bloodier battles ahead
has fueled worries</i>

17
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:09,147
<i>within the rebel ranks
and around the world.</i>

18
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,450
Talks in Washington calling
for the arming of insurgents

19
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,419
<i>in Syria.</i>

20
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,922
<i>We should start
considering all options,</i>

21
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,124
<i>including arming
the opposition.</i>

22
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,560
<i>Experts say arming
the fighting groups</i>

23
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,228
<i>among the opposition
is a sure way</i>

24
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,698
to drag the country
into a protracted civil war.

25
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,833
<i>It will also
further marginalize</i>

26
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,870
those in the opposition who
have advocated non-violence

27
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,039
<i>or to advance
political strategy.</i>

28
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,916
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

29
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,585
<i>Hey, Dad, it's Chris.
Did you get him?</i>

30
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,488
<i>No, I got the machine.
Why don't you try his cell?</i>

31
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,458
<i>'Cause he doesn't have a cell.
You could email him.</i>

32
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,960
<i>Or a computer.</i>

33
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,596
<i>So I'll just leave a message...</i>

34
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,565
Hey, buddy.
How's it going?

35
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,868
Hey. It's good.
It's great.

36
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,871
How about you? You been
radio silent for a while.

37
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,307
Just, you know,
keeping busy.

38
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,976
As usual.

39
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,511
So, hey, listen.

40
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,313
I don't know
if you saw the invite,

41
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,582
but tomorrow's
Matthew's baptism.

42
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,684
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,786
Starting him early, huh?
What's that?

44
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,556
Nothing.
Just, yeah, that's great.

45
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,258
That'll be a great day.

46
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,663
You know, we were hoping you
were going to make it down.

47
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:16,034
To be honest,
it's tough for me tomorrow.

48
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,970
Come on, Dad.
What do you got going on?

49
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,273
<i>Just, you know, odds and ends.</i>

50
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,776
Look, if it's
the church thing,

51
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,644
you could just come
to the party afterwards.

52
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,113
You don't even
have to wear a tie.

53
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,481
That sweetens the deal.

54
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,786
He coming?

55
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:38,022
Yeah, Dad.
He's going to be there.

56
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,391
Mom's been married
to the guy for 20 years,

57
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,794
you've said about as many
words to him. Yeah, well...

58
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,097
Look, like I said, son...

59
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,201
things have been keeping me
a little busy up here.

60
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,007
Right. Well...

61
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:00,678
Wort bug you about it anymore.
You're not bugging me.

62
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,114
No, you're not bugging me.

63
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,017
Well, hey, maybe we'll drive
up sometime, surprise you.

64
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,255
Yeah, well, better call first.

65
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,323
Right.

66
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,526
Okay. Well...

67
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,994
Leave you to it.

68
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,998
Goodbye, Dad.

69
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,233
Bye, Chris.

70
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,371
Bye.

71
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,715
Ah...

72
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,052
Fuck!

73
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,269
Shit.

74
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,327
Oh.

75
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,529
God damn.

76
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,030
Oh, shit.

77
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,536
Ah, shit.

78
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,420
<i>You got engine trouble?</i>

79
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,426
Long way from home, aren't you?
Well, that is the whole idea.

80
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,096
I am on sabbatical
for my health.

81
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,900
Yeah, well,
good luck on that.

82
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,168
May I take a look? I
got it covered, thanks.

83
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,703
It's no trouble.

84
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,439
I just have
to tow it into town.

85
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,408
But that is
30, 40 miles, no?

86
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,645
Please allow me. I drove
hack in London for seven years

87
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,181
and I had no choice but to become
expert on British automobiles.

88
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,217
Really, I don't need any help.
Thank you.

89
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,052
Okay. Okay.

90
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:27,792
Hey.

91
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,395
Sir.

92
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,799
I just...

93
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,569
I get this shooting pain in my leg.

94
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,904
Comes and goes.

95
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,173
Always puts me in a bad mood.

96
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,181
Try it.

97
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,220
Ah, you got to be
kidding me. God damn it!

98
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,891
Patience.
I'm trying to revive car.

99
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,659
I don't want to have
to do the same for you.

100
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,829
Well, I should've
just towed it in.

101
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,297
Okay, once more,
if you please.

102
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,069
Yeah.

103
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,537
Ah.

104
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,073
Well...

105
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:18,309
You're a miracle worker.
Thank you.

106
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,348
Body of Christ visited
in the filter housing.

107
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,350
I don't like American cars,
very finicky.

108
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,353
You have to be extremely
vigilant about maintenance.

109
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,855
You have to listen
to every little thing.

110
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,957
The shooting pain in my
leg is just killing me.

111
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,259
I just got to get...
Okay. My sermon is over.

112
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,895
Drug store will be closed
if I don't head out soon.

113
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,797
Appreciate the help, mister?

114
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,999
Emil Kovac.

115
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,701
Ben.
Benjamin Ford.

116
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,236
Take it easy.

117
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,270
You, too.

118
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,573
Take it easy.

119
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,660
You sure you're all right out here?

120
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:46,064
Where I come from, this is a
walk in the park. Where is that?

121
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm sure you would not
have heard of this place.

122
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,702
I'm...
just leave it at that.

123
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,337
Try me.

124
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,606
Small village, Lukomir.
Oh, yeah, Bosnia.

125
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,109
I was stationed in Bradina.

126
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,345
Yeah. Well, then, we are brothers.

127
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,413
I don't know about that.

128
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,749
I mean in arms.

129
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,918
Let me shake your hand again.

130
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,187
Yeah, small world.

131
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,355
I have kept you long.
That's okay.

132
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,691
The clock is ticking. It's too
dangerous to be driving anyway.

133
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,027
I think I'm going to head back.
I'm going to ride it out.

134
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,496
You're welcome
to join me if you want.

135
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,499
But I would hate to be bother. I could
lie to you, say it's the Christian in me

136
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,135
who wants you along, but truth
is if anything happens to you,

137
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,737
it's going to come back
and bite me in the ass.

138
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,739
There's a word for it.

139
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,641
I believe it is karma.

140
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,357
Few more minutes.

141
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,093
Winchester, no?

142
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,996
1873, the gun
that won the West.

143
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,531
Yeah, you hunter like me.

144
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,067
Yeah, every now and then.

145
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,636
I don't use that.

146
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,904
I use this.

147
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,976
Evens the odds
a little bit.

148
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,944
I wholeheartedly agree.

149
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,448
You know,
I must confess,

150
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,383
I did not come halfway
around the world

151
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,886
just for mountain air.

152
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,054
I came for trophy.
Oh, whitetail?

153
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:21,759
Elk. Elk, they gave
you a tag, lucky dog.

154
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,495
What'd you do, pull some
strings with Fish and Wildlife?

155
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,833
No patience. You know, 18
months ago I applied for license

156
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,968
for five bull.

157
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,871
Perhaps you come
with me tomorrow.

158
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,540
No, really.

159
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:39,243
The storm will be over
and the air will be clear

160
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,312
and maybe, who knows,
you get lucky,

161
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,481
you add another head
to your collection.

162
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,716
Well, what are you using?
I use this.

163
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,717
I'll show you.

164
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,760
Here.
Jesus Christ, buddy.

165
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,361
You fight
in the Indian Wars?

166
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,565
No, this is the same bow
I used as a boy.

167
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:05,002
You know, it's, gets
very clean strong draw.

168
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,141
Not jerky like yours.
Well, mine won't snap.

169
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,444
Any bow can snap.
That's fiberglass.

170
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,646
I worked with fiberglass
in factory.

171
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:19,383
That was after the war? No, before
the war. Old soldier like you.

172
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,619
But sometimes
it is difficult

173
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,022
to know when to leave
the battlefield, you know?

174
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,993
You're talking
about the fiberglass.

175
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:33,164
The tiny beer bubbles
find their way into the malt

176
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,000
during
the manufacturing process.

177
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:39,103
And then each time
you pull the string back,

178
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,139
the fiberglass
weakens bit by bit.

179
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,743
One day, you are tracking
your quarry through the grass,

180
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:50,381
and the rocks, and the mud,
and the rain, and the snow,

181
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,383
and finally
you see your prize bull

182
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:55,019
right in the sights
and snap!

183
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,520
It breaks.

184
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,058
You're a weird duck.

185
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,627
Hmm.

186
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,164
What is this photographer?

187
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,201
Oh, I did those.
Really?

188
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,402
You're a photographer?

189
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,337
Yeah.

190
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,074
What is this one? Well, that's
the old church up in God's Peak.

191
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,944
God's Peak.
Hmm.

192
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,212
Reminds me of home.

193
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,816
Oh, no, please, I'm fine.
Oh, you got to try it.

194
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:30,054
I have more than I need,
and it doesn't keep real well.

195
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,756
Or not.
It's a free country.

196
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:32,590
Okay.

197
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,192
If you insist.

198
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,545
This is good. Good, huh? Told you.

199
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,347
It's delicious.

200
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,984
Oh. It almost
slipped my mind.

201
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,719
<i>I have something
to return the favor.</i>

202
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,529
For the true hunter.

203
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,165
It's too late for me now.
Oh, come on.

204
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,601
You know, you did not
have aspirin today, okay?

205
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,237
So, do not think
of it as a drink.

206
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:24,141
Think of it
as pain killer.

207
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,078
I always drink
with friend.

208
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,412
Never alone.

209
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,182
I have many rules,
most I break.

210
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,250
But never that one.

211
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:36,987
<i>So, Zivjeli.
Live long.</i>

212
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,356
Zivjeli.

213
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,661
<i>I'm telling you,
these women are beautiful.</i>

214
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:47,064
They fuck all night,
I'm not kidding you.

215
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:51,168
Okay, now, your turn.
You tell me stories.

216
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,404
War stories. I want to
hear this. War stories?

217
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,740
Yes. Most of those aren't true.

218
00:22:55,742 --> 00:23:00,010
Most, but some. Ones that are, why
would anyone want to talk about it?

219
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,546
How else do you
keep the best life?

220
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,515
The past is dead.
Let's keep it that way.

221
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:08,152
No, see, now I see the
difference between you and me.

222
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,755
You drink
to forget the past,

223
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,023
I drink to remember.

224
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:16,761
I don't remember much,
but this I do remember.

225
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,266
The more booze
you brought over there,

226
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,535
there was plenty of blood.

227
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:25,770
To the war.

228
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,475
Oh, come on, Benjamin.

229
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:35,045
Is there not anything
you missed about the war?

230
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,147
Only to not miss it.

231
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:37,681
But why you say this?

232
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,917
It was nothing but like
cakewalk for you, no?

233
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,687
You don't have any idea what
the war was like for me, buddy.

234
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,127
I misspoke. What I simply meant
is that most American soldiers

235
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,230
did nothing more
but lob missiles into Bosnia

236
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:56,567
from the safety of ships
floating in the Mediterranean.

237
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,601
Most, not all.

238
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,378
Three drinks.
Say again?

239
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,581
My people say
we love Americans

240
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,984
for three drinks,
but we've had five.

241
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,687
And I still love you.

242
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,155
Hey. Come on.

243
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,825
<i>Let's have six.
Maybe seven.</i>

244
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,694
Two more, we'll forget
we even had this conversation.

245
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,101
<i>¶ Then Billy Joe reached
for his gun to draw ¶</i>

246
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:36,674
¶ But the stranger drew his gun
and fired before he even saw ¶

247
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,577
¶ As Billy Joe
fell to the floor ¶

248
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,079
¶ the crowd
all gathered round ¶

249
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:46,383
¶ And wondered
at his final words ¶

250
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:50,588
¶ Don't take your guns
to town, son ¶

251
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,058
¶ Leave your guns
at home, Bill ¶

252
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,697
¶ Don't take your guns to town

253
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:00,965
To the man in black.

254
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,970
Love this fucking song.

255
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,409
What?
The shooting pain?

256
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,079
Shrapnel,
finding its way out.

257
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,882
Why don't you
just get this removed?

258
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,918
Well, doctor says my choice.

259
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,287
I hate hospitals anyway.

260
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,822
Maybe you like pain.

261
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,960
Sometimes things
become part of you.

262
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,729
Whether you like it or not.

263
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,639
What is this?
Is this a picture of baby?

264
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:46,210
My grandson gets
baptized tomorrow morning.

265
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,078
I don't think
I'm going to make it.

266
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,747
I haven't even met the kid yet.

267
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,583
Yeah, but, you know,
he sent this invitation,

268
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,385
I'm sure
he wants you to go.

269
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,655
Well, my wife,
well, my ex-wife,

270
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:00,991
she's going to bring her
new... hell, I say new,

271
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:04,929
but she's been married,
what, going on 20 years now.

272
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:08,866
And you know the kicker?
Kicker? What's "kicker?"

273
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,801
<i>Surprise.
Surprise, yes.</i>

274
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:15,005
The new guy, he was
best man at our wedding.

275
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:19,109
Oh, mother fucker.
You're kidding.

276
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,711
Yup.

277
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,580
He's all right.
He ain't a bad guy.

278
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,616
He's been there for my son.

279
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:28,285
He's been actually more
of a father than I have.

280
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:33,424
I've been, you know,
away and here and there.

281
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,025
You know, just...

282
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,697
<i>Oh, come on, Ben.</i>

283
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:44,802
Let me read something for you.
You test my German. Okay.

284
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:48,272
It is the hunter's honor
that he protects

285
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:52,309
and preserves his game,
hunts sportsmanlike,

286
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:57,281
and honors the creator
and his creatures.

287
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:05,389
Benjamin, did you honor
the creator in him?

288
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,691
I didn't kill him.
You didn't?

289
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,594
I haven't killed anything
in 20 years. You're joking.

290
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:15,366
No. Everything you see here inside, outside,
all bullshit. Bullshit, what do you mean...

291
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:16,867
Everything here,
bullshit car,

292
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,503
bullshit house,
bullshit fiberglass bow,

293
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:23,674
bullshit heads on a wall, it's all
bullshit. Come on, I would love to have this.

294
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,643
Want to hear
something pathetic?

295
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,312
This was all here when I bought
this place. You're joking.

296
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:32,516
No. Furnished with rustic interior
design elements. Oh, my God.

297
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:37,087
That's what the listing said. That's it. It's
all bullshit. That is not the man you are.

298
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,990
I mean I grew up in a place
like this, but not as big

299
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,993
and actually not as fancy,
but it was, you know,

300
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:47,264
it was the real deal, mountains,
trees, hung out with my dad.

301
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,868
Hey, I'll show you something.
You'll get a kick out of this.

302
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,776
That was my dad's.
What is this?

303
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:01,912
Silver star
for gallantry in action.

304
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:05,115
But does he have some war
stories to tell, huh? Oh, yeah.

305
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:08,252
I fought three different wars,
four different countries,

306
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,320
still couldn't get
one of these.

307
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,789
Really?

308
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:16,060
No prize for Ben.
That's not good.

309
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,396
All the good things you did,
you know, why not...

310
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:22,266
I remember the first time
we went hunting,

311
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,201
I told him
I wanted to use his bow.

312
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,172
He said, "You're not strong
enough to draw the string back. "

313
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,808
He taught you
how to use this bow.

314
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,776
Yeah, he taught me how to
make a bow. Oh, make a bow.

315
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:36,080
He could do anything with his
hands. Oh, yeah, he was... Whoa.

316
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,581
He could do it all.

317
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,183
I hit something
the first time out,

318
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,852
medium sized bow,
right in the heart.

319
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,654
"Eagle eye," that's
what my dad called me.

320
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:46,890
Ah, Eagle eye.
Yeah.

321
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,663
Okay, you know...

322
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:57,201
It's time for me to be
roughing it again. Are you sure?

323
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:04,608
I've got a spare room in the back... No, you
have been very kind, you've been very generous.

324
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,879
My offer still stands,
tomorrow at dawn,

325
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:12,382
the west fork,
and I'll tell you what.

326
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,619
I even give you the first
shot. I appreciate it.

327
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:19,323
I got lots of things to do
tomorrow. Nice to have you over.

328
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:21,058
You get good sleep.
You think about it.

329
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,493
Maybe you change
your mind.

330
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,328
My thanks to you.
Thank you.

331
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,264
Okay. Goodnight,
Benjamin. You too, you too.

332
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,401
Have a good sleep.
You too, Emil.

333
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,959
Careful, it's slippery.

334
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,229
So, how do you feel?

335
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,098
Got a hangover,
bouncing back.

336
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,466
Not so much for me.

337
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,302
You're used to it,
I'm sure.

338
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,472
Mountainman, Davy Crockett.
You know that?

339
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,107
I do.
You heard over there?

340
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:13,510
As a boy.
You are Davy Crockett.

341
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:17,714
I never go this way.
Mountainmen.

342
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,520
You go up
in the meadow over there.

343
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,389
I've had good luck there.

344
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,826
I'm going up to the deer stand.
Take this.

345
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:32,896
It's voice activated. Channel
three. Put it on channel three.

346
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,933
Testing. Testing.
One, two. One, two.

347
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,634
It's good stuff.

348
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,136
Testing. Testing.

349
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,444
Did you ever hear the one
about this old Italian guy

350
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:50,147
wants to confess
to local padre?

351
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:52,482
So he slides open the little
door in the confessional.

352
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:55,419
He says, "Father, forgive
me for I have sinned.

353
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,788
"Back during the war, there
was this beautiful woman.

354
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,391
"She came to my house and asked
me to protect her from the Nazis.

355
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,727
"So I hid her up my attic. "

356
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,697
The priest says, "That's a
wonderful thing you did, my son.

357
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,966
"There's no need to confess. "

358
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,301
And the old man says,
"But it gets worse.

359
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:16,273
"She started to repay me with
sexual favors like blowjobs. "

360
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:26,583
So the priest says, "Fear not, my
son, war makes sinners of us all.

361
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,752
"You are forgiven. "
The old man says,

362
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:33,957
"Well, that's a great burden
off my mind. A great burden.

363
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:38,095
<i>"But I have one more
question. " Do you see him?</i>

364
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,597
<i>Do you have a shot?</i>

365
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,203
Yeah, I'll try.

366
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,412
<i>Take him.</i>

367
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,548
<i>He's nothing
but a bag of meat</i>

368
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,919
<i>and flesh and tendon.</i>

369
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,623
<i>Put him out
of his misery.</i>

370
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,896
<i>Take the shot,
Eagle Eye.</i>

371
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:20,504
You want him, he's yours.

372
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:21,672
<i>I know.</i>

373
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,742
What the hell was that?

374
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,678
You just spooked him.

375
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:34,151
<i>Colonel Ford,
you've changed.</i>

376
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,853
Kovac?

377
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,823
<i>You pulled the trigger
back in Menacha.</i>

378
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,760
How'd you know
I was in Menacha?

379
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,996
<i>Because I was there, too.</i>

380
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,200
Fuck.

381
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,949
<i>It's the hunter's honor
that he protects</i>

382
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,086
<i>and preserves his game,
hunts sportsmanlike,</i>

383
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,455
<i>and honors
the creator's creatures.</i>

384
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:14,925
You're not Bosnian. What
the fuck do you want from me?

385
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:17,461
I always wonder who would
win in a fair fight,

386
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:21,098
both of us properly armed.
Fuck!

387
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,835
<i>Two men alone
in the wilderness.</i>

388
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:25,369
War.

389
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,005
Distilled.

390
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,707
My bow is broken.
This ain't a fair fight.

391
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,343
<i>You of all people
should know,</i>

392
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,945
<i>war is not fair.</i>

393
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:11,348
Fuck!

394
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,829
Fuck.

395
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,235
I told you,
I wanted a trophy.

396
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,204
Fuck you!
Ah.

397
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:50,373
I warned you
about the air bubbles

398
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,211
in the fiberglass, first
sign of trouble, and snap!

399
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,314
What, you pissed off about the war or
something? Did something happen to you?

400
00:36:57,316 --> 00:37:00,283
You killed my friend, I killed
your friend, that's what it's about.

401
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,553
I made peace with my
sins. It's over. No.

402
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:07,924
The war will never be over. Why
don't you just shoot me, then?

403
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:10,827
Instead of this running around
hiding bullshit. Just shoot me!

404
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,762
Oh, come on, Benjamin.

405
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:18,001
I just want
to shoot the shit.

406
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,070
Shoot the shit? Yeah, it's
how you say this, right?

407
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,639
Shoot the shit. Shoot the
shit? You just shot me.

408
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:26,243
What the fuck are you... I know,
but I had to. I had no choice.

409
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:29,646
I could've shot you in the
heart or the head, but I didn't.

410
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:32,082
I could've killed you.

411
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,985
So, come out to sit.
We'll talk like gentlemen.

412
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,161
Come on, sit over here.

413
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,096
Sit down.

414
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,539
<i>Benjamin.</i>

415
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,144
What are you,
you going to hang me now?

416
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,581
Pull up your pants leg.

417
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,159
<i>There's a stake
on the end of that rope.</i>

418
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:19,029
I want you to put it through the
hole in your leg and tie it. What?

419
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,231
Put the stake through
the hole in the calf.

420
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,306
<i>Okay.</i>

421
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:30,607
Let me see!

422
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,068
Tie it, please.

423
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,245
Tight.

424
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,762
Don't worry.

425
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,964
The calf muscle is very strong.

426
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:32,469
You can hang like this for days
without tearing muscle.

427
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:36,206
Okay, you are the old
Italian man. I am the priest.

428
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,575
And this is our confession.

429
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,810
So, what are your sins, my son?

430
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:45,548
And you say something like, "Oh,
bless me, father, for I have sinned.

431
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,753
"It's been so and so many days since my
last confession, and these are my sins. "

432
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:53,056
Now, you know what that means
to confess, no? Of course you do.

433
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,926
But, you, you say things like,
"Oh, my wife left me.

434
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,963
"Oh, my son calls
different man 'father. '

435
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,198
"Oh, I miss my dear old daddy. "

436
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,770
But I go to confession every
week, even more if I find the time.

437
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,172
But you go to retreat
in the mountain,

438
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:12,475
did you think you could forget
the past? What do you want from me?

439
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,177
I want real confession!

440
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:17,914
You put bullet in my back
and you left me for dead.

441
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,917
And now for years
you run from the truth.

442
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,854
And I carried the pain alone.
But no more!

443
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:27,657
So, now it is time
to spill your guts.

444
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,961
Now, you know American Indians
spilled one's guts to reveal

445
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,731
one's most intimate secrets.

446
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:38,735
I want you
to spill your guts to me.

447
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:41,971
Or I will spill them for you.

448
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,507
Want good cut?

449
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:48,077
Like this, and everything spills
out on the ground. Please, stop.

450
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,847
You live alone. This is good,
because I want you to see

451
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:55,385
all the little creatures will come
down and nibble on your insides.

452
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,612
<i>You'll be late.</i>

453
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:18,554
Looks like you missed
your little nephew's baptism.

454
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:23,292
<i>But you would rather be up
here with me, wouldn't you?</i>

455
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,664
Do you believe
in God, Benjamin?

456
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:30,333
Who gives a shit?

457
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,802
Did you hear what I said?
Fuck you.

458
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,674
<i>I believe in him.</i>

459
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,076
I know he exists.

460
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:41,444
And I'll tell you why.

461
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,517
It was walking home
from the factory in Lukomir.

462
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,554
<i>And I see a crowd of people
in town square.</i>

463
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:55,625
<i>The soldiers were dragging
Serbs from their houses.</i>

464
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:59,262
<i>They raped
my mother, my sister,</i>

465
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:02,532
and they poured petrol
all over the wounded bodies.

466
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:07,837
<i>The men,
they were not so lucky.</i>

467
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,709
<i>They used the axes to split their
heads open and let them die in square.</i>

468
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:15,712
<i>And I asked myself,
if God truly exists,</i>

469
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:18,214
<i>how could he allow
such terrible things?</i>

470
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,683
Then I think all the things
that happened in my life

471
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:24,187
and I realized that is not
the proof of the absence of God,

472
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:26,589
this is the proof
of his existence.

473
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:31,594
Because men alone could not be
capable of such magnificent evil.

474
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,570
Now, I spilled my guts.

475
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:41,537
Your turn.

476
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,640
Your turn!

477
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,410
Your turn!

478
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:05,228
Maybe I'm coming in
more clear now, eh?

479
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,750
Dad?

480
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,254
Dad, you around?

481
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,564
Come on, Dad.

482
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:43,766
Is he here?

483
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,703
There's his car.
He might be asleep.

484
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,517
It's okay.

485
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,354
<i>Dad?</i>

486
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,062
Maybe he doesn't
want to see us.

487
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:17,266
Which is exactly why
we should have called.

488
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,902
Leave it up to my dad
not to be around.

489
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:41,624
<i>Benjamin.</i>

490
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,066
<i>Be quiet, don't move.</i>

491
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:53,569
Hey, at least we have a three hour
car ride home to look forward to.

492
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:58,107
At least he's asleep.
Oh. Hi, but he's awake.

493
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:00,409
You want this baby
to have a father or no?

494
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,578
Let's play. Put that fucking bow down.

495
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,081
Otherwise, I have to put
one more head on your wall.

496
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:07,683
That's my family, goddammit.
You threaten my family,

497
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:10,720
I will end you,
mother fucker, you hear me?

498
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:16,025
Put that fucking bow down.
I can't hold it much longer.

499
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:19,462
You wanna play? You
want your war, goddammit?

500
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:22,832
Yeah. Yeah.
We can play.

501
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,070
You want your war?

502
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,305
Come and get it.

503
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:31,841
I'll give you a head start.

504
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,563
It is Murphy's Law, no?

505
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:58,701
Whatever can go wrong
will go wrong.

506
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,043
Bullshit cabin.

507
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:08,778
Bullshit wine.

508
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,551
<i>Hey.</i>

509
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,288
It's okay.
It's okay.

510
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,490
Hold still. Hold still. Let me see.

511
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,264
Let me see your tongue.

512
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,133
Oh, there it is.

513
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,602
Yeah, you'll still
be able to talk.

514
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:10,606
That's good, 'cause I know
how much you like to talk.

515
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:14,410
Yeah. I know it hurts, but
it's okay. Very superficial.

516
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:16,512
Yeah, let me help you.

517
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,426
Getting that removed.
Risky.

518
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:04,960
You proud of what you did?

519
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,631
Or maybe
you don't want to forget.

520
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:11,667
It's like
with your shot.

521
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:14,537
Sometimes things
become part of you,

522
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:16,972
whether you want it to
or not.

523
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:23,746
Scorpions, Serbian death squad, tried
for war crimes against Bosnian Muslims.

524
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,282
Some did terrible things.

525
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:31,220
Some were simply caught up in
circumstances beyond their control.

526
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:32,588
Yeah, which one were you?

527
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,992
You know, I got an idea.

528
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:46,168
I think this time you should be the
old Italian guy, I should be the priest.

529
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,971
Not talking anymore?

530
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,641
Not giving me any
long dissertations

531
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:55,644
<i>on the meaning
of war and life?</i>

532
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:59,381
I'll give you
a very simple one.

533
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,584
When life gives you lemons...

534
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:02,751
that's right.

535
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,956
Nice and simple.

536
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:15,564
And my mother, she used to
always have a fresh pitcher

537
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:19,101
waiting for us when Dad and
me came out of the woods.

538
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:23,706
One morning we went hunting
and I got one in the chest.

539
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,808
But I missed the heart.

540
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:31,113
Probably punctured his lungs,
so we had to chase him down.

541
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:32,181
Like the bowl?

542
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,618
Yeah, me too.

543
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,686
More natural this way.

544
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,323
So, anyway...

545
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,459
we finally caught up.

546
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,728
He made me put that
knife in his throat.

547
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,097
Made me watch
while it bled out.

548
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:51,667
Got to do it quick, he said,
otherwise the meat will spoil.

549
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,036
You know, you wouldn't think
it, but even in an animal

550
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:58,674
you can see that exact moment
when the light leaves its eyes.

551
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,878
Almost done.

552
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,322
Damn.

553
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:15,191
No sugar.

554
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:21,897
I'm just going to
have to substitute.

555
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,139
This ought to do.

556
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,043
Well, now.

557
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:17,152
You think a little bit of pain
is going to make me break?

558
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:18,420
I sure don't know.

559
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,955
What if I like pain?

560
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,094
This might be your lucky day.

561
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,801
Here we go.

562
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,346
Want another?

563
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:45,180
Yes, please.

564
00:54:52,122 --> 00:55:00,963
You like that, huh? How's it feel
to be the one getting tortured?

565
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,832
Is that what you did during
the war? Torture people?

566
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,702
Huh? Tell me. What?

567
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:08,404
What'd you do?

568
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:09,571
Who'd you kill?

569
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:11,040
Bosnians?
Croatians?

570
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:13,409
Women? Children? Who'd you kill?

571
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,878
No children. No women.
What, then? What did you do?

572
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,180
What'd you do?
I made tools.

573
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:21,517
What for? What were they
used for? Many things.

574
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,155
For sleeping tent
and shredding muscles.

575
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:32,728
The goal was to make people talk
and at the end, everyone talks.

576
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,197
You like tools, huh?

577
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,966
I got tools, too.

578
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,869
Don't go anywhere.

579
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,250
See?

580
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,222
That's that thing
we were talking about.

581
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,124
That word.

582
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:02,391
Karma.

583
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,436
You torture me and I'll
torture you. Sound familiar?

584
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:17,473
The Serbs attacked the Bosnians
because the Bosnians attacked the Serbs.

585
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:22,044
Same goes for the Croatians and
the Nazis back in World War II.

586
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:25,848
Truth is, you can go back
1,000 years and still not know

587
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,817
how a conflict
really started.

588
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:32,421
But we all know how it ends.

589
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:36,592
You think you're the only one that
lost something in that war? Huh?

590
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,193
It destroyed me.

591
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,295
<i>You hear?</i>

592
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:42,998
You hear?

593
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:21,470
The war is almost over,
Colonel Ford.

594
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,276
For gallantry in action.

595
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,550
<i>Move!</i>

596
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,950
Can't move, eh?

597
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:10,419
I know this feeling.

598
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:12,621
For three years...

599
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:16,325
I had very much
the same feeling.

600
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:21,630
I was shot in the back and I
was paralyzed from the neck down.

601
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:23,765
And I could barely talk.

602
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:26,301
And you know
how much I like to talk.

603
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:34,810
And there was beautiful nurse.
Her name was Sophia.

604
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:40,883
She was always
dressed in white.

605
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:45,587
She always had beautiful
smile on her face.

606
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,724
I dreamed
making love to her,

607
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:50,759
fucking her.

608
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:55,197
You know
what her job was?

609
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,100
To collect
the piss and the shit

610
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:02,204
from the pan
from beneath my bed.

611
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:05,807
But slowly
the feeling came back.

612
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:08,677
You know, I taught myself how to write.

613
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,679
I taught myself
how to eat.

614
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:13,916
I taught myself
to speak again

615
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:19,054
and to walk like a man,
not like cripple.

616
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,890
I had no help. I had no
mother. I had no father.

617
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:26,895
I had no wife or child.

618
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,064
And you know
what kept me going?

619
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,803
Not knowing
if you would fight,

620
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:36,538
and if you did,
who would win.

621
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:41,443
Because you have been like
such a won'thy adversary.

622
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,671
You win.

623
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:52,240
I know.

624
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,143
Just get it over with.

625
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:57,312
Yeah, I promise.
But not yet.

626
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,347
Well, what are you
waiting for?

627
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:04,986
I'm waiting for your
confession, Colonel Ford.

628
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:24,573
Please, please stop.

629
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:27,676
Sit there. Sit there.

630
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:40,822
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

631
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:47,362
My country has beauty,
but there is an invisible layer

632
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:51,666
of blood caked over everything.

633
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:58,039
Most people cannot see it,
but I have special eyes.

634
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:01,143
Everywhere I look,
I see red.

635
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:10,018
Move!

636
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:19,394
A young cowboy, Billy Joe,
grew restless on the farm.

637
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:26,334
The boy filled with wanderlust,
he really meant no harm.

638
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:32,040
Billy Joe fell to the floor,
the crowd all gathered round

639
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:36,311
and wondered
at his final words,

640
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:41,249
"Don't take
your guns to town, son.

641
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:44,619
"Don't leave
your guns at home.

642
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:49,057
"We'll take your gun to town. "

643
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,594
Ah.

644
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:58,366
Is little Benny tired?

645
01:03:58,368 --> 01:03:59,501
Benjamin?

646
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,807
Benjamin.

647
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:37,419
The shooting pain again, eh?

648
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:41,790
Is it the shrapnel
trying to move its way out?

649
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:45,693
There it is. What if
I try to help it along?

650
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,903
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

651
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:57,539
Bless me,
but do not forgive me.

652
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,341
It has been one week
since my last confession.

653
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:04,145
It has been a big week and I could go
down the list, but there's short of time.

654
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:06,481
And of course
you have better things to do.

655
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,316
So, don't forgive us.
Okay.

656
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:13,621
I confess my sins onto you,
but do not dare absolve them.

657
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:19,494
I want to be part of them
for me to never forget them.

658
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:23,998
Okay, you. Your turn. You, you confess.

659
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,766
Now!

660
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:29,170
It is only
the three of us here.

661
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:33,208
You and me and him.

662
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:36,578
I will keep your secret,
Colonel Ford.

663
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,747
In the end
he's not even listening.

664
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,753
You are the only one
getting in the way of the truth.

665
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:52,227
I give up.

666
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,795
You win.

667
01:08:58,701 --> 01:08:59,901
<i>You win.</i>

668
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,304
But you lose.

669
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:15,750
Maybe you'll finally tell him the
truth when you see him face to face.

670
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,855
You want to kill me?

671
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:21,956
Look me in the eye.

672
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,875
<i>October.</i>

673
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,113
Like this, right?

674
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:21,849
'95.

675
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:27,422
<i>My unit was first on
the ground outside...</i>

676
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:31,893
We were tasked with liberating the Bosnian
Muslims from the internment camp there.

677
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,996
The first thing
we noticed was the smell.

678
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:37,232
Got our attention
right away.

679
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:41,102
<i>Like my father's
taxidermy shed.</i>

680
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:46,808
And when we got to the camp, we saw
boxcars sitting out on the tracks.

681
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:50,078
Looked like they were
full of old clothes.

682
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:56,951
We got closer, we began
to make out hands and legs.

683
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:58,820
<i>It was the faces.</i>

684
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:03,424
<i>Faces just skin
stretched over skulls.</i>

685
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,959
Bodies stuck together.

686
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:06,894
Stuck to the ground
from the frost,

687
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:10,064
eyelids frozen open
staring right at you.

688
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,204
Camp was run
by Serbians,

689
01:11:16,206 --> 01:11:19,073
called themselves
the Scorpions.

690
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:23,111
<i>Dozens of these Scorpions,
they surrendered.</i>

691
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,947
They were all going to go back
to a POW camp for a few weeks

692
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:29,717
and then after the war,
they'd all just go home.

693
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:33,988
I'd seen... we'd all seen
firsthand what they'd done,

694
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,691
the children
they butchered,

695
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:39,127
women they raped,
tortured.

696
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:45,166
<i>So we stripped them down, burned
their uniforms, marched them up a hill</i>

697
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:50,071
<i>in the middle of nowhere. And we got to
the top, my men lined the prisoners up</i>

698
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:54,175
<i>on their knees facing away.</i>

699
01:11:54,177 --> 01:11:56,511
I joined up
to make my father proud,

700
01:11:56,513 --> 01:12:02,483
but when I told him, he
tried to talk me out of it.

701
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,185
"Remember the elk,"
he said.

702
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:07,789
"Remember the look in
their eyes at the end.

703
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:10,591
"You see that happen to another
man, doesn't matter if he's a friend

704
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:15,263
"or an enemy. You see that
happen, it changes you forever. "

705
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,365
<i>Of course
I didn't believe him.</i>

706
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:19,033
<i>Had to find out
for myself.</i>

707
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:22,503
Should have listened.

708
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,489
I been...

709
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:44,726
I been in a lot of wars,
but never one like Bosnia.

710
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,731
<i>That war got into my head.</i>

711
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:52,333
<i>I saw it like a poison.</i>

712
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,013
<i>I just wanted it to stop.</i>

713
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:12,320
<i>I thought maybe killing a few of
the worst ones would make it go away.</i>

714
01:13:12,322 --> 01:13:14,021
<i>So I pulled the trigger.</i>

715
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:22,797
Just like that I became everything
I hated about that damn war.

716
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:24,699
Everything.

717
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:28,102
Then when I got home I couldn't
even look myself in the mirror

718
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:30,037
or my son in the eye.

719
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,046
Yeah, I figured he was
just better off without me.

720
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:46,154
Then I was not prepared
to die, but now...

721
01:13:46,156 --> 01:13:49,824
you should
pull the trigger.

722
01:13:49,826 --> 01:13:53,561
<i>Put an end to this for us.</i>

723
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:55,530
You can finish it.

724
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:02,170
Don't you know
the things I have done?

725
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:06,541
Don't I deserve to die?

726
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:09,410
We are both killers.

727
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:10,278
<i>Are we not?</i>

728
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,949
We're the same,
you and I.

729
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:23,958
He is nothing
but meat and flesh

730
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,995
and tendon, put him
out of his misery.

731
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,134
Please, God,
pull the trigger.

732
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:48,783
Pull the trigger!

733
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:47,375
So, this old Italian guy, he wants
to confess to the local priest.

734
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:50,611
He's getting on in age and
wants to make it right with God.

735
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:54,315
So, he tells the priest,
"Father, back in the war

736
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:56,551
"there was this beautiful
woman that came to my house

737
01:15:56,553 --> 01:16:00,521
"and asked me to protect
her from the Nazis,

738
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:02,557
<i>"so I hid her up
in my attic. "</i>

739
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:05,593
The priest says, "Well, that's a
wonderful thing you did, my son.

740
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:08,563
<i>"There's no reason
to confess. "</i>

741
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:11,532
The old man says, "But
it gets worse, Father.

742
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:14,168
"She started to repay
me with sexual favors,

743
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:17,939
"you know, like, blowjobs
and shit like that. "

744
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,148
The priest says,
"Well...

745
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,317
"you both are in great danger, my son.

746
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:31,385
"War makes sinners
of us all.

747
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:33,955
"So, you are forgiven. "

748
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:36,857
The old man says,
"Well, thank you, Father.

749
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:39,727
"It's a great burden
off my mind.

750
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:42,229
"But I have
one more question. "

751
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:45,166
"What's that, my son?"

752
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:48,336
"Should I have told her
that the war was over?"

753
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,646
I don't get it.

754
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:02,383
It's not that funny.

755
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:14,328
I believe I got something
that belongs to you.

756
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:18,833
Yeah.

757
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:25,172
He's got your eyes.

758
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,746
Maybe I'll see them
for myself.

759
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:05,339
Zivjeli.

760
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:15,850
<i>The war is only
just beginning.</i>

761
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:19,854
<i>Thousands are homeless and fleeing
the province as the war escalates.</i>

762
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:22,523
<i>Troops have made progress
in the province today,</i>

763
01:19:22,525 --> 01:19:25,860
<i>continuing a cavalcade
of intense aerial shelling</i>

764
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:27,762
<i>with no signs
of anyone stopping.</i>

765
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:30,397
<i>"It's like hell on earth,"
said one woman</i>

766
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,933
<i>when she fled with her three
children for the border.</i>

767
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,935
<i>It never ends.</i>

768
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:37,404
But for many of these now...

769
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:17,478
Hey.

770
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,981
Sorry I'm late.

771
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:34,695
Come on.

772
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:36,997
There's someone
I want you to meet.

773
01:20:38,998 --> 01:20:42,998
