1
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,406
So what, she's like your
girlfriend now or something?

2
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,411
No.

3
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,539
I don't know.

4
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,993
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

5
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,869
See that there?

6
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,496
That was fuckin' air time there.

7
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:01,831
Ready to learn, kid?

8
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:02,997
Yeah.

9
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,280
Here we go.

10
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,960
I like to go in slow
and deep, you know?

11
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:09,380
You know what I'm
talking about there?

12
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:10,747
Does that embarrass you there?

13
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Oh, yeah.

14
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,217
Ha, ha, ha, he is.

15
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,761
Look at you, you're
fuckin' embarrassed.

16
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:16,720
Are you blushing?

17
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,596
It's the way you say it.

18
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,222
You're blushing.

19
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,515
Holy shit.

20
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:20,266
Oh, yeah.

21
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:20,724
That's one.

22
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,517
Next one.

23
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:22,476
One hand.

24
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,185
One hand?

25
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,436
Oh, fuck me.

26
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,772
If you got to use two,
I'd fuckin' shoot you.

27
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,440
What's the... the next one?

28
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:36,607
250, 250.

29
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:44,957
Yeah.

30
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:45,457
That's fuckin' you right there.

31
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,250
Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:46,834
All fuckin' day.

33
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:47,376
Oh, yeah.

34
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:47,751
Casper.

35
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:48,918
<i>Oh...</i>

36
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,089
Casper.

37
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,008
What?

38
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:54,884
Did you get my text?

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,887
I've texted you like twice.

40
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,472
Uh, no.

41
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,849
Guess I didn't.

42
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,602
Must have been them Canadian
signals there, you know.

43
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,808
OK, let me see your phone.

44
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,270
What?

45
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:06,645
Relax.

46
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,812
Relax.

47
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:08,564
Fuck, man.

48
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:09,731
When...

49
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:10,524
I need to talk to you, OK?

50
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,401
Let's go outside.

51
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,029
Come on.

52
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:18,908
So why did the cow
cross the road?

53
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,274
I'm not in the mood, Casper,

54
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,687
He wanted to go
to the moo-vies.

55
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,208
My little sister
likes that one, so.

56
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,547
Where were you this morning?

57
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,090
What?

58
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:35,674
Why are you so...

59
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,219
I needed you.

60
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:38,969
OK?

61
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,473
And you... look.

62
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,437
Uh, I don't know how
to tell you this.

63
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,567
What?

64
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,403
Did someone die or something?

65
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,570
I'm pregnant.

66
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,617
I'm fucking pregnant.

67
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,008
God.

68
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,175
I need you, OK?

69
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,022
Can we make it work?

70
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,190
Will you make it work?

71
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,489
Uh.

72
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,656
Uh.

73
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,119
Do you love me?

74
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,210
Casper?

75
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,921
What?

76
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,214
Can we just then...

77
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,222
Sorry.

78
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,476
I'm not... I... we... just
don't apologize, you know?

79
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,771
Just my... just don't...
just don't worry about it.

80
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,315
Just give me some time.

81
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,274
I'll figure it out.

82
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,568
But don't worry about it, OK?

83
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:18,735
I'll figure it out.

84
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,612
I'll figure it out.

85
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,741
I'll... I'm Casper fucking Cote.

86
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,078
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

87
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,541
I'm going to go figure it, OK?

88
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,591
Yeah, I'll call you.

89
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,926
<i>I'll-</i> I'll... I'll
catch you later.

90
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,074
OK, so has anyone here
ever heard of the Jim twins?

91
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,325
The Jim twins.

92
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,117
No one?

93
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:07,910
All of you?

94
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,244
OK.

95
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,998
Jim Lewis and Jim Springer
were identical twins,

96
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,292
separated at birth,
given up for adoption

97
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,045
and raised by different
families in different parts

98
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:22,508
of the country, unaware
that the other even existed.

99
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,928
And then one day when they
were 39 years old, they met.

100
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,597
And they got to
talking, and guess what?

101
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,349
They found out that
they both married

102
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,851
women named Betty,
had gotten divorced,

103
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,562
and remarried to
women named Linda.

104
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,316
They both had sons
named James Alan.

105
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,610
They both bit their
nails and had migraines.

106
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,863
They both went to the
exact same beach in Florida

107
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,449
for vacation, both of them.

108
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,327
They both love NASCAR,
hated baseball.

109
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,996
They both voted the same,
drank the same beer,

110
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,249
smoked the same cigarettes.

111
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:59,628
When it was all said and
done, they both died apart

112
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,506
on the same day from
the same illness.

113
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,049
That's fucked up.

114
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:08,345
Well... yeah, that's fucked up.

115
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,013
We don't say that,
but yeah, it is.

116
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,392
So just think about how
maybe some of those choices,

117
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,020
maybe they're... maybe they
aren't choices at all.

118
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,190
Maybe some things are
beyond your control.

119
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,360
And so now, going back to
the story, well, where do you

120
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:27,281
guys think that Pony Boy
falls in... in all this?

121
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,768
Because certainly he's dealing
with a lot of peer pressure,

122
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,576
right?

123
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,077
There's a lot of pressure.

124
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,245
He's hanging out with his
older brother, with Soda Pop,

125
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,496
with all these guys.

126
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,664
So where do you think
he falls in all this?

127
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:36,957
Anyone got an id... Casper?

128
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,959
Can I go to the
bathroom, please?

129
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,836
We're about five minutes away.

130
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,337
You can hold it.

131
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,384
You want to take your
boots off the table there?

132
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,011
Right.

133
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:49,761
Genius.

134
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,305
Great.

135
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,472
Take your socks off, or
you're going to the office.

136
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,057
Take your socks off.

137
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,224
That's good.

138
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:55,684
That's good.

139
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,643
That's great.

140
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,686
I'm doing what you're saying.

141
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,145
Yeah, please.

142
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,313
OK, good.

143
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,856
Now you can take your
feet off the desk.

144
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,023
Smart guy.

145
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,275
Fuck.

146
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,943
Now I got to put the socks
and shoes back on, man.

147
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,612
You could have just
said that there.

148
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,363
Well, I could have.

149
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,116
Would have been... jeez, your
room's a mess here, teach.

150
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,326
My room's a mess?

151
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,660
Yeah.

152
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,827
One more out of you,

153
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,954
and you're going
down to the office.

154
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,841
Well, I got to go to
the bathroom anyways.

155
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,957
Hey, you want detention?

156
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,792
Yeah, sure, teach,
give me detention.

157
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,543
Yeah, it's a big joke,

158
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,711
right, big tough guy?

159
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,047
Everyone's aware you're
such a tough guy.

160
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,534
<i>I'll</i> show you a
fuckin' tough guy.

161
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,468
You want me to show you
fuckin' tough guy, teach?

162
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,760
I'm not, because you're
starting to fuckin'

163
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:30,719
piss me off right now.

164
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,126
All right.

165
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,782
One more word out
of you, and you're...

166
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,182
Yeah, you
said that five fuckin' words...

167
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:35,557
All right, get out.

168
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,099
Get out.

169
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,392
Yeah, fuck me.

170
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,728
Here.

171
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,732
OK, easy.

172
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,899
Hey, old Pony Boy.

173
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,902
Good people make bad choices.

174
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,695
It's fuckin' easy.

175
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,114
I'm smarter than you.

176
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,844
So you and Casper

177
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:00,207
would move to Boston together?

178
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,462
Yeah.

179
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,422
Yeah?

180
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,589
OK.

181
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,970
But not...

182
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,306
Dominic...

183
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,517
So you've
been coming to this school

184
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,602
since you were six
years old, right?

185
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,770
Right?

186
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:22,563
Yeah.

187
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,273
And now you're 17.

188
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,235
That's 2/3 of your
life you spent here.

189
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,153
Guess I know you pretty well.

190
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,155
I... I know your family.

191
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,325
I know your circumstances.

192
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:43,000
And it really angers me that
you might throw it all away.

193
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:48,505
I would imagine that
you've got a plan.

194
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,966
You've got a plan
beyond high school.

195
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,773
Have you even thought
about which colleges

196
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,052
you might like to try?

197
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,739
You act like you
want to be punished.

198
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,682
You act like you want to
be thrown out of school.

199
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,933
You act like you
want to be a failure.

200
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,477
Here's what I want you to do.

201
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,062
I want you take the break.

202
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,815
And if you want to come back to
this school, please come back.

203
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,025
But apply yourself.

204
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,191
Follow the rules.

205
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:09,610
Work hard.

206
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,028
Behave!

207
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,447
Or don't bother coming back.

208
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,614
You're done.

209
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,577
He's kind of a dick.

210
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,144
Well, fuck him.

211
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:23,956
Fuck him.

212
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,090
Oh, he says you've got
a bright future, though.

213
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,617
He said I've got
a bright future?

214
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,595
Yeah.

215
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:38,680
Yeah.

216
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,642
He started jerking off,
just thinking about you.

217
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,018
It's the truth too.

218
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,745
Yeah, he does that.

219
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,079
Get off.

220
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Get off.

221
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,477
Badger's down at Tulsa.

222
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,269
Go there.

223
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,436
Is that you, Clayton?

224
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:54,441
I said, Badger is down at Tulsa.

225
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,233
Go there.

226
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
OK, OK, OK.

227
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,362
Jesse, go there.

228
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,530
Jesse!

229
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,618
Jesse, get out of
my... get off my por...

230
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:05,785
close the fucking door.

231
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,482
That's it.

232
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,649
It's in there.

233
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,620
What's wrong with Clayton?

234
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:49,787
What do you mean?

235
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,206
Wouldn't even open the door.

236
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,749
You don't know better than that?

237
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,876
He don't like doing
business at home.

238
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,921
Besides, he don't trust
no one but family.

239
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,757
Or fuckin' second cousins.

240
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:01,508
Second cousins?

241
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,176
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

242
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,803
That's all family.

243
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,763
Everybody's a second
cousin to everybody.

244
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,348
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

245
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,835
You don't
trust no one but me, OK?

246
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,600
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

247
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,769
Look at me.

248
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,312
You don't trust no one but me.

249
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,939
Yeah, I don't trust
no one but you,

250
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,191
but... ahem... your
brother's a weird dude.

251
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,558
You're a fuckin' weird dude.

252
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,903
Get the fuck out.

253
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,405
Get out.

254
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,658
Take your powdered donuts
and get the fuck out.

255
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,825
Fuck you.

256
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,453
Fuck me?

257
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,295
Well, fuck you, all right, Sal?

258
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,461
Hmm?

259
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,630
Sorry about that.

260
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,382
That guy was bad.

261
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,717
I don't like that guy.

262
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,093
That guy was a bad guy.

263
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,284
Hey, how'd it go?

264
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,493
Good, I think, you know.

265
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,537
Um, got a bottle of
big dogs there, yeah.

266
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,330
Big dogs?

267
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,496
Yeah.

268
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,248
That's a good score there.

269
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,583
Yeah.

270
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,335
And, uh, something that I
think are hydro's, maybe.

271
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,377
Well yeah, I'll take a look.

272
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,544
OK.

273
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,302
Yes, sir.

274
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,304
Hydro's.

275
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,680
That's real good.

276
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,487
I can do that whenever
you need, you know.

277
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,224
Uh-huh.

278
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:33,600
Yeah.

279
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,267
Book it.

280
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,685
Book it.

281
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,646
Looks like a rock there.

282
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,812
Fantastic.

283
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,613
And how is your, uh...
how's your cunt mother?

284
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,989
I don't know.

285
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,366
She's always in a bad
mood, that one there, yeah.

286
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:49,991
I know.

287
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,118
Yeah.

288
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,411
Yeah.

289
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,080
Has she shit out any
more kids since I've last

290
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,331
seen her dumb ass?

291
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,334
Um... I don't think so, no.

292
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:06,257
Well, um, tell her fuck you
from your old man, will you?

293
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,385
Sure, yeah.

294
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,671
Yeah, well, I'll call you.

295
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,388
Or just come by anytime.

296
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,180
Yeah?

297
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:12,681
Uh-huh.

298
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,890
Yeah, sure.

299
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,392
All right.

300
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,893
I'll... I'll be by, or you
call me then, you know?

301
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,563
I know, but I...
I will call you.

302
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,730
Good.

303
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,364
Why are you crying?

304
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,740
'Cause I'm so...

305
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,285
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause you
want a gold, gold, fish?

306
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,120
What?

307
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,163
I got to go get... Michael!

308
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,039
Where's Mom?

309
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,206
Hey, where's Mom?

310
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,918
She went for a nap.

311
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:42,293
A what?

312
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,837
"A nap!

313
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,630
That's where she is, huh?

314
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,798
You eat lunch yet?

315
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,383
Hey, go upstairs, you guys.

316
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,342
Yeah, you.

317
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,510
Upstairs.

318
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,345
Gerard, take them
upstairs there.

319
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,763
Follow Gerard there.

320
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,223
I don't
want to go to take a nap!

321
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:55,765
I know.

322
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:56,933
It's OK.

323
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,809
But Gerard will
take care of you.

324
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,769
I want Mama!

325
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,323
You ever been shot with
a potato cannon, Dayton?

326
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:12,949
No.

327
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:13,783
"No?

328
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,576
I bet it would hurt?

329
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:15,743
DON'T you?

330
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,247
Probably would, yeah.

331
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:19,914
Yeah.

332
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,081
You want to see?

333
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:24,544
OK.

334
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,462
OK.

335
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,089
How about this?

336
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,299
I sit here for 30 seconds.

337
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,800
If you can get
that thing loaded,

338
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,927
<i>I'll</i> let you shoot me with it.

339
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,472
What are you doing here, you?

340
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,057
I live here, Kim.

341
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,183
I told you not to bring
that thing in the house.

342
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,869
Oh, I could say the
same thing to you.

343
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,729
OK, mister big shot.

344
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,190
You want to start paying rent,
you can start having a say.

345
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,776
Uh, I'm... I'm still...
I'm still 17, Kim.

346
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,742
Don't you get enough
money from me being here?

347
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:54,949
I'm sorry, baby.

348
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,476
It's all right.

349
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:09,797
I put on the moose video.

350
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,007
Penelope started crying.

351
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,843
Oh, did she?

352
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,719
Oh, yeah.

353
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:15,929
Dad says, fuck you!

354
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,263
Yeah, well, fuck him too.

355
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,944
I'm going to be late.

356
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,362
You've got like an hour.

357
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,608
Well, it's going to take
me that long if I'm lucky.

358
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,241
The car's making that
weird noise again.

359
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,867
Are you going to
be here for supper?

360
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,370
No, I'm going to the
Tasty Food with Casper, so.

361
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,536
Oh.

362
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,417
What?

363
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,669
Well, it'll have to do.

364
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,381
Come on!

365
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,547
Car.

366
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,355
Well, I don't hear it.

367
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,522
OK.

368
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:14,523
Come on.

369
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:11,122
Are we spraying them for
bugs to protect the flowers?

370
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,000
It's called Sugar Mover.

371
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,085
It's like a fertilizer.

372
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,837
But it doesn't
protect the flowers.

373
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,257
It kills the flowers.

374
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,842
But why?

375
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,635
We need to protect the potato.

376
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,847
We don't want the flower to
suck up all the nutrients.

377
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,390
We need it to go to the tuber.

378
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:34,270
That way it has a stronger,
better, healthier life.

379
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,148
If we don't, the
potatoes won't survive.

380
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,031
It's not easy.

381
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,909
Farmer to make a
living, it's not easy.

382
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,577
You'll get sick and tired
of looking at these,

383
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,870
I guarantee it.

384
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,998
But you harvest them
right and put them

385
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,793
in the proper
environment, and they'll

386
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,378
last you a good long time.

387
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,624
All right, let's go, uh,
pull them out of the ground.

388
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,928
You know how I feel
about you, Dom.

389
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,555
You've always got a place here.

390
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,932
You're a hell of a hard
worker, and you're a smart kid.

391
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,064
"Dom?

392
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,065
Yeah, what?

393
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,066
Help.

394
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,485
Hold on.

395
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,652
I'll get it.

396
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,524
Fine, I'm going
to walk over here.

397
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,128
Jeez, fucking rocks are heavy.

398
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:33,222
You know, it's weird.

399
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,869
I... I see you at
school all the time,

400
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,310
but we never really get to talk.

401
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,730
Yeah, it's like, uh,
harvest friends, right?

402
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,231
Like Austin and
I, when, you know,

403
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,817
we always talk during the
harvest, but go back to school,

404
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:45,693
it's...

405
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,320
Harvest friends.

406
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,487
Yeah.

407
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,405
So we're just
harvest friends then?

408
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,158
Ah, not yet.

409
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:52,575
Ow!

410
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,368
Oh, god.

411
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,575
Oh, it hurts to even punch
you, the backs of my arms

412
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,705
are so sore.

413
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:58,748
Yeah, I'll bet you
didn't even know

414
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,315
you had muscles
back there, did you?

415
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,751
No.

416
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,461
I've never worked
so hard in my life.

417
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:06,255
Well, it doesn't
really get any easier.

418
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:06,839
Oh, yeah?

419
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,006
Uh-huh.

420
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,468
That's great, thanks.

421
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,345
So why are you doing it?

422
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:13,679
Ah.

423
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,473
I'm saving up for next year.

424
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,182
Mm-hmm?

425
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,642
For college.

426
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,809
You?

427
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,229
Car.

428
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,398
You've been working like
this all year for a car?

429
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,192
Two years.

430
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,445
Oh my gosh, I definitely
couldn't do that.

431
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:30,852
Ah, you haven't seen the car.

432
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,926
I'm getting real close.

433
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,386
I should have enough
with the harvest here.

434
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,055
I ain't going nowhere.

435
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,742
You'll let me know
if you get an offer?

436
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:58,807
I said I would.

437
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,359
You're getting real close.

438
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,526
Yeah, I know.

439
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,404
Maybe a couple more
checks, you know?

440
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,571
Yeah.

441
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,012
That's fuckin' kicked.

442
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,900
Look at that!

443
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,818
Eh?

444
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:33,778
Let's go.

445
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,781
I want to break some shit.

446
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,324
Yeah.

447
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,201
All right.

448
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,661
That's what's up with that.

449
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:42,953
Keep going, keep going.

450
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,540
All right, come on!

451
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,707
It's there.

452
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,293
Just fuck it!

453
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,544
Whoa!

454
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,384
Holy shit!

455
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,630
Let's go shoot it with
some fuckin' potatoes, yeah?

456
00:27:58,636 --> 00:27:59,676
Yeah.

457
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,061
All right.

458
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,281
See if it's strong enough.

459
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,210
<i>N" gm!</i>

460
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,261
It's all bullshit.

461
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,848
You know, by third grade
they've fuckin' decided,

462
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,642
bang, who's staying,
who's going.

463
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,519
They're either going
to care about you,

464
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,486
or they're not going to
give a fuck about you.

465
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,859
They're always calling me
into the fuckin' guidance

466
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:40,404
counselor's office.

467
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,907
And it is bullshit.

468
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,867
They're wrong.

469
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,410
But then again,
none of it's going

470
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,137
to matter anyway, so
fuck 'em, you know?

471
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,195
I knew you were going
to fuckin' do that.

472
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:43,152
This works out, we can make a
fuck-ton of money, me and you.

473
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,363
What about this thing
with the Keegans?

474
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,657
You know, where you've got
45 Hell's Angels just up

475
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,993
the road there at Bear Lake?

476
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,037
Hell's Angels want to do
battle with the Keegans, who

477
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,873
are running meth
and coke south up.

478
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,877
Meth's between the Angels
and Phil and Bobby Keegan.

479
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,921
Keegans being
green-lit got shit-all

480
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,422
to do with us, as
far as I'm concerned.

481
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:07,927
'IS that... nus n
me or "us n,

482
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,929
like you and your guys?

483
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,221
Both.

484
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,140
Both is fair game.

485
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:16,352
It stands right now, that
includes the gatekeepers.

486
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,021
As long as we stick to
running pot and pills,

487
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,982
Hell's Angels got no business
knowing our business.

488
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:27,196
This works out with
the Florida guy,

489
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:32,159
we're slamming pills all
down the I-95 corridor.

490
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:36,246
It starts right now,
right here, with us.

491
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,504
Don't fuck this up, all right?

492
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,842
Let's load them up.

493
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,116
Hello, sir.

494
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,033
How are you today?

495
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,867
I'm good, thank you.

496
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,034
How are you?

497
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,328
Not too bad.

498
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,495
What is your citizenship?

499
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,289
I'm an American.

500
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,736
Hold on just a minute, please.

501
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,484
What was the purpose of
your trip to Canada today?

502
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,695
Uh, got a pizza at the
Little House of Pizza.

503
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,405
You purchase anything
else besides the pizza?

504
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:52,656
No, sir.

505
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:53,866
Is there anything
else in the truck

506
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,159
that doesn't belong to you?

507
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,325
No, sir, it's all mine.

508
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,411
All right, thank you very much.

509
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:58,245
Have a good day.

510
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,412
Thank you.

511
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,749
Did this guy do something wrong?

512
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,795
Oh, I don't know, but
we're about to find out.

513
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:20,851
What about, uh...
uh,<i>Jesse's</i> brother?

514
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:21,477
What's his name?

515
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:22,643
Ethan.

516
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:25,897
Yeah.

517
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,280
You know.

518
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,448
Ahem.

519
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,241
He said he would,
uh, pay... pay me

520
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,161
when he got his welfare check.

521
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:43,707
He'd get the rest to me,
uh, the first of the month.

522
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:44,874
OK.

523
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,297
Your job is to keep them
between the ditches.

524
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,424
They go off the road, they
start to fall behind...

525
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,791
All right, I'll talk to him.

526
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,010
I mean, you know
what I'm saying.

527
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,179
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:03,268
OK, well... my brother.

529
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,186
<i>Yaw.!</i>

530
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,771
Where's my fucking money?

531
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,064
Where's my fucking money?

532
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,607
Give me my fucking money!

533
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,526
Where's my fucking money?

534
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,528
All right, seriously.

535
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:13,278
I'm serious.

536
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,445
He's my little brother!

537
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,447
He's my little brother!

538
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,824
Whoa!

539
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,368
Wait, too... that went
on way too fucking long.

540
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:20,655
I'm only kidding you, man.

541
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:21,245
Oh, are you?

542
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,411
Jesus Christ!

543
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,748
Yeah, I've been working on
some slight modifications.

544
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,547
Oh yeah?

545
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,133
Added this big-ass
fuel tank back here.

546
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,299
Climb up.

547
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,580
I think you're
going to dig this.

548
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:39,513
Get closer.

549
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Take a good whiff.

550
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,895
Yeah, gas.

551
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,523
Diesel.

552
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,571
But over here
we'll add 3/4-inch.

553
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,197
You see that pump?

554
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:58,073
Uh-huh.

555
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Give me the hose.

556
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,366
OK.

557
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,715
<i>I'll plug it in.</i>

558
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,564
Kill it!

559
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,156
Oh, shit!

560
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,584
Yeah, three of them.

561
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:51,951
Tighter than a midget's pussy.

562
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:04,556
No more "frozen river in the
middle of the night" bullshit.

563
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,434
Now we drive it across
in broad daylight.

564
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:13,482
The pipeline to Canada's
south runs through us.

565
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,485
And with what we got
coming up from Florida,

566
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,112
we'll be working I-95
in both directions.

567
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:55,732
Wait.

568
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:56,233
Wait.

569
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,984
Wait!

570
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,403
What?

571
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,363
Wait.

572
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,907
I want to tell you something.

573
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,742
Did I do something?

574
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,328
No.

575
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,495
What?

576
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,792
Stop-

577
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,339
I want you to know...

578
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,636
What?

579
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:36,982
That I can take care of you.

580
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:40,402
I can take care of you and
that fuckin' baby inside you.

581
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,988
My baby inside you.

582
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,823
And I promise I will.

583
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,699
I promise.

584
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,034
I promise.

585
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,410
I promise I'm not
going to fuck this up.

586
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:52,539
I swear to god I'm not
going to fuck this up.

587
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,251
I'm going to take care
of... of both of you.

588
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,418
OK?

589
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,849
Want to fuck me?

590
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,989
Well, you fuck up this
time of year, you're dead.

591
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,241
And half their pitching
staff is injured.

592
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:29,117
Right.

593
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,786
And the other half just sucks.

594
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,621
I mean, even if they make
the playoffs, who cares?

595
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:33,580
Hey, guys?

596
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:34,787
Yeah?

597
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,110
I could use some help over here.

598
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:39,961
Yeah.

599
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,648
Let me try to lift
the roller up there.

600
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,511
So.

601
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,639
So, uh, do you like the Sox?

602
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:54,851
I mean, I like some
players, like Pedroia.

603
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,258
Not rooting against them there,
but not building my plans

604
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,730
and dreams around them either.

605
00:39:58,897 --> 00:39:59,897
Whoa, man.

606
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,108
She's shitting on your dreams.

607
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,922
Are you OK?

608
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,215
Yeah, Emma, I'm fine.

609
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,382
Why?

610
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:27,865
You know, I was
just joking before.

611
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,928
You know, you said you were
moving to Boston with Casper

612
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,930
to go to Red Sox
games, so I was just

613
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,557
trying to be funny about it.

614
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,767
You know, I... I get it.

615
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,354
I get that you don't get
it, and that's... that's OK.

616
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,773
Look, I didn't mean to be
mean about your friend there.

617
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,150
I just... I don't know.

618
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,876
I just always hear
about all the trouble

619
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:45,986
he gets in all the time.

620
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,904
Like he got Tasha
Nadeau pregnant,

621
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,191
and she's like 15 years old.

622
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:49,906
I just don't...

623
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:50,657
You sound like everyone else.

624
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:51,992
They don't get it.

625
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,759
It's like when... say
you're out drowning

626
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,749
on Long Lake and someone
throws you a life vest.

627
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,998
That's... that's Casper.

628
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,645
He's there to throw
you a life vest?

629
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,666
No.

630
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,627
No, Casper is the life vest.

631
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,795
OK?

632
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,589
You know, he's
always been there.

633
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,507
I know exactly what
I'm getting with him.

634
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,844
And then when I'm around him,
I don't feel like I'm drowning.

635
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,637
When I hang out
with Casper, I know

636
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,222
something crazy is
going to happen.

637
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,029
But you know, at least
something happened.

638
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:27,110
You know, I don't know
very much about the Red Sox.

639
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:31,323
But I do know that I'm
supposed to hate the Yankees.

640
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,490
Yeah.

641
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,242
I got to teach you how to sweep.

642
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,747
My god, this is terrible.

643
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,310
You think that's going to work?

644
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:18,328
Move.

645
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,495
Move.

646
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:20,997
Fuckin' hammer.

647
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,284
Here, this is how you do it.

648
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:41,142
OK, it's on.

649
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,394
It should pop up
as a new network.

650
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:43,061
Yeah.

651
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:43,687
Fuck.

652
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:44,896
Yeah?

653
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:45,522
We got fucking
Wi-Fi in this shit.

654
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:46,689
Awesome!

655
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:53,572
Relationship... you guys are
in a relationship now, huh?

656
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,323
I guess she's like your
baby mama though, right?

657
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,490
Fuck you.

658
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,576
You know.

659
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,035
Fuck it.

660
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,454
Why don't you just
click on her there?

661
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,540
Oh, Emma Daigle there.

662
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:04,874
Why would
she be friends with Tasha?

663
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,167
Oh, girls don't

664
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,134
have to like each other
to be friends on here.

665
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,338
Girls don't have to like each
other to be fuckin' friends.

666
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,215
And that's the
fuckin' truth there.

667
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:13,425
Oh, here we go.

668
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,511
Her favorite quote...
sometimes good things

669
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:20,557
have to fall apart so that...
so that better things can

670
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:21,724
fall together.

671
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,850
Oh, yeah.

672
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,024
You guys are all
fuckin' geniuses.

673
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,470
At least, that's what you think.

674
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,631
You all think you're
the first ones who

675
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,114
ever thought of something.

676
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,325
Like you're the
ones who invented

677
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,868
bringing shit across a border.

678
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,624
Let me tell you something.

679
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,459
We got you.

680
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:50,378
You're done.

681
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:54,341
Charged, but cooperating.

682
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:58,261
You do understand, uh,
cooperating defendant part?

683
00:43:58,428 --> 00:43:59,428
That's on you.

684
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,936
For a felony, you're looking
at starting at four years.

685
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:10,190
So what?

686
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:11,357
I do four years in jail.

687
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:11,858
Who cares?

688
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,235
Oh yeah, OK.

689
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,946
Jail.

690
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,699
Jail is not federal prison.

691
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,023
You're not a smart
guy, are you, Lee?

692
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:33,754
All right.

693
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,131
Do you think you're smart?

694
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,967
Or do you know deep down
inside that you are not smart?

695
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,134
I hate Jesse.

696
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,182
Don't blame your fuckin' cousin.

697
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,725
No one's fuckin' solid no more.

698
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:46,892
No, no, no, no.

699
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,478
You're right about that.

700
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:49,685
Drugs will do that to you.

701
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,444
But Jesse, he's a bright guy.

702
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,489
He wanted to keep his passport
so he could cross over

703
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:00,699
to Canada.

704
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,909
Said something about
hockey and strip clubs

705
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,953
being important to him.

706
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,083
So when we asked
him to wear a wire,

707
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,378
that bright son of a bitch
took all of about one

708
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,423
and a half, maybe two
seconds to think it over.

709
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,007
Oh, he's a bright guy.

710
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,635
He's in Canada right now
with a big old set of titties

711
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,555
flapping in his
face, knowing him.

712
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,605
Yeah.

713
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,150
Then again, you've
got nothing to lose.

714
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,316
Right?

715
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:41,948
Phew.

716
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:43,450
You want us to
tell the prosecutor

717
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,616
you've been cooperative.

718
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,997
You do realize
that you are going

719
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:50,874
to actually need to
cooperate, right?

720
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,379
Right?

721
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:16,815
Fuck!

722
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:39,506
I have
children, 4 boys and 4 girls,

723
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,841
and 12 grandchildren and
<i>2</i> great-grandchildren.

724
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,514
Hey, did you remember
my cookie dough?

725
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,057
I helped him move on

726
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,810
after he served a tour
in the Korean War.

727
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,813
That was hard enough 'til I...

728
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:55,979
Baby?

729
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,734
Baby, what's wrong?

730
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,416
Shit, that's so good.

731
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,792
That is so good.

732
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:01,754
Mmm, so awesome.

733
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:06,342
Thank you.

734
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:17,270
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

735
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:20,231
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

736
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,610
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

737
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,326
I'm private, OK?

738
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,828
I don't need your stupid
fuckin' friends, none of that.

739
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,664
Do you even love me?

740
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,167
Tasha, why do we... you
always make it like this.

741
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:39,709
Do I love you?

742
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:40,460
Do I love you?

743
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:41,961
Do I love you?

744
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,213
OK, my friends... my
friends are not stupid, OK?

745
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,048
You're stupid.

746
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,591
That one's fuckin' stupid.

747
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,426
What the fuck is wrong with you?

748
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,640
What the fuck is... come here.

749
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,016
Look at me.

750
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:57,268
Are you fuckin' drunk?

751
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,770
Are you... you're fuckin' drunk.

752
00:48:58,937 --> 00:48:59,479
No.

753
00:48:59,646 --> 00:48:59,854
Look at you.

754
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:00,480
"No!

755
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:01,189
Fuck me.

756
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:01,564
No.

757
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:02,732
No.

758
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:03,399
What the fuck is wrong with you?

759
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:04,275
No, I'm not drunk!

760
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,602
Keep your fuckin' voice down.

761
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:06,235
I'm not drunk.

762
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:07,402
Yes, you... stop it.

763
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,445
Smell anything?

764
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,910
I'm not drunk, OK?

765
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:15,411
I'm not drunk.

766
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,287
It's OK.

767
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,774
And you're... you're an asshole.

768
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,581
No.

769
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:19,999
And you don't love me.

770
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,251
And you don't love
your baby, OK?

771
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,338
Just keep
your fuckin' voice down.

772
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,589
Just keep your
fuckin' voice down.

773
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,174
Don't fuckin'...

774
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:30,134
I'm having Casper Cote's baby!

775
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,222
Asshole!

776
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,411
Hey, asshole, how'd
it go with Tasha?

777
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,663
All right.

778
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,039
Phew.

779
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,333
You know what they say there.

780
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,252
Sometimes good
things have to fall

781
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:08,506
apart so that better things
can fall together, you know?

782
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:09,713
That's very funny there.

783
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,175
It is pretty funny.

784
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,802
Now I know why you have
to date 15-year-olds.

785
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,596
Oh.

786
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,016
Oh, fuck me!

787
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:18,808
Hey!

788
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:20,268
Moose safari.

789
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:21,144
You guys want to go?

790
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,438
What's a moose safari?

791
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:31,404
"What's a moose safari?"

792
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:39,912
Oh my god!

793
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,289
Oh my god!

794
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:43,499
Oh my god!

795
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,502
Oh my god!

796
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:07,356
Little pink flower,
what's your little name?

797
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,735
Little pink flower,
what's your little name?

798
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,046
That was so fucking fun!

799
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,693
Don't tell me that
wasn't fucking fun.

800
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,424
I told you it was fucking fun.

801
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,591
Woo-hoo!

802
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:38,679
We don't always get one.

803
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,556
That was wicked cool.

804
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,184
Sometimes they get killed if
we, like, hit it, you know...

805
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:44,060
Watch it, man.

806
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:45,061
Hey, man, you bumped into me.

807
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:46,228
What did you say to me?

808
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:47,063
I... I don't want
to start anything.

809
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:47,939
What did you say?

810
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:48,648
I don't want to start anything.

811
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:49,607
I'm just...

812
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:50,358
Who do you think you are?

813
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:51,692
Don't touch me!

814
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,237
'Casper?

815
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:54,695
Hold this.

816
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:55,862
Hold this.

817
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,073
Get out of my face.

818
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:57,782
You don't want to
get out of my face?

819
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:58,616
Don't shove me, man.

820
00:51:58,783 --> 00:51:59,575
Casper.

821
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:00,785
Casper!

822
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:01,702
Casper!

823
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:02,869
Casper, you win, buddy.

824
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:03,704
Come on.

825
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:04,622
Come on, buddy, it's OK.

826
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:05,790
Get the fuck off me.

827
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:06,332
Hey, hey, hey!

828
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:07,499
Hey!

829
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Come on.

830
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,510
You fuckin' put
your hands on him,

831
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:18,957
you put your
fuckin' hands on me.

832
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,472
You understand that there?

833
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,516
You don't ever
fuckin' walk in here

834
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:26,102
and put your fuckin'
hands on him!

835
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:29,522
You go back to fuckin' Madawaska
where you fucking came.

836
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:32,525
Crack, take your fucking
crack crew with you.

837
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,695
What the fuck are
you looking at?

838
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:38,531
I said, get fuckin' walking!

839
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:39,699
What are you looking at?

840
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,117
Get the fuck out of here!

841
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,284
Yeah, you!

842
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,126
Your buddies are
going there, kiddo.

843
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:52,503
Casper, come on, man.

844
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,670
Casper.

845
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:01,220
You come around here, you
ask about Casper fuckin' Cote.

846
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,175
I run the fuckin' county, kid.

847
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,229
Well...

848
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,035
I am not feeling sorry for you.

849
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:07,411
You're going to be
late for harvest.

850
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,658
What's George going to say?

851
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,414
Well, I don't even
start until later.

852
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,584
You feel good right now?

853
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,170
It's the same story every
time you hang out with him.

854
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,214
God, it's not...
it's not Casper.

855
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,381
"No?

856
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:20,466
Oh, so is it you?

857
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:21,926
Yeah, I don't think so.

858
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,719
Trouble does not fall
far from the tree.

859
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,429
You're so much better than him.

860
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,639
I'm... I'm not.

861
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,086
OK, we're... we're no different.

862
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:29,600
All you want to
talk about is just

863
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,807
me going and working for
George the rest of my life.

864
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:32,853
Yeah, because it's
a good opportunity,

865
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,563
and it's there if you want it.

866
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,107
It's fuckin' here if I want it.

867
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,821
No, I can't.

868
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:44,407
I'm telling you, no, I can't.

869
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,410
Uh, I'm... I'm fuckin'... I'm...
I'm shittin' my... my guts out

870
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:51,414
my ass here, OK?

871
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,208
Uh, yeah, I've got food
poisoned or something.

872
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:57,003
I don't know, but I'm... it's
coming out of both ends,

873
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,379
and... and I can't...
I can't make it.

874
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,214
Five... five minutes.

875
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:08,180
I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll,
uh... no, I... I'm telling you,

876
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,057
I can't fucking
do it, all right?

877
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,864
You're going to have
to get somebody else.

878
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,021
I'm sorry.

879
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,190
OK.

880
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,096
4463/-

881
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,431
Wake up.

882
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:53,309
Get up.

883
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:54,476
I need you.

884
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:27,551
Hey there, you!

885
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,095
Hey!

886
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,304
How you been?

887
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:30,846
Hey, Casper.

888
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,139
How you doing?

889
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,306
Casper the Ghost, eh?

890
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:33,933
Yeah.

891
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:34,683
That's my friend Dom here.

892
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,393
Hi.

893
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,018
Look at him.

894
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:36,685
What's his name?

895
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,395
Dominic.

896
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:38,229
Oh, Dominic.

897
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:38,604
Yeah.

898
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:39,105
Yeah.

899
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:39,438
Oh.

900
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:39,814
Hi.

901
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,314
Hi.

902
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:41,023
Hi

903
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,524
You got a French name.

904
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,025
Yeah.

905
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,568
If you want those, I got
those that you can have.

906
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:45,736
Yeah, my
uncle couldn't come this week.

907
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,071
Yeah.

908
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:47,613
Yeah, so you can
pick them up for him.

909
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,780
Yeah.

910
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,539
Yeah, there.

911
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:57,456
You like them?

912
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:57,832
They suit you.

913
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:58,290
Yeah.

914
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,125
Hmm.

915
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,167
Here, Dom, these are yours.

916
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,293
They're more Frenchy than yours.

917
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,128
Yeah?

918
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:05,256
Here, you wear mine.

919
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:06,503
I like yours too, though.

920
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:06,715
Yeah.

921
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:07,882
Yeah.

922
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,844
You're ready for an ATV, you.

923
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,010
Vroom, vroom!

924
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,430
Well, you guys have to leave?

925
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,916
Uh, I mean, is there anything
else we can do for you, or?

926
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,267
Yeah.

927
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,269
When you have time, you
can do the bird feeder

928
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,354
because it's too
far out of my reach.

929
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:21,105
Yeah.

930
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,273
You can fill it up.

931
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,774
Yeah, happy to help.

932
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,860
And then when you have more
time, you can do some wood.

933
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,426
"Anything else we
can do for you?"

934
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,528
Really?

935
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:29,811
You know, I felt sorry for her.

936
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:30,364
I mean, she's old.

937
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:31,907
She's a sweet lady.

938
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,827
She makes $3,600 a month on
pills she pays $4 a bottle for,

939
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:35,994
all right?

940
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,330
She should feel sorry for us.

941
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:39,497
Pour it in.

942
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:44,628
Yeah.

943
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:45,795
We're good?

944
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:47,673
Yeah.

945
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,133
Look at these fat birds.

946
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,678
You see those holes there?

947
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:54,680
She shoots the
raccoons from inside.

948
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:56,056
She'll just sit there, bang!

949
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,270
Here you go.

950
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:06,150
And, uh, thank you for
your service, you know?

951
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:22,957
You want some?

952
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,378
No, I'm, uh... I'm good.

953
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:27,796
You?

954
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:31,425
No, no, I'm, uh... I'm
good too, thank you.

955
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:37,640
Uh, Mr. Borgia, we're...
we're here for, um, you know...

956
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,350
my uncle couldn't, but, uh...

957
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:42,478
Right now the cheapest thing
you can eat is peanut butter,

958
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:47,525
but put it on a cracker
with a banana pepper,

959
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,691
it ain't half bad.

960
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:49,692
Sounds good, yeah.

961
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,195
Arthur!

962
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,030
Just give him the damn pills
already and come back to bed.

963
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,757
Do you have to talk
everybody's ear off?

964
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,033
Do you have to
come out and chum up

965
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,440
to every guy who comes in here?

966
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:58,869
Bring the crackers.

967
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,036
Come to bed.

968
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,599
Let's get the fuck out of here.

969
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,535
All right!

970
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,828
Whee!

971
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,277
Now, you did good.

972
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,364
You did real good.

973
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,908
Now, you want this
to be something more

974
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:44,395
than just an
after-school special?

975
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,537
You want this to grow
into something bigger?

976
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:49,790
Then you need to know
the business, OK?

977
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,125
OK.

978
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:55,671
Now, Badger, he
learned the business,

979
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,048
but he don't know business.

980
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:58,882
You understand?

981
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,551
Mm-hmm.

982
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:03,220
I mean, he got no mind for it.

983
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:10,728
But you, with you we
might have something.

984
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,021
Who are we?

985
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,857
You know, who are
we in all of this?

986
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:18,610
We're... well, we're...

987
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:19,862
Little fish.

988
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:20,571
Yeah?

989
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,281
Yeah.

990
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:27,077
Yeah, we're little fish in
the big pond, gasping for air.

991
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:31,331
But the doctors that write those
scripts and the pharmacies that

992
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,334
fill those scripts and the
companies that distribute all

993
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:39,047
them big bad drugs... well,
they're the big fish.

994
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:39,840
You know?

995
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,383
They're like Moby Dick.

996
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,050
Remember?

997
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:42,426
Yeah.

998
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:43,593
Yeah?

999
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:44,594
Yeah.

1000
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:46,346
Moby Dick in a
fucking kiddie pool.

1001
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:51,018
The bottom line
of the whole deal,

1002
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,103
we are just a spoke in
a very fucked-up wheel.

1003
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,694
It's funny, you know?

1004
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,301
Almost everyone I know right now
is working the potato harvest

1005
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:45,948
there.

1006
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:46,490
Yeah.

1007
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:49,201
And I'm here.

1008
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:51,728
I would much rather be here
than work in the potato harvest.

1009
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:17,001
So did George tell
you you're going

1010
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:21,191
to be working with
Josh tomorrow?

1011
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,693
What do you mean?

1012
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,460
Well, my parents are
taking me to Vermont

1013
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:25,568
to look at colleges there.

1014
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:30,868
That's great.

1015
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,452
Yeah, it should be pretty cool.

1016
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,666
What?

1017
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,313
Then you're not going to back
with the harvester for a while.

1018
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,872
Ow.

1019
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,415
Twig or something.

1020
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,083
Ow.

1021
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,250
Be careful.

1022
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,841
I want to get
a place, like a place for us.

1023
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:32,304
Like... like for us and the baby.

1024
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:34,231
Before the baby comes,
we should get a place.

1025
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,393
What?

1026
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,229
Don't you think?

1027
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,396
<i>Uh...</i>

1028
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,274
Don't you want to live with me?

1029
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,484
Yeah.

1030
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:48,695
And I'm going to pay
for that, though, right?

1031
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,739
That's what you're saying.

1032
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:51,946
That's what you're saying.

1033
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,152
Are you going to pay for it?

1034
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,287
I'm just saying I
want to get a place.

1035
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,830
OK.

1036
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,959
And I'm just asking you, who's
going to pay for that there?

1037
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,210
Well, do you want
people to think

1038
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:06,296
that you can't take care of me?

1039
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,463
Your own baby?

1040
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:12,511
Excuse me?

1041
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:14,221
I thought you said you were
going to take care of us.

1042
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,515
Oh, don't fucking start.

1043
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:17,975
Don't get... stop.

1044
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,309
Don't fuckin' start.

1045
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:20,476
Don't... Tasha!

1046
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,399
Just-just shut up, please.

1047
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,650
Just stop.

1048
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:28,819
Just shut the fuck
up, please, Tasha.

1049
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:29,986
Don't tell me to shut up.

1050
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:30,779
Tasha...

1051
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,614
Don't tell me to shut up.

1052
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:34,241
OK, I'm sorry.

1053
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:36,451
Just stop talking, please.

1054
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:37,744
Everyone's going

1055
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,997
to think you're a stupid jerk.

1056
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,323
Oh, really?
Everyone's going to think

1057
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,332
I'm a stupid jerk?

1058
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:44,793
Is that what they're
going to think?

1059
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,086
On the fuckin'
playground, they're

1060
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:49,089
going to think that I'm
a stupid fucking jerk?

1061
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:50,757
On my best fucking
day, they're going

1062
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,092
to think I'm a
stupid fucking jerk.

1063
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:53,635
That's the truth there.

1064
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,482
I don't give a fuck
what any of them think.

1065
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,570
Oh, fuck.

1066
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:34,467
Oh, fuck.

1067
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:39,148
What are you thinking about?

1068
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,915
What?

1069
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:49,209
Casper.

1070
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:51,378
Oh my gosh, why are you
thinking about Casper

1071
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:52,545
right now?

1072
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:53,839
Oh, not exactly.

1073
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:57,843
It's... here, let me... let
me show you some pictures

1074
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,719
of my car.

1075
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,304
Oh, the car.

1076
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,557
The car.

1077
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,433
Check that out.

1078
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,727
Oh, wow.

1079
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,438
That's wicked cool.

1080
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,445
You know, I was thinking
about the other night,

1081
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:15,152
and I think I get it now.

1082
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,028
You know, he's... he's
really not half bad.

1083
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:21,699
Here.

1084
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,375
I always thought if I could just

1085
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:34,921
earn enough to get this
car, then we could just go,

1086
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,048
and everything would be better.

1087
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:39,926
You know?

1088
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,511
Like everything
we've been doing up

1089
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:46,308
to now has been to
get to this one night.

1090
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:49,436
I'm so close.

1091
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:56,693
Casper just... I just thought
leaving would be easier.

1092
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,001
Sorry.

1093
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:55,961
Oh, yeah.

1094
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:57,127
Yeah, it's OK.

1095
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,303
Let's have sex.

1096
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,555
What?

1097
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,933
Yeah, we want to fuck, right?

1098
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,519
Let's fuck.

1099
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,521
I don't want to right now.

1100
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:16,523
Why not?

1101
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:17,690
I feel gross.

1102
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:18,691
Oh yeah?

1103
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:22,403
What?

1104
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,326
Take off your pants.

1105
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:32,955
What?

1106
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:35,417
Take off your pants.

1107
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:36,251
What?

1108
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,711
What's your problem?

1109
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,337
Either you take off your
fuckin' pants right fuckin'

1110
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,184
now, or I'm going to
take them off for you.

1111
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:41,923
You hear me there?

1112
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,466
Take off your fuckin' pants.

1113
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,843
Take off your fuckin' pants!

1114
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,010
Casper, stop it!

1115
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,804
Let's get the fucking pants off!

1116
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:48,971
"Stop!

1117
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,758
You're on your period, Tasha.

1118
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:01,234
You're on your period.

1119
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:04,863
<i>Uh...</i>

1120
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,739
Fuck!

1121
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,490
Yeah, you fucking are!

1122
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:08,825
Yeah, you fucking are!

1123
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,036
I see it right fucking there!

1124
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,912
What the fuck!

1125
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,873
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1126
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:15,832
Let me explain!

1127
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:16,624
Go ahead.

1128
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:17,834
Explain it to me.

1129
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,419
What?

1130
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:20,706
I don't want you to leave.

1131
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:21,754
Oh, fuck you!

1132
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,715
Then you don't fucking lie!

1133
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,633
You're a fucking liar!

1134
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,094
Fuck you!

1135
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:28,762
Fuck!

1136
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,388
God fucking damn it!

1137
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:32,891
"Stop!

1138
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:33,850
Don't go.

1139
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,017
Shut up.

1140
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:42,441
Fuck.

1141
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:33,034
OK, now.

1142
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:33,827
You see how it
gets hot like that?

1143
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:34,452
Yeah.

1144
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:34,911
Goes red?

1145
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,078
Yeah.

1146
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:37,080
That's when you add
the filler metal.

1147
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:37,580
OK.

1148
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:38,289
'See?

1149
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:38,873
And it melts it.

1150
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,250
It's like water.

1151
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:41,668
Oh.

1152
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:42,877
You see how I kind of
fucked up right there?

1153
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,629
Yeah.

1154
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:49,759
All I got to do is just heat
it up and move it with the heat

1155
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:51,719
'til it's right and smooth.

1156
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,304
And then you just fix it, yeah?

1157
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:56,808
You just fix it, and nobody
will know the difference.

1158
01:13:56,975 --> 01:13:58,143
Now, pay attention.

1159
01:13:58,309 --> 01:13:59,352
I'm paying attention!

1160
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:00,854
All right, well, you're
doing the next one.

1161
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,147
This is fuckin' dangerous.

1162
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:02,522
This is...

1163
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:03,481
I know.

1164
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:04,441
Don't hit me.

1165
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:05,066
4463/-

1166
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:05,942
Hey.

1167
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:09,696
OK, so I bring it over Tuesday.

1168
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:11,114
First thing Wednesday
morning, you're

1169
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:12,323
going to go over to Portsmouth...

1170
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,741
OK.

1171
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,748
...With that and what I
already brought across.

1172
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:17,912
Now, he's not going to show
up 'til later in the day,

1173
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,290
so you're going to meet
up right at the motel.

1174
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:24,210
And I want you to
take Casper with you.

1175
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,377
What?

1176
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:26,963
Oh.

1177
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,966
You know, I... I fuckin'... no.

1178
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:30,884
I can't.

1179
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:31,593
What?

1180
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:32,218
You can't what?

1181
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:33,428
I mean, whatever.

1182
01:14:33,595 --> 01:14:35,597
I'll... I'll drive it
down, but not with him.

1183
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,182
What are you talking about?

1184
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,559
I'm telling you, I
want him to go with you.

1185
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:40,894
You know?

1186
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:41,978
He needs to know the
route, same as you.

1187
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:44,063
Well then, fuckin'
forget it, OK?

1188
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,940
I mean... uh.

1189
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,442
You know, I don't
need him looking over

1190
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:48,609
my fuckin' shoulder.

1191
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,095
I'm not looking
over your shoulder.

1192
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,111
Is that what you think?

1193
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:52,447
No.

1194
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:55,366
I think this is about you and
your fucking trust issues.

1195
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:01,658
Badger!

1196
01:15:01,748 --> 01:15:02,540
Badger!

1197
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,000
Come back!

1198
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,251
What the fuck?

1199
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,086
Yeah.

1200
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,922
No, he'll be back.

1201
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,256
"Trust issues."

1202
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:11,090
Yeah.

1203
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:12,297
He used to be a lot worse.

1204
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:12,842
Yeah.

1205
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,887
And your trust issues.

1206
01:15:16,054 --> 01:15:17,054
Yeah.

1207
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,210
Yeah, it's definitely
my first choice.

1208
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:48,878
Uh, the campus is
really awesome.

1209
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,798
They have this, like, big
lake out there and, you know,

1210
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:54,259
like this giant outdoor mall.

1211
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:55,552
It was really cool.

1212
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:56,970
It sounds really cool.

1213
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,597
Yeah, it was really
a good trip, you know?

1214
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,683
I'm really excited
for next year.

1215
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:04,769
I had to work with creepy old
Josh the whole time, you know?

1216
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:05,936
And I missed you.

1217
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:09,398
Yeah, I missed you too.

1218
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:16,030
So is something wrong?

1219
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:21,815
I just feel like I'm... I'm
really starting to like you,

1220
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:26,541
you know, Dom, and I... I
just don't want to give you

1221
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:30,503
the wrong idea, uh, and make
you think that this can be more

1222
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:31,212
than it is.

1223
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:34,757
Because I don't know.

1224
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,926
I... I just think this kind
of has to be a harvest thing,

1225
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:37,719
you know?

1226
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:39,596
Like... like what you said.

1227
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:42,348
It's like... like
harvest friends.

1228
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,684
Harvest friends, right.

1229
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:45,977
Like you and Austin.

1230
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:47,144
Right.

1231
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:03,286
4463/-

1232
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:05,955
Got your passport, kiddo?

1233
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,373
Yeah.

1234
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,540
I need you tonight.

1235
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:36,526
What?

1236
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:37,362
Oh, her?

1237
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:38,988
She's cute, huh?

1238
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:39,947
That's a fucking beast.

1239
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:43,117
That ain't no car, kiddo.

1240
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:45,745
I've seen your script run.

1241
01:17:45,912 --> 01:17:48,289
Puts you over the
top for your car.

1242
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:49,457
That's it?

1243
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:50,624
Yeah, put that away.

1244
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,543
I suppose our share is OK.

1245
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,710
No big deal.

1246
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:54,921
No big fuckin' thing.

1247
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:01,302
Turns out I don't need
diaper money anymore, so.

1248
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:02,469
What?

1249
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,222
Don't worry about it.

1250
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:05,848
You got your passport, you?

1251
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,015
Why?

1252
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:08,810
We're going to a hockey game.

1253
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:09,976
Seriously?

1254
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:19,325
But why are you going again?

1255
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,863
Because I've got to fuckin' talk

1256
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,270
to the guy about some bullshit.

1257
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:23,407
Don't worry about it.

1258
01:18:23,408 --> 01:18:24,117
You have to talk

1259
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:25,159
to a guy about some bullshit?

1260
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:26,411
Look, I don't

1261
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:28,057
want to fuckin' talk
to you about this

1262
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,079
all night, all right?

1263
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,080
I'm late.

1264
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,418
Oh, yeah.

1265
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,629
Oh, yeah.

1266
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:39,173
Thank you.

1267
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,551
This thing's a
fuckin' beast, no?

1268
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:42,718
Oh, yeah.

1269
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:43,719
It's a piece of shit.

1270
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,263
It's a... yeah.

1271
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:52,645
He's going to the
Draveurs game, you know.

1272
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:53,980
Play in Grand Falls area.

1273
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:55,147
Ah, I hate Grand Falls.

1274
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:56,858
I know you hate Grand Falls.

1275
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,151
That's why I took you there.

1276
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,239
There he is there.

1277
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:12,832
I don't know.

1278
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:14,500
Maybe he's doing his own thing
or something, his own deals

1279
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,170
or something on the side, so.

1280
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:19,422
My dad's pissed, you know.

1281
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:20,673
It's fucked up.

1282
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:26,596
So, uh... I slept with Emma.

1283
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,711
Shut your fuckin' face.

1284
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:33,144
Oh, yeah.

1285
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:34,511
I fuckin' called that there.

1286
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:35,438
You did.

1287
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:36,606
You called it.

1288
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:37,773
How was it?

1289
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:40,777
Good.

1290
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:41,486
What?

1291
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:42,195
It was good.

1292
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:43,946
There's more to this.

1293
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:49,160
There's more to that "good" than
just wha... was she a virgin?

1294
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:50,495
I don't know.

1295
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,359
Kind of uncomfortable,
and we were

1296
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,630
in a forest with
leaves and shit.

1297
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:01,837
No, you fuckin' weren't.

1298
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:02,882
You were in a forest?

1299
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:04,049
Yeah.

1300
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,303
OK.

1301
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:11,974
Anyway, she said that we're
just harvest friends now, so.

1302
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,393
What?

1303
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,645
What the fuck is that?

1304
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:16,813
What's a harvest friend?

1305
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:19,440
I guess I just wasn't
part of her plan.

1306
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:21,108
And that's that, so.

1307
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,365
That's you being responsible?

1308
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:28,532
Just go!

1309
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:29,574
Fuck you!

1310
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,994
Oh, there he is.

1311
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:34,121
Down the stairs, dah-dah,
dah-dah, dah-dun-dun.

1312
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,790
Let's go.

1313
01:20:35,957 --> 01:20:39,001
You... you shut the fuck up!

1314
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,171
You're the one making all
the fuckin' noise out here.

1315
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,757
OK, let's
go to a fuckin' hockey game.

1316
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:46,124
Let's go.

1317
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:33,365
He's not even going in.

1318
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:34,116
I don't know.

1319
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:37,119
I don't know what he's doing.

1320
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:39,205
He says he's going
to the Draveurs game,

1321
01:22:39,372 --> 01:22:41,172
and then he's, I don't
know, sitting out here.

1322
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:44,794
Fuck.

1323
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:47,046
Come on, Badger,
what are you doing?

1324
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:49,573
Maybe he just wants a lap
dance before the game, you know?

1325
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:53,177
All right.

1326
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:54,344
Well, he's going in.

1327
01:22:56,347 --> 01:22:58,227
What
the... he's not going.

1328
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,226
Do you see that?

1329
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:01,477
What is he doing?

1330
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:02,644
He just got in that car.

1331
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:03,980
I... I don't know.

1332
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:08,442
Why is he... what
is... god damn it.

1333
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:16,741
Can I have your phone?

1334
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:28,963
Hey, it's Casper.

1335
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,548
My phone died.

1336
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:32,008
Yeah.

1337
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,259
He didn't go to the game.

1338
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:35,266
Damn fuckin' right, he
didn't go to the game.

1339
01:23:35,428 --> 01:23:38,889
He...
he... no, he's at Mon Copain.

1340
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,475
He just got into some guy's car.

1341
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:42,642
I don't know.

1342
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,186
Like, the guy just pulled up.

1343
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,480
No, he's... he was
sitting here for a while.

1344
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:47,982
Then this other guy pulls in.

1345
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:49,650
He gets up like
he's going to go in,

1346
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:52,611
and then he gets in
this other guy's car.

1347
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:53,362
Yeah.

1348
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:53,988
Yeah.

1349
01:23:54,155 --> 01:23:55,573
Oh, wait.

1350
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,820
Wait, he's getting out now.

1351
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:02,913
I don't know.

1352
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,400
I don't know who
the other guy is.

1353
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:08,836
OK.

1354
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:10,546
OK.

1355
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:11,713
OK.

1356
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:13,174
All right, he's driving off.

1357
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,341
He's going.

1358
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,051
He's going.

1359
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:16,218
And he's gone.

1360
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:17,470
OK, OK.

1361
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:17,887
And we're going to lose him.

1362
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:18,262
Yeah.

1363
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:19,805
OK, bye.

1364
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:21,212
He wants us to follow this guy.

1365
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:22,348
That guy?

1366
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,517
Yeah.

1367
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,604
Let's hope he's going
to a fucking hockey game.

1368
01:25:44,849 --> 01:25:46,129
So what now?

1369
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,271
I don't know.

1370
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:51,730
Just sit here and watch.

1371
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,996
What the hell is
he doing in there?

1372
01:26:49,163 --> 01:26:50,643
What the hell are
we doing out here?

1373
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:58,047
It's fuckin' stupid,
just sitting in this car.

1374
01:26:58,214 --> 01:26:59,673
I mean, is this...
you know, you just

1375
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,759
want to run errands for
Clayton the rest of your life.

1376
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:04,428
That's what you want to do?

1377
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:06,388
Is that what you
think I'm doing here?

1378
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:07,264
<i>I...</i>

1379
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:08,631
I want to be here right now?

1380
01:27:08,766 --> 01:27:10,126
I don't know what
you want, but I

1381
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:12,937
thought we were going to a...
to a hockey game, you know?

1382
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,730
Well, I'm sorry
about the hockey game.

1383
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:15,981
I used to think we both
wanted the same thing,

1384
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:17,274
but now we're sitting
in a car instead

1385
01:27:17,441 --> 01:27:18,481
of going to a hockey game.

1386
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:19,777
It makes no fuckin' sense.

1387
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:23,614
You used to think we both
wanted the same thing?

1388
01:27:23,781 --> 01:27:28,369
You know, you think leaving
this town is everything, right?

1389
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:30,575
We... we leave the town,
then we go into the Boston,

1390
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:31,580
and then we watch the Red Sox.

1391
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:32,747
That's the plan.

1392
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,416
That's the plan!

1393
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:35,793
Then what?

1394
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,336
What happens when the game ends?

1395
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:38,212
What?

1396
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:39,797
You tell me!

1397
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:40,965
Give me something to do.

1398
01:27:41,131 --> 01:27:42,299
I'll do it, all right?

1399
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:45,803
I'll leave, but you have
no idea what kind of money

1400
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:47,012
I could make right here.

1401
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:48,347
See, but this is
what I'm telling you.

1402
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:50,015
See, you think you're
doing something different.

1403
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:52,268
OK, you think like your dad
sees something special in you,

1404
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:53,602
you know, but you're not.

1405
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,609
You're doing exactly what
everyone in this town

1406
01:27:55,646 --> 01:27:57,646
has expected you to do
since the day you were born,

1407
01:27:57,731 --> 01:27:58,983
you included.

1408
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:00,526
OK?

1409
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:03,053
I'm... I'm the one who's always
expected something more from

1410
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:04,195
You.

1411
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:04,905
I'm the one who
believes you want

1412
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:07,199
something better for yourself.

1413
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:08,617
OK?

1414
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,203
This town has nothing
that either of us want.

1415
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:12,079
OK?

1416
01:28:12,246 --> 01:28:14,164
We're meant to leave together.

1417
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:17,167
We're not meant to stay.

1418
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,753
Shit gets old fast, Casper.

1419
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,160
And it's going to get old fast.

1420
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:42,901
Oh, shit.

1421
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,068
Oh...

1422
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:44,653
Oh, fuck.

1423
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:45,195
Fuck!

1424
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:45,988
Fuck!

1425
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:47,155
Shit.

1426
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,101
You're good here.

1427
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:35,745
Hey, where's Dom?

1428
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:57,476
What the fuck?

1429
01:29:57,643 --> 01:29:58,685
Holy shit.

1430
01:29:58,852 --> 01:29:59,561
Go, go, go, go.

1431
01:29:59,728 --> 01:29:59,937
No, Wait.

1432
01:30:00,104 --> 01:30:00,771
Wait.

1433
01:30:00,938 --> 01:30:01,647
I can't just fuckin' go, OK?

1434
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:04,066
I can't just drive the fuck off.

1435
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:04,525
Car.

1436
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:05,067
Get down!

1437
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:05,609
Get down!

1438
01:30:05,776 --> 01:30:06,318
Fuck!

1439
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:07,485
Piece of shit.

1440
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:11,698
There's three of them.

1441
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:12,865
Fuck.

1442
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:25,212
After this third, we can go.

1443
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:28,257
We'll go up quick and
get the fuck out of here.

1444
01:30:28,424 --> 01:30:31,009
Come on, let's go.

1445
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,176
Fuck!

1446
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:35,389
Let's go.

1447
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:36,682
Let's go.

1448
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:44,565
Come on!

1449
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:45,190
What?

1450
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:46,608
Fuck!

1451
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:48,615
Straight to fuckin' voice
mail, so he's already

1452
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:50,112
in fuckin' Canada.

1453
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:53,198
My god, your uncle is
such a fucking douchebag.

1454
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,368
Come on, come on.

1455
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:59,705
See, maybe like... what

1456
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:01,752
if I said he didn't have
anything to do with it,

1457
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:03,208
and that it was all me?

1458
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,586
And that... that I
planned all this,

1459
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:08,672
and... and that he
didn't do anything?

1460
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:12,717
OK.

1461
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,220
Enough already.

1462
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:23,020
He's my brother, OK?

1463
01:31:23,187 --> 01:31:26,440
He's my only brother.

1464
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:27,607
And I love him.

1465
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:35,157
And now I'm fucking him!

1466
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:36,492
Yeah.

1467
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,119
Yep, that's true.

1468
01:31:39,286 --> 01:31:42,706
He is your brother, and
you are fucking him.

1469
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:48,128
We are firmly entrenched
into fuck-you territory.

1470
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:51,715
You going to listen to me, Lee?

1471
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:53,522
Your brother is fucked
in the here and now

1472
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:54,992
because of his
choices, his actions.

1473
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,309
Only one of which is aggravated
trafficking of scheduled drugs

1474
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:06,188
across an international border
with his idiot fucking brother.

1475
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:16,615
This crying stuff, all this
remorse, you've got to... this

1476
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:18,022
has got to be in the rear view.

1477
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:19,243
You've got to put
that behind you.

1478
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:21,995
You've got to move forward.

1479
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:23,205
You've got to
think about Amanda.

1480
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:24,372
You've got a baby coming.

1481
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,588
You've got to suck it up.

1482
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:32,756
You've got to man up.

1483
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:38,637
You've got to pull
your shit together.

1484
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:39,804
Right.

1485
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,120
Here's how this is
going to play out.

1486
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:48,855
Thank you.

1487
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:50,022
Thank you.

1488
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,820
Suspect is leaving
the port of entry.

1489
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:54,838
How you doing?

1490
01:33:55,005 --> 01:33:55,631
Good.

1491
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:56,840
How are you, sir?

1492
01:33:57,007 --> 01:33:57,507
Can I get your license,
registration, proof

1493
01:33:57,674 --> 01:33:58,717
of insurance?

1494
01:33:58,884 --> 01:33:59,593
Where are you coming
from today, sir?

1495
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,802
Uh, Canada.

1496
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:01,511
Canada?

1497
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:02,304
And you're heading to?

1498
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:03,511
Home.

1499
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:06,099
I'm just going

1500
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:07,100
to check your license
and registration.

1501
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:08,267
I'll be right back.

1502
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:41,885
You guys all set?

1503
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:43,887
Just on a hunch, let me run
my canine around the vehicle.

1504
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:45,222
Yeah, that would be great.

1505
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:46,389
Sir, I'm Deputy Miller

1506
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,432
with the Sheriff's Office.

1507
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:48,934
I'm going to run my dog
around your vehicle.

1508
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:50,185
Anything illegal in the vehicle
that I need to know about?

1509
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,561
Nope.

1510
01:34:51,728 --> 01:34:53,271
If you'll exit the vehicle,
take 10 steps forward.

1511
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:55,440
Face away from the vehicle
for me while I do the search.

1512
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:56,887
Hey, I've got this pizza here.

1513
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,183
I See it.

1514
01:34:58,318 --> 01:34:59,820
You're all set.

1515
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:00,986
Jeez.

1516
01:35:30,517 --> 01:35:31,837
Oh, he smells the fuckin' pizza.

1517
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:33,478
Go back to your vehicle.

1518
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:34,813
Put your hands on the hood while
I search you and the vehicle.

1519
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,022
Walk back.

1520
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:38,734
Keep your hands out
of your pockets.

1521
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,360
Put them on the hood.

1522
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:41,319
Spread your legs.

1523
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:42,486
Anything sharp on you?

1524
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:43,697
Any knives or needles at all?

1525
01:36:11,433 --> 01:36:12,713
Bed's clear.

1526
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,227
Nothing will fit in there.

1527
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:20,233
So, uh, I'm done?

1528
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,400
We're done now?

1529
01:37:37,394 --> 01:37:39,074
How much does the MDEA

1530
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:40,814
know about what
they've been doing?

1531
01:37:40,981 --> 01:37:42,501
I mean, how much do
they know about us,

1532
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:45,151
what we did, you know?

1533
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:49,364
OK, we've got to...
we've got to go.

1534
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:50,198
We've got to go.

1535
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:51,074
We've got to get our money.

1536
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:52,993
We've got to go right now.

1537
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:54,202
Casper, we've got
to go right now!

1538
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:54,578
Come on.

1539
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:55,744
Fuck!

1540
01:38:15,849 --> 01:38:16,433
Grab the funds.

1541
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:17,600
Grab the money.

1542
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:47,631
"Dom?

1543
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:48,797
Dom!

1544
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:51,635
Dom, let's go.

1545
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:53,637
Dom!

1546
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:54,803
Come on, let's go.

1547
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:03,229
Fuck!

1548
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:05,190
Get the fuck out!

1549
01:39:05,357 --> 01:39:07,192
No!

1550
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:09,569
Dom!

1551
01:39:09,736 --> 01:39:12,197
Dom!

1552
01:39:22,248 --> 01:39:23,458
"No!

1553
01:39:57,784 --> 01:39:59,304
You all right, Dom?

1554
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:02,706
Coming for you!

1555
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:11,338
Dom!

1556
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:19,388
Dom?

1557
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,412
Here!

1558
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:43,705
Ugh, over here.

1559
01:41:55,235 --> 01:41:58,321
When I was about your age,
someone really close to me

1560
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:00,406
died.

1561
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:04,744
And, um, my mom picked me up
and drove me to the funeral.

1562
01:42:04,911 --> 01:42:08,123
And I couldn't cry, you know?

1563
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:09,969
I thought there was
something wrong with me

1564
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:13,336
because I couldn't cry.

1565
01:42:13,503 --> 01:42:16,923
I knew I missed him,
but I couldn't cry.

1566
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:20,552
And my mom said,
don't worry, it's OK.

1567
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:24,764
It's not a race.

1568
01:42:24,931 --> 01:42:25,931
There's no rush.

1569
01:42:25,974 --> 01:42:26,974
It'll come when it comes.

1570
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:37,110
And, uh, when I got to the
funeral, this guy I barely knew

1571
01:42:37,277 --> 01:42:39,028
put his arms around
me, hugged me.

1572
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:44,909
And he said, I
wish you long life.

1573
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:46,411
And I lost it.

1574
01:42:46,578 --> 01:42:49,789
I... I fell to pieces.

1575
01:42:49,956 --> 01:42:52,041
And I... I wish you long life.
