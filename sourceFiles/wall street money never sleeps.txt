1
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,100
One silk handkerchief.

2
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,810
One necktie.

3
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,570
One watch.

4
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,320
One ring.

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,450
One gold money clip with no money in it.

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,090
And one mobile phone.

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Fifty cents a day,
minus what you spent inside,

8
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,640
and a train ticket to the Big Apple.

9
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,350
Good luck, Gekko, and don't come back.

10
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,610
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>what the mother of all bubbles was?</i>

11
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,940
<i>lt came out of nowhere. By chance.</i>

12
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,650
-How many you got, Mac?
-Five.

13
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,410
<i>They called it the Cambrian Explosion.</i>

14
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,780
<i>lt happened around 530 million years ago.</i>

15
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,990
Open the gate!

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,580
<i>And over the next 70, 80 million years,</i>
<i>the rate of evolution accelerated so fast</i>

17
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,250
<i>that we came along.</i>

18
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,250
<i>The human race.</i>

19
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,840
<i>They still can't explain how that happened,</i>
<i>except that it happened.</i>

20
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,430
Here he is!

21
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Daddy!

22
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,000
<i>Some people say it was by chance,</i>

23
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,710
<i>others, design.</i>

24
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,550
<i>But who really knows?</i>

25
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,670
Stop sleeping.

26
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,510
You mean "wake up."

27
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,930
"Wake up" is positive.
"Stop sleeping" is a negative.

28
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,430
Either way,
it's not my favorite part of the day.

29
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,770
It's the best part of the day.

30
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,110
I feel bad for anybody who feels that way.
It means their day can't get any better.

31
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,860
You go to bed too late.
You don't sleep enough.

32
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,450
What's going on with you today?

33
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,700
Did I tell you, or did you forget?

34
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,710
I'm going to Washington for the week.

35
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah. New site, right?

36
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,710
We're launching in 10 days,

37
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,460
so the whole site's down
starting tomorrow.

38
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,380
What are all those angry liberals
going to do without their daily fix, baby?

39
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,800
You're just as liberal as they are,
Mr. Green Energy.

40
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,590
No, no, no.
The only green is money, honey.

41
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,510
You're so Wall Street, it makes me sick.

42
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,140
-Baby, come here.
-No. What did I ever see in you?

43
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,390
-Come here.
-No.

44
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,900
<i>My next guest, Gordon Gekko,</i>

45
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,440
<i>was one of the biggest names</i>
<i>on Wall Street in the '80s</i>

46
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,070
<i>before he went to prison</i>
<i>for insider trading and securities fraud.</i>

47
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,990
<i>He's out with a new book,</i>
<i>and it is a shocker, believe me.</i>

48
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,280
<i>lt is called</i> Is Greed Good?

49
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,240
<i>The man himself is here with us.</i>
<i>Gordon, good to have you on the program.</i>

50
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,910
<i>Thank you, Maria. lt's nice to be out.</i>

51
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,580
-Turn it off.
-One sec.

52
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,040
<i>And l must tell you,</i>
<i>your show is a big, big hit in the can.</i>

53
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,250
<i>You watched it in prison?</i>

54
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,380
<i>Your show?</i>

55
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,260
<i>Me and a whole lot of others.</i>

56
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,510
<i>You wrote the book in prison?</i>

57
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,840
<i>l did. l outlined my drafts...</i>

58
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,770
I'm taking a shower.

59
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,510
See you next week.

60
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,680
Good luck in Washington.

61
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,910
-Hello?
<i>-Jacob.</i>

62
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Dr. Masters.

63
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
Good morning, sir.
Don't you get any sleep?

64
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,960
Jacob, it happened.
As close as we've come to burn yet.

65
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,460
<i>Really? How many lasers?</i>

66
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,590
We fired 72 this morning,
and we're going to go for 96 next week.

67
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,430
That's fantastic.
That's a game changer, Doc.

68
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,640
So let me guess, it means we're pushing
the pace, right? You need more money?

69
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,980
Well, it'd be good
if we could get another $100 million.

70
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,350
We could pick up
maybe six months on our schedule.

71
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,190
A hundred million dollars?

72
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,360
As long as the price of oil stays high,
we'll get the money.

73
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,240
That would be nice. That would be nice.

74
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,120
Because The Foundation says that they're
having some problems in the markets...

75
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,160
You don't worry about that, though,
okay, Doc?

76
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,040
You just keep building
that baby star, okay?

77
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,710
<i>Okay. Thank you, Jacob. Thank you.</i>

78
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,000
All right, I'll talk to you soon.

79
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,710
Hydra Offshore.

80
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,380
Let me repeat this again.

81
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,420
A huge deep-sea exploration play
off the coast of Equatorial Guinea.

82
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,720
That's an oil field
that's barely been touched.

83
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,680
Remember, the stock's trading
roughly 31 % off the 52-week high

84
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,480
and it's part owned and funded
by none other than, guess who.

85
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,020
Churchill Schwartz.

86
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,560
So we know they won't let
anything too bad happen here.

87
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,860
My suggestion is that we get aggressive.

88
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,480
-Agreed?
-Yeah.

89
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,820
We all agree?

90
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,160
Ed, what do you think?

91
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,200
I don't agree. Maybe it's just me.

92
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,700
Equatorial Guinea's
a pretty tough dictatorship.

93
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,620
This guy's already nationalized
the gold and diamond mines.

94
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,750
So what's your point?

95
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,870
I just don't think it's a risk our desk

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,870
should be taking right now, that's all.
I'd wait.

97
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,130
-Wait? Wait for what?
-Yeah.

98
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,880
Your "Beam me up, Scottie"
hydrogen fusion deal?

99
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,710
Now you're talking about something else.
It's United Fusion Corporation, Stan.

100
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
Come on. It's apples and oranges.

101
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,010
-Really?
-Yeah.

102
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,800
You mean the deal that we already sank
$50 million into, Mr. Brainiac?

103
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,180
Alternative energy
is what biotech was 15 years ago, Stan.

104
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,680
Come on. You were young once.
You know that.

105
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,600
Profits aren't quarterly.
The runs could be huge.

106
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,480
We'll all be dead by the time
your nutty professor makes us any money.

107
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,730
Right, this coming from the guy
who said Google was a bubble.

108
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,860
Anyway. Hydra Offshore.

109
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,780
It's priced right for us to make
three to five times on our money.

110
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,160
And better yet, what we all love the most.

111
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,040
Big year-end bonuses.

112
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,920
Let's go! Let's go! Let's make some dough!

113
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,090
What's up? You good?

114
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,890
I can't! It's not up to me.

115
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,190
Maybe I can do it, maybe I can't do it.
People are telling me something.

116
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,030
Jesus! Harry, you gave me your word.

117
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,740
You know I know!

118
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,280
You okay, Lou?

119
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,660
Good day, I'm okay. Bad day, I'm okay.
What's the difference?

120
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,410
Do me a favor.
Don't ask me dumb questions.

121
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,000
You wanted to see me?

122
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
Steve, stay on top of Harry, okay?

123
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,340
-He's driving me crazy.
-You got it, boss.

124
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,170
Follow me.

125
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,600
Why?

126
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,020
That's some "Thank you."
What do you want, a kiss, too?

127
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,560
I thought maybe the news out of London
would've wrecked the mood.

128
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,810
London? Don't tell me London.

129
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,320
I take a look at their sheets. They tell me
they got a $125 million profit, right?

130
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,110
I look at the same lousy spread,

131
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,950
to me it looks like
a buck and a quarter loss.

132
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,620
Then they tell me, "Don't worry about it.
We're making money on the losses."

133
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,700
How do you make money on losses?
You tell me.

134
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,700
I'm just an old dinosaur.

135
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,830
Lou, I believe in Keller Zabel. We're fine.

136
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,120
And you're not a dinosaur. Come on.

137
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,580
It's no fun anymore, Jacob.

138
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,510
I'm talking to some guy
in Mumbai, Dumbai.

139
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,340
I don't know what he's talking about.

140
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,340
I don't know what he's selling,
I don't know who he is,

141
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,840
I don't know how much I'm putting up.

142
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,310
And my partners, they're in their graves.
They're laughing at me.

143
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,230
It's just a bunch of machines now,
telling us what to do.

144
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,730
That's why you got people like me here,
Lou, to lighten the load.

145
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,310
Getting old is not for sissies, kid.

146
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,740
Take that money, huh?

147
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,450
You spend it on that pretty girl.
You deserve it.

148
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,080
I remember when the pro sent me you.

149
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,830
This skinny kid with crazy hair.

150
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,840
I said, "Jimmy, what are you doing to me?
Give me a real caddy."

151
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,550
I was having a bad day,
and you wouldn't shut up.

152
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,630
Twelve years old,
you're talking to me about

153
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,800
companies and sectors and earnings.

154
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,810
You had the hunger, Jake.
I could smell it then. You still got it.

155
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,190
I've just never had a check like this
in my hands before.

156
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,650
You spend it. Somebody has to keep
our economy going.

157
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,280
Well, get out of my office.

158
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,290
Thank you.

159
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,220
Princess cut.

160
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,850
Platinum-banded, one and a half carat.

161
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,770
There's nothing quite like a ring...

162
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,230
Can you take me to the money room?

163
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,400
You mean the private client foyer?

164
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,360
That's it.

165
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,730
Olga from Russia, with love.

166
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,520
How are you?

167
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,650
Shots or champagne, guys?

168
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,960
She was scoping you for the kill, bro.
Perfect. An 1 1, man. Gisele time.

169
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,590
No. This is...

170
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,510
Wow. You're serious.

171
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Yeah.

172
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,600
So young, and already pricing yourself
off the market.

173
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,480
-'Tron?
-Shots.

174
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,070
So when are you gonna ask her?

175
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,030
She's not that crazy
about marriage, you know.

176
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,150
I mean, look at her parents.

177
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,570
A girl's got to get it straight with her pop,
don't you think?

178
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,070
-What if you have kids?
-Yeah, it's going be tough.

179
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,780
Did you hear what he said on TV
the other night?

180
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,910
"Home loan defaults are just the first
raindrop in the mother of all storms."

181
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,710
Christ. Sour grapes, this man.

182
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,420
The guy is a legend. Gordon the Gekko.

183
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,590
He's speaking next week
up at your old alma mater, Fordham.

184
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
Watch yourself.

185
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,510
-Hey buddy, get a cane.
-Come on, come on.

186
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,550
A few of us are going up after work
to check him out. Come along.

187
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,470
I can't. Winnie, you know.

188
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,060
The only God you worship is Zabel.

189
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,980
I don't worship the man.
He got me a seat at the table.

190
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,440
The word is he's stuck with a ton of toxic
sub-prime debt off the balance sheet.

191
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,440
Billions. Can't find a bid for it.

192
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,730
Yeah, so what?

193
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,610
So, buddy, it don't matter
if the rumors are true or not.

194
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,820
Because in this climate,
it's what buyers believe.

195
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,410
And where there's smoke, there's fire.

196
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,410
-I'll make you a bet right now.
-Go.

197
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,000
I got a million dollars
left of my bonus, okay?

198
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,790
It's yours tomorrow a.m.

199
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,080
You put it in KZI shares.
You leverage that to the max.

200
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,290
That's how much I believe
in this company.

201
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,750
Did you not hear me?

202
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,590
Listen, as your only friend left

203
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,760
from a place in Long Island no one can
remember, let alone pronounce,

204
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,130
I'm telling you,
you're acting like your mama.

205
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,390
Don't do that. Leave her out of this.

206
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,220
Plus, why would he spot-bonus me
right now if we were in trouble, huh?

207
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,390
It makes no sense.

208
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,600
Look, you don't want to
make any money on this, fine.

209
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,020
-I'm sure Harry Shapiro would love to.
-Okay, okay.

210
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,190
I'm a hooker, too. Send it to me.

211
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,690
You're still young enough to recover.

212
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,950
I'll ream you on the commission.

213
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,120
I'm gonna love the look on your face
when I make so much money off this.

214
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,910
I'll have no choice but to walk away.

215
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,290
<i>Guys, we're looking</i>
<i>at an unprecedented meltdown here.</i>

216
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,880
<i>I've never seen anything like it...</i>

217
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,130
<i>Keller Zabel's loss today</i>
<i>was the worst in over a year.</i>

218
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,550
<i>And this big drop may be</i>
<i>just the beginning</i>

219
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,760
<i>of a much deeper correction.</i>

220
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,600
<i>lt is an amazing story.</i>
<i>Keller Zabel stock is getting hammered.</i>

221
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,560
<i>How is it you've never been more wrong</i>
<i>in your life than right now?</i>

222
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,980
<i>You're losing all your money right now.</i>
<i>l see it, it's going down.</i>

223
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,440
<i>Somebody is betting big money</i>
<i>that Zabel's stock is about to collapse.</i>

224
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,610
<i>You wanna owe?</i>

225
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,610
This stock's about to lose
its bar mitzvah, Jake.

226
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,610
Take the haircut and sell.
You're on a 50% margin, buddy.

227
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,860
I can still get you out now
at a total loss, but at least you won't owe.

228
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,700
<i>...threatening the firm's liquidity.</i>

229
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,540
<i>In one incredible week, shares of KZl</i>
<i>are down 52%.</i>

230
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,750
I know where the stock is.
I have it in front of me.

231
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,870
What you got to do right now is relax,
take a deep breath.

232
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,830
Tell your banks not to sell the stock.

233
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,130
The stock is overreacting right now and...

234
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,630
Hey, what financial stock isn't, right?

235
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,130
Listen, three months from now
we're going to look back on this and laugh.

236
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,340
You're angry? I'm angry.

237
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,510
Okay! We're okay.

238
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,890
-Relax.
-Relax.

239
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,560
Jesus Christ.

240
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,430
<i>I've known you your whole life, Jake.</i>

241
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,640
And I know when you're lying to yourself.

242
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,650
Robby, listen to me.
Keller Zabel's been around a long time.

243
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,480
All right? It's one of the great names
in investment banking.

244
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,650
A month, a year, it doesn't matter.
We'll be back to 65/70, and I'll be fine.

245
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,240
You just gotta hold it, okay?

246
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,070
You're gonna owe, you know.

247
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,660
Not just the buck, but the margin, too.
We're talking another...

248
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,950
Tell me.

249
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,750
You don't want to hear this today.

250
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,080
Robby.

251
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,580
How much?

252
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,000
<i>At least another half a buck.</i>

253
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,840
<i>Give me the okay to sell, buddy.</i>

254
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,550
<i>Right now.</i>

255
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,840
<i>Sell. Sell!</i>

256
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,390
Robby, I got to call you later.

257
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,560
Have you seen Zabel?

258
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,230
Annica, where's Lou?

259
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,240
Not in. Not answering.

260
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,870
Not happy.

261
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,830
Hey.

262
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,250
Lou.

263
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,590
Hey, Lou. How's your day going?

264
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,890
I told you. Good day, I'm okay.
Bad day, I'm okay.

265
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,970
Stop bugging me on my feelings.
They're irrelevant.

266
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,270
I wanted to come see you face to face
and talk about these rumors, you know.

267
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,940
Because it's getting crazy.
It's out of control now.

268
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,230
I'm hearing it from all ends.

269
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,360
Our world is all bullshit.

270
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,320
Some TV bubblehead, he gets up there
like he knows something.

271
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,950
He sells fear, panic.

272
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
And morons, they love it.

273
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,080
They want it to end because it sells.

274
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,330
There's no limits anymore.

275
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,210
Muriel knows how to walk this thing.
It's her damn dog.

276
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,250
Lou, I can help. I can get
to the bottom of these derivatives.

277
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,750
You just got to tell me.

278
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,380
There's so much you don't know, Jacob.

279
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,220
What? What about the bonus thing?
Why now?

280
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,300
Because I know you.
You're holding out for something better.

281
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,810
Well, don't. Spend it. Use the money.

282
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,890
Because one day, you're gonna wake up
and you're gonna be dead.

283
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,640
Lou, you got to get yourself together,
all right?

284
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,940
We're gonna be fine.

285
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,900
No matter how bad this thing gets,
we have real equity in this company.

286
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,150
We're gonna get through this.

287
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,730
Marry Gekko's daughter.

288
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,780
Make some kids with her.

289
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,950
And you spend as much time as you can
with those kids when they're young

290
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,080
because everything changes. Everything.

291
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,120
I cannot help you if I don't understand
what you are talking about.

292
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,960
There's 15,000 jobs on the line right now.

293
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,290
Somebody's after us, right?
Somebody's trying to hurt us.

294
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,630
There's a reason this is happening.
I need to know how and why.

295
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,010
You know that dream you got about
that little energy company in California?

296
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,260
You may not get there,
but you hold on to that.

297
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,800
Because everything else is just noise.

298
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,720
It's not just noise.
There's 15,000 jobs on the line.

299
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,430
Fifteen thousand people here.
That's not noise.

300
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,640
-Are we going under?
-I never liked this damn dog.

301
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,730
Louis, are we going under?

302
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,530
You're asking the wrong question, Jacob.

303
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,240
What's the right question?

304
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,990
Who isn't?

305
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,850
China's out.

306
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,650
You said...

307
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,730
I know what I said, Bill.

308
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,280
Two months we negotiated
with these pikers.

309
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,650
They pulled out at 7:00 p.m.

310
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,490
So what's new? They're Chinese.

311
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,490
And while they were negotiating,
we lost the Koreans.

312
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,330
So you're saying you don't have an out.

313
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,920
No, I'm saying, just give me one week.

314
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,960
We're still talking to the British.
And the Arabs are back in,

315
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,010
and this time it's for real.

316
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,170
<i>Lou, we've heard this before.</i>

317
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,220
Jesus. Paul, we lost billions this week.

318
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,680
If the markets don't roll over our paper
Sunday night, before Asia opens,

319
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,640
Keller Zabel cannot do business
on Monday.

320
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,560
Tuesday, 15,000 people are gonna be
out of a job, worldwide!

321
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,400
Lou, you understated the scale
of your bad loans.

322
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,860
Your valuations are no longer believable.

323
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,330
After all these years,

324
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,120
you say this to me?

325
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,120
Me?

326
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,040
Three-quarters of the banking houses
at this table

327
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,920
are holding the same paper,
and you're gonna let Keller Zabel fail?

328
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,220
You're all committing suicide.

329
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,850
What do you say, Harry?
Will you come in on this?

330
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,730
Look, if you want us
to bail out Keller Zabel,

331
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,480
all of us will have to participate.

332
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,730
Like Long-Term Capital, '98.

333
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,110
And we will need substantial guarantees
from the US Treasury.

334
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,200
Bill, I think we should talk privately.

335
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,450
<i>l think that's a good idea, Bill.</i>

336
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,330
Gentlemen, give us a minute.

337
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,750
What about moral hazard, Jack?

338
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,130
We bail out Keller Zabel, who's to say
it's not gonna happen again and again?

339
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,090
You vindictive bastard.

340
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,640
Who are you to talk about moral hazard?

341
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I'm sorry, Lou.

342
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,220
The Street needs to make a statement
here to the world.

343
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,850
It was eight years ago!

344
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,650
You just can't let it go, can you, Bretton?

345
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,690
All right, Lou, knock it off.

346
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,030
I'd like to speak with you, Bill. Jack.

347
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,990
And Lou.

348
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,120
Separately.

349
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,040
Thirty of our people

350
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,620
have been through the Keller Zabel books
for the last three days.

351
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,040
And they still say it's impossible
to get to the bottom of this.

352
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,260
This could be a 10-billion dollar hole for us.

353
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,640
Or it could be a 200-billion dollar hole
and there's no way we can risk that money

354
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,850
without a backstop
from Treasury or the Fed.

355
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,010
You started this, didn't you, Bretton?

356
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,230
I said knock it off, Lou.
Or this meeting is over, you hear me?

357
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,440
You're asking us
to take a large risk here, Bretton.

358
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,610
What are you offering?

359
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,150
Under these conditions, and assuming

360
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,320
you refine your guarantee,

361
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,620
Jack, Julie and I, and our partners
who have been consulted,

362
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,910
are prepared to risk $2 a share.

363
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,540
Two bucks?

364
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,550
Jesus. You're out of your mind.

365
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,800
The stock was trading at 79 a month ago!

366
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,640
Our building alone is worth more
than two bucks a share.

367
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,220
Julie.

368
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,600
If only we had more time, Lou.

369
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,810
My board will never accept this.

370
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,940
There is no way I'm gonna sell
for two bucks a share.

371
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,690
The government, if we guarantee this deal,

372
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,030
could never justify a high price
for your company.

373
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,190
And if you don't sell, Lou,
you're in bankruptcy.

374
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,780
This is a public spectacle now.

375
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,870
No, it's a public execution,
and you'll be leading it, Bill.

376
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,290
I built this company.

377
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,500
And your exit will help restore faith in it.

378
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,830
Who the hell are you to tell me to get out?

379
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,380
You're out, Lou!
One way or the other, you're out.

380
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Then the hell with you!

381
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,800
I'll take my chances in bankruptcy court
before I sell to that barracuda.

382
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,610
Then we have nothing more to talk about.

383
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,370
Six.

384
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,870
Three, and that's it.
If I can sell it to the board.

385
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Five.

386
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,250
-Three.
-All right.

387
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,710
We'll call it an even four,
so it don't look so goddamn pathetic.

388
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,850
Three.

389
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,190
And not a dime more.

390
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,250
<i>We have breaking news right now.</i>

391
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,040
<i>Earlier this morning</i>
<i>in a New York City subway,</i>

392
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,000
<i>Keller Zabel managing partner</i>

393
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,840
<i>and head of one of the biggest</i>
<i>investment firms on Wall Street,</i>

394
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,130
<i>Louis Zabel, 75,</i>

395
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,720
<i>apparently jumped</i>
<i>in front of an oncoming train</i>

396
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,640
<i>in front of hundreds of bystanders.</i>

397
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,430
<i>The stock is currently halted,</i>
<i>pending news...</i>

398
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,060
<i>Churchill Schwartz is making out</i>
<i>like a bandit right now</i>

399
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
<i>with government funding.</i>

400
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,100
<i>But Keller Zabel as an independent</i>
<i>investment bank is essentially finished.</i>

401
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,730
<i>Tom, this news about Louis Zabel today</i>

402
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,570
<i>comes as a shock to everyone.</i>
<i>But how are you holding up there?</i>

403
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,740
<i>The guy was an icon on Wall Street.</i>

404
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,110
<i>l always thought of him</i>
<i>as sort of a mentor to me.</i>

405
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,200
<i>So to see this happen under</i>
<i>the circumstances that it did happen,</i>

406
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,490
<i>it's devastating.</i>

407
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,580
<i>What's it mean to the employees</i>
<i>at Keller Zabel?</i>

408
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,710
<i>l think they've lost their leader.</i>
<i>They're going to be...</i>

409
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,210
<i>Frankly, financially,</i>
<i>a lot of them are gonna be badly hurt.</i>

410
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,800
<i>This is gonna hurt on so many fronts.</i>

411
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,470
<i>l know it's still difficult to think about it</i>
<i>with this news just coming out about Louis</i>

412
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,140
<i>but you have to wonder what this means</i>
<i>for the future of Wall Street.</i>

413
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,970
<i>Another firm gone, it leaves very</i>
<i>few players left on the Street.</i>

414
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,390
<i>One thing l know for sure is</i>

415
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,850
<i>more competition</i>
<i>is better than less competition.</i>

416
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,150
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

417
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,160
Will you marry me, Winnie?

418
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,090
Will you marry me?

419
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,600
What's wrong?

420
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,940
It's just something Lou said
about not waiting, you know?

421
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,400
And I love you.

422
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,200
Yes.

423
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,160
Yes?

424
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,880
You know, I should tell you due diligence.
There's some...

425
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,220
I'm out of a job and probably
on the other side of broke, you know.

426
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,970
Awesome.

427
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,330
<i>In one of the harshest sentences</i>
<i>ever given</i>

428
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,250
<i>to a white collar criminal at that time,</i>
<i>in 1993,</i>

429
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,710
<i>he was sent off to Otis Federal Prison</i>
<i>for almost eight years.</i>

430
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,590
<i>And so, here in person, l welcome</i>
<i>the man himself, Mr. insider,</i>

431
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,130
<i>Gordon Gekko.</i>

432
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,850
Thank you.

433
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,910
<i>You're all pretty much fucked.</i>

434
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,250
<i>You don't know it yet,</i>

435
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,670
<i>but you're the NINJA generation.</i>

436
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,170
<i>No income.</i>

437
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,300
<i>No job.</i>

438
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,380
<i>No assets.</i>

439
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,640
<i>You got a lot to look forward to.</i>

440
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,520
Blood, buddy. He's gonna be your blood.

441
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,100
<i>Someone reminded me the other evening</i>

442
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,400
<i>that l once said, "Greed is good. "</i>

443
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,610
<i>Now it seems it's legal.</i>

444
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,950
<i>But, folks,</i>

445
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,870
<i>it's greed that makes my bartender</i>
<i>buy three houses he can't afford</i>

446
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,660
<i>with no money down.</i>

447
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:32,920
<i>And it's greed that makes your parents</i>
<i>refinance their $200,000 house for 250.</i>

448
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,840
<i>And then they take that extra 50</i>
<i>and they go down to the mall.</i>

449
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,550
<i>And they buy a plasma TV, cell phones,</i>

450
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,970
<i>computers, an SUV. And hey,</i>

451
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,230
<i>why not a second home while we're at it?</i>
<i>Because, gee whiz,</i>

452
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,650
<i>we all know that prices of houses</i>
<i>in America always go up, right?</i>

453
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,780
<i>lt's greed that makes</i>
<i>the government in this country</i>

454
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,570
<i>cut the interest rates</i>
<i>to one-percent, after 9/ 1 1.</i>

455
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,080
<i>So we could all go shopping again.</i>

456
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,750
<i>They got all these fancy names</i>
<i>for trillions of dollars of credit.</i>

457
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,920
<i>CMOs, CDOs, SlVs, ABSs.</i>

458
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,000
<i>l honestly think there's may be</i>
<i>only 75 people in the world</i>

459
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,920
<i>who know what they are.</i>

460
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,630
<i>But I'll tell you what they are.</i>

461
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,850
<i>They're WMDs. Weapons of</i>
<i>Mass Destruction. That's what they are.</i>

462
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,520
<i>When l was away,</i>
<i>it seemed like greed got greedier</i>

463
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,190
<i>with a little bit of envy mixed in.</i>

464
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,030
<i>Hedge funders were walking home</i>
<i>with 50, 100 million bucks a year.</i>

465
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,860
<i>So Mr. Banker, he's looks around,</i>
<i>and he says, "My life looks pretty boring. "</i>

466
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,790
<i>So he starts leveraging his interests</i>
<i>up to 40, 50 to one</i>

467
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,540
<i>with your money.</i>

468
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,620
<i>Not his, yours.</i>

469
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,250
<i>Because he could.</i>

470
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,420
<i>You're supposed to be borrowing,</i>
<i>not them.</i>

471
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,510
<i>And the beauty of the deal,</i>

472
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,010
<i>no one is responsible.</i>

473
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,100
<i>Because everybody's drinking</i>
<i>the same Kool-Aid.</i>

474
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,470
<i>Last year, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

475
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,270
<i>forty percent</i>
<i>of all American corporate profits</i>

476
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,310
<i>came from financial services.</i>

477
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,730
<i>Not production,</i>

478
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,480
<i>not anything remotely to do</i>
<i>with the needs of the American public.</i>

479
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,740
<i>The truth is, we're all part of it now.</i>

480
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,580
<i>Banks, consumers,</i>
<i>we're moving money around in circles.</i>

481
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,660
<i>We take a buck,</i>

482
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,580
<i>we shoot it full of steroids,</i>
<i>and we call it "leverage. "</i>

483
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,540
<i>l call it "steroid banking. "</i>

484
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,010
<i>I've been considered a pretty smart guy</i>
<i>when it comes to finance.</i>

485
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,170
That was fantastic, man.

486
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,550
<i>And maybe l was in prison too long.</i>

487
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,390
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>it's the only place to stay sane</i>

488
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,310
<i>and look out through those bars and say,</i>

489
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,850
<i>"Hey! ls everybody out there nuts?"</i>

490
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,440
<i>lt's clear as a bell</i>
<i>to those that pay attention.</i>

491
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,530
<i>The mother of all evil is speculation.</i>

492
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,540
<i>Leveraged debt.</i>

493
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,330
<i>Bottom line.</i>

494
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,330
<i>lt's borrowing to the hilt.</i>

495
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,050
<i>And l hate to tell you this,</i>

496
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,470
<i>but it's a bankrupt business model.</i>
<i>lt won't work.</i>

497
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,680
<i>lt's systemic, malignant, and it's global.</i>

498
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,140
<i>Like cancer.</i>

499
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,190
<i>lt's a disease, and we got to fight back.</i>

500
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,440
<i>How are we gonna do that?</i>

501
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,650
<i>How are we gonna leverage</i>
<i>that disease back in our favor?</i>

502
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,160
<i>Well, I'll tell you.</i>

503
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,950
<i>Three words.</i>

504
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,250
<i>Buy my book.</i>

505
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,170
<i>Prices and profits work.</i>

506
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,090
This is the kind of energy we need
out there. You just keep it up.

507
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,470
Mr. Gekko!

508
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,720
-Excuse me for a moment, sir.
-Q and A's over, all right?

509
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,390
Buy the book. There's no more free advice.

510
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,020
My name is Jacob Moore.
I'm gonna marry your daughter.

511
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,030
Does she know that?

512
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,200
She pretended to.

513
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,910
All right, I'll give you 10 minutes.

514
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,580
I'm a prop trader at Keller Zabel.
I specialize in energy with a focus on...

515
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,250
Sorry about Lou.

516
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,920
One of the toughest guys
that ever wore shoes.

517
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,380
But when those rumors start...

518
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,590
Yeah. I wish I knew who started this.

519
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,760
I loved him very much.

520
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,130
Like a father.

521
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,260
He got me a scholarship here at Fordham
and hired me right out of business school.

522
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,470
Well, no one else in this market's
had the balls to commit suicide.

523
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,020
It's an honorable thing to do.

524
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,650
Mr. Gekko, I'm in love with your daughter.

525
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,360
And I'd be honored...

526
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,110
Why is that funny?

527
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,660
My daughter hasn't spoken to me in years,
and you know it.

528
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,240
She blames me for her brother's overdose

529
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,450
and just about every other disaster
that's hit this world

530
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,200
since Nintendo.

531
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,460
You don't think it's strange that she's
dating somebody from Wall Street?

532
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,290
-Why?
-Because she hates it.

533
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,090
You don't think it's funny
that she'd fall in love with you?

534
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,180
I bet you don't have one of these.

535
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,390
No. Can I see that?

536
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,520
Yeah.

537
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,560
It's when she was eight.

538
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,480
Can I have a copy of it? She doesn't keep
pictures from her childhood.

539
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,820
I don't even know you, you already
want something from me, huh?

540
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,440
So what do I get in return?

541
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,820
Don't you want to make a trade?

542
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,740
Yeah, okay. All right.

543
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,870
I'll give you this and you give me
another picture of Winnie.

544
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,330
Recent, without you in it.

545
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,040
I don't have one on me.

546
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,080
I guess this is on margin, huh?

547
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,090
It's always been energy.

548
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,130
I've been specializing more and more
in clean tech.

549
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,550
It's sort of a passion now.

550
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,180
That's smart. That's the next bubble.

551
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,890
What are you,
some kind of energy freedom-fighter?

552
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,690
No, Mr. Gekko. I'm in this game
to make money like anybody else.

553
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,690
So what about money, Jake?

554
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,940
You like her?

555
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,480
Do I like...

556
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,110
I've never thought about money as a "she."

557
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,450
She lies there in bed at night with you,

558
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,620
looking at you, one eye open.

559
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,370
Money's a bitch that never sleeps.

560
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,790
And she's jealous.

561
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,170
And if you don't pay close attention,

562
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,630
you wake up in the morning,
and she might be gone forever.

563
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,890
Respectfully,

564
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,510
Mr. Gekko, I don't want to end up
where you are because of money.

565
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Oh, yeah. So marry it instead, right?

566
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,100
What do you mean?

567
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,400
Winnie doesn't have any money.

568
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,820
Right.

569
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,990
Here I thought you were a gold-digger.

570
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,490
Does Winnie know you came to see me?

571
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,910
No.

572
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,370
Well, not exactly. I was gonna tell her.

573
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,340
I don't think that's a good idea, pal.

574
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,630
See, I got a feeling
you may want to be seeing me again

575
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,170
and if she knew
we had this little pow-wow,

576
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,760
she's not gonna let it happen.

577
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,310
You know what? You're a smart kid.

578
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,640
You should just walk away.
You never met me.

579
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,230
I don't understand.

580
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,520
I think...

581
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,110
The man that you loved like a father
who threw himself under a subway?

582
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,940
I think you're angrier
than you think you are.

583
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,030
And I think you wanna be
in the family business.

584
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,150
Which is what?

585
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,490
Payback.

586
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,120
Except I'm not in that business anymore.

587
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,910
Because the one thing I learned in jail

588
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,290
is that money is not the prime asset in life.

589
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,460
Time is.

590
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,040
And your time is just about up.

591
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,550
Winnie needs to get past the pain
you caused her.

592
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,340
I caused her?

593
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,550
Look, she wants you back in her life.

594
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,470
She just can't handle it right now.

595
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,510
Okay? Maybe I can help.

596
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,020
Maybe you can, maybe you can.
That's what makes the market, Jake.

597
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,810
This is my station.

598
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,190
That is my email address.

599
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,740
By the way, the rumors on Zabel?

600
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,990
Yeah?

601
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,410
It had to be someone
with enough clout to be believed,

602
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,250
somebody who made a fortune
shorting the stock.

603
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,250
An axe to grind.

604
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,050
Word has it that Bretton James
gutted Zabel at the Fed.

605
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,130
Just stuck that knife
right into his stomach.

606
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,980
Check out 2000.

607
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,770
The Internet bubble.

608
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,150
Churchill Schwartz, they got hosed.

609
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,980
You know there's fortunes to be made.

610
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,530
Hundreds of millions of dollars
betting against this bubble.

611
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,110
Just wish I had a million.

612
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,460
It checks out, baby.

613
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:32,130
Thirteen banks were approached
in 2000 to rescue Churchill Schwartz.

614
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,710
Bretton James' division was over-invested
in the Internet bubble collapse.

615
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,220
Each bank was going to put up
100 million, but Zabel said no.

616
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,680
Churchill Schwartz almost went down

617
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,470
but was backstopped
by a conglomerate of nine banks.

618
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,600
Okay, so not only did they survive this,

619
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,770
but they came back
and ate our fricking lunch.

620
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,890
Moral hazard.

621
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,650
-Unbelievable.
-The man's a hypocrite.

622
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,070
Jacob Moore.

623
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,570
<i>-Hey, Jake.</i>
-Hey, Doc.

624
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,610
I don't know, Jake. We're on hold here.
Now they're telling me...

625
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,820
Hold on just a second.
Hold on just a second.

626
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,240
-I'll see you. We'll have drinks.
-Okay.

627
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,160
-It's not over. All right, Olaf?
-Thank you.

628
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,330
Go ahead, Doc.

629
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,910
They're telling me we have to cut staff.

630
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,840
We went back to Third Boston,
and they turned us down.

631
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,670
<i>And since your firm...</i>

632
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,380
Listen, I totally understand, okay?

633
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,930
But I think I can keep this thing going
with minimal cutbacks.

634
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,050
<i>Look, Jake.</i>

635
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,180
I think we have to have a face-to-face talk
with my people, because...

636
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,310
I totally agree, Doc.

637
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,600
It's just that I'm walking into
a critical meeting right now. Okay?

638
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,440
But I'll definitely have it on your desk
tomorrow a.m., okay?

639
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,610
-Okay.
-Okay.

640
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,020
Robby, what do you got?

641
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,230
We got movement definitely
on Tuesday of that week.

642
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,280
There was some large shorts
from money out of the Cayman Islands.

643
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,700
Something called Locust Fund.

644
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,950
Locust Fund.

645
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,070
What else?

646
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,160
Wednesday, they traded
another 500,000 shares.

647
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,450
Monday, two million.

648
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,790
Tuesday, one million more.
Total of 3.5 million shares.

649
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,040
These guys made some serious money.

650
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,710
Who is that, though?
Who is the Locust Fund?

651
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,210
I don't know. And I don't want to find out.
It could be my ass.

652
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,130
It'll be your ass if I tell your girlfriend
about the pumps and heels.

653
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,260
Which girlfriend?

654
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,260
Just find out, all right? I got a hunch.

655
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,140
<i>l hope it's better than your last one.</i>

656
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,850
Do I hear revenge here?

657
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,100
It's a dish you stick to cold, pal.

658
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,480
I'm about to serve it up hot, Robby.

659
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,530
I told you. Guinea's pulling the plug.

660
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,740
This dictator, Ojukwa,
he says Western bankers are greedy.

661
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,530
-What else is new?
-Listen. Okay?

662
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,450
You will not lose on this. Not on this.

663
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,120
Look, if there's one thing I know,
it's energy,

664
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,290
and that the Church
is gonna get hit on this.

665
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,040
Is this true?

666
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,760
Oh, yeah.
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.

667
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,430
He's definitely gonna nationalize the oil.
I promise you.

668
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:44,930
Are you behind it?

669
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,220
No. Churchill Schwartz is.
They got a huge stake.

670
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,100
Can't get behind that size,
but you and your boys can.

671
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,850
You should.

672
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,390
All I'm asking

673
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,940
is you rent me this beautiful thing
for the weekend, and we're good.

674
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,270
Deal?

675
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,940
Deal. Super deal.

676
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,580
Can he just take over the oil like that?

677
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,620
The guy's out of his mind.
He's talking to witch doctors.

678
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,750
He's gonna murder the stock.

679
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,580
I know. That's why you gotta get in.

680
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,510
Jake, that company, Offshore African Oil...

681
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,970
Yeah. Hydra Offshore.

682
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:27,390
And you're saying
Churchill Schwartz is a part of it?

683
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,140
Over here is gonna be
the most expensive item by tomorrow.

684
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,980
It's Alice, in Wonderland.

685
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,520
Churchill Schwartz
has a huge position in this thing.

686
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,690
I want to get short that stock.

687
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,190
Churchill Schwartz is behind that?

688
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,990
It's just a rumor. It might take a hit.

689
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,660
Hear about that African deal?

690
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,540
Yeah, I heard they're gonna nationalize.

691
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,710
Churchill Schwartz! Off the floor!

692
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,130
They're creating rumors
around the Hydra position.

693
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,500
None of it's true.
They're just trying to kill the stock.

694
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,800
<i>Doesn't make any difference</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

695
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,300
<i>Then start another</i>
<i>goddamn rumor is what you do.</i>

696
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,090
<i>...short quickly and quietly</i>
<i>without everyone figuring out...</i>

697
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,550
I'm convinced what they're after
is Churchill,

698
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,180
which has a big position in this stock

699
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,430
because Churchill got
the sweetheart deal on Keller Zabel.

700
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,350
Churchill Schwartz has
a five-percent position in it.

701
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,610
Who knows? Who's got the inside line on
some tin-pot dictator in Africa?

702
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,080
<i>House of pain.</i>

703
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,450
<i>The house of pain!</i>

704
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,290
<i>Hydra Offshore got taken</i>
<i>to the woodshed today.</i>

705
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,040
<i>This one's getting beaten</i>
<i>like a redhead stepchild.</i>

706
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,260
<i>Down a quick 19%</i>
<i>on rumors of oil nationalization...</i>

707
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,050
<i>No, no!</i>

708
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,260
<i>...in Equatorial Guinea.</i>
<i>There's a country for you.</i>

709
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,390
Get them.

710
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:51,510
<i>The shockwave from this one</i>

711
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,180
<i>extended all the way</i>
<i>to investment bank Churchill Schwartz.</i>

712
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,640
<i>Churchill Schwartz down eight percent</i>
<i>in pre-market trading.</i>

713
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,610
<i>Home builder confidence falls</i>
<i>to a record low in July.</i>

714
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:06,490
<i>The monthly indicator from the</i>
<i>National Association of Homebuilders</i>

715
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,570
<i>dropped for a third consecutive month...</i>

716
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,280
You got your high ceilings.

717
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,410
Bonus playroom upstairs,
not that I'm rushing you.

718
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,250
Here.

719
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,750
This is going to be the sun room.
Perfect for reading.

720
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,290
It'll get great light.

721
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,050
And there's plenty of room for a pool

722
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,130
or a tennis court. See?

723
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,050
What's going on with Rainwater Road, Ma?

724
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,600
I'm showing it tomorrow.

725
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,010
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

726
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,430
Sylvia, I think it's lovely.

727
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
Long Island always goes up.

728
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,610
Great schools, great shopping,
lots of doctors.

729
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,520
Everybody loves it here.

730
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,650
You ought to buy it.

731
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,650
There are quite a few choices
on this block.

732
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,160
That's what I love about you, dear.
You call it like you see it.

733
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,580
I'd rather have this down payment any day.

734
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,080
Ma, you got three properties.

735
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,830
Two of the loans are resetting
in a few months.

736
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,210
You got to sell at least one.

737
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,090
Don't tell me my job, Jacob.
There are no buyers out there right now.

738
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,300
The market's soft.
Everybody reads the same news.

739
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,050
I just gotta wait it out.

740
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,430
It's like the two Florida properties
five years ago.

741
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,350
I didn't get spooked,
and I flipped 190 grand from them.

742
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,020
What does Henry say?

743
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,520
Oh, Henry. Forget about him. He's a wimp.

744
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,770
That's done?

745
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,820
If I listened to Henry, I would have sold
every house way too soon.

746
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,860
He's just like your father was.

747
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,240
No. Dad had bad luck.

748
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,120
He took a shot and he failed.
But he took a shot, Ma.

749
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,580
Yeah, and then Jack Daniels took his shot,
and he succeeded.

750
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,250
Can we not have an argument about
my father every time I come to see you?

751
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,960
So sensitive. Forget I said anything.

752
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,460
God. Defending your father
is like defending smallpox.

753
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,710
Look.

754
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,850
The developers are on my ass, okay?
I just need you to bridge me.

755
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,140
What about the money
from Sagamir Road?

756
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:02,100
What do you think?
I put it into the new properties.

757
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,600
What did you think,
it was just gonna shoot up in perpetuity?

758
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,060
Don't patronize your mother,
Jacob Lawrence.

759
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,980
Of course I know the risks involved.

760
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,150
Hey, you're buying diamonds.
You got the bonus, right?

761
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,910
I remember visiting you when I was young
at the hospital after school, thinking,

762
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:18,410
"How cool is this?
My mother is saving lives."

763
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,490
-Don't change the subject.
-I'm not changing the subject.

764
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,160
I never saved any lives.

765
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,160
Yeah, but you did something,
and that's the point, Mom.

766
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,000
I make more in a month now
than I did in my best year as a nurse.

767
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,710
You made a difference.

768
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,720
Listen to the broker
preaching making a difference.

769
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,380
That's ironic.

770
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,970
How much?

771
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,520
Two hundred, tops.

772
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,100
You're killing me, Ma!

773
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,270
I'll wire it to you.

774
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,110
Can you stop, please?

775
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,450
You're not doing her any favors.

776
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,280
I know.

777
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,950
And you're not preventing it
from happening again.

778
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,250
I'll shut up.

779
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,960
-Yeah?
<i>-Guess what?</i>

780
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,470
Your boy, Bretton James?

781
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,590
His assistant just called me and asked
if you can see him today.

782
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,720
You're kidding me.

783
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:21,970
Jake, you have an hour.
I told him you were on the island.

784
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,890
Yeah, but I'm in the middle
of Friday afternoon traffic.

785
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,850
But he said after hours is okay,
because he left his home address.

786
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,690
East 65th Street and Park Avenue, honey.
Up to 8 p.m.

787
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,820
Did he sound upset?

788
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,730
Screw him, he destroyed this company.

789
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,490
You waltz in there
like Russell Crowe in <i>Gladiator.</i>

790
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:37,780
Thanks, babe.

791
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,910
Sounds like you're getting
your walking papers.

792
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,910
Jake, look, I don't need this ring now.

793
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,920
Just give me one
out of a Cracker Jack box instead...

794
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,460
What are you talking about?

795
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,210
Are you crazy? Everything's gonna be fine.

796
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,760
Jake, I grew up with a father
who only talked about money.

797
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,010
If you think I want to be
with the kind of guy

798
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,760
with his ego invested in his bank account,

799
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,880
you really don't get me.

800
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,470
"I love it, " was what I was expecting.

801
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,600
Return it. It makes me uncomfortable.

802
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,520
Okay, Winnie. I'll return it.

803
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,870
Jacob Moore to see Mr. James.

804
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,870
He's expecting you.

805
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,320
<i>Saturno Devorando A Su Hijo.</i>

806
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,030
Goya painted 15 Black Paintings
late in his life.

807
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,410
Fourteen of them are on view in the Prado.

808
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,660
That's the missing 15th.

809
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:10,120
An early sketch
for Saturn devouring his son.

810
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,880
Do you collect?

811
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,210
No.

812
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,170
Only the obsessive-compulsive
and the insecurely egotistical

813
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,010
feel the need to collect things.

814
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,100
Do you ride?

815
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,560
It's an avocation, yes.

816
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,520
You know the photograph.

817
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,360
Rollie Free, 1948.

818
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,610
He set the world record at 150.

819
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,240
And wanted it so bad he rode naked.

820
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,030
Why, you ride, Mr. Moore?

821
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,910
I'll put it to you this way.

822
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,330
If you rode the rest of your life, right,

823
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,670
and really became the best
that you could be,

824
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,170
you would never ride like I ride.

825
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,380
Well, then I look forward
to us riding together.

826
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,980
You a bee, Mr. Moore?

827
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,190
A what?

828
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,900
Do you like to sting people?

829
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,740
You cost Churchill Schwartz $120 million
last week.

830
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,620
That's not a great deal of money.

831
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,080
But people know Hydra Offshore is ours.

832
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:46,300
I had dinner with the good
Commander Ojukwa in Paris last week.

833
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:50,680
He has no actual plans
of nationalizing any oil fields.

834
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,930
But I guess
that doesn't really matter to you.

835
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,060
No, it doesn't.

836
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,150
I checked you out with the desks in town.

837
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:00,230
You didn't make any money off it.

838
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,860
No, I didn't.

839
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,400
Then why?

840
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,990
Because you destroyed my firm.

841
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,120
Your firm destroyed itself.

842
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,530
You killed Louis Zabel.

843
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,160
Louis Zabel killed himself.

844
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,290
But you set the rumors.

845
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,410
The rumors were true.

846
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,670
You made them true.

847
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,420
No, Mr. Moore.

848
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,840
Putting 50% leverage
on toxic debt made them true.

849
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,590
Look, Zabel once knew how to run money.

850
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,680
Dying because of it was his choice.

851
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,470
As far as I'm concerned, it's just money.

852
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,060
But when you don't know
what you're doing,

853
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,980
it's fatal, Mr. Moore.

854
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,310
Not knowing what you're doing.

855
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,650
Come work for me.

856
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,200
What?

857
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,160
We fund most of the world's
integrated oil companies,

858
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,040
drillers, coal producers,
natural gas line providers...

859
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,660
I know who you are.

860
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,620
But where we're a little light

861
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,290
is in alternative energy.

862
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,090
Why me?

863
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,430
Because your loyalty demanded revenge.

864
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,220
Your balls actually attempted it,
and your skill pulled it off.

865
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,600
And frankly,

866
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,400
because I'd love to
beat the crap out of you on a bike.

867
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,900
Fair enough?

868
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,740
You got my attention, Mr. Moore.
That's pretty rare.

869
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,740
If I were you, I'd think seriously about it.

870
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:35,790
Because you'll have a hard time elsewhere,
now that you've captured our attention.

871
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,870
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm having a little fundraiser.

872
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,750
I got to get back to shaking my tin cup.

873
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,090
What's your number?

874
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,510
I'm sorry?

875
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,630
We'd start you at 300, like everybody else.

876
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,140
I mean, as a partner, I only pull in 600.
And the bonuses...

877
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,640
No, no, no.

878
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,270
Your number.

879
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,520
The amount of money you would need
to just walk away from it and live.

880
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,270
See, I find that everybody has a number,
and it's usually an exact number.

881
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,320
So what is yours?

882
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:10,860
More.

883
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:31,880
How did you know it was Bretton James?

884
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,220
Good morning to you, too. Come in.

885
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,800
-Good morning.
-You hungry?

886
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,470
No. I'm okay, thanks.

887
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,190
Brett, as I called him in the old days,
used to run trades through me.

888
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,400
We used to piggyback off
each other's ideas.

889
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,820
Then we had a little discrepancy.
I won't bother you with the details.

890
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,320
Just to tell you that
it cost me 200,000 bucks,

891
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,660
which was a lot of money back then.

892
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:01,910
So when I got hot in the '80s,
and I started giving tastes to my friends,

893
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,040
I didn't invite James in,
and he didn't like that very much.

894
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,670
So?

895
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,970
So it's no big deal.

896
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,340
But when you're in prison,
you got a lot of time to think.

897
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:22,060
In fact, the best memory that I know
is hurt.

898
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,730
I did eight years, pal.
Five years before that in court.

899
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:29,860
Nobody does eight years.
They give murderers five.

900
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,110
I thought it was the kid
with the airline that gave you up.

901
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,570
Blue Star? Stock Watch? What was it?

902
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,160
-Who, Bud Fox?
-Bud Fox.

903
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,330
No, no, no. He got a wire on him.
He got me for insider trading.

904
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,120
But that's 12, 13 months, max.

905
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:49,210
After the first charges, it was one of my
co-conspirators who tipped off the Feds.

906
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,670
And that pious piranha, Bretton James,

907
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,800
he had just enough information to sink me.

908
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,510
You know, of course,
I'm never going to know it for sure.

909
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,310
He offered me a job.

910
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,070
Well, you just rocketed
into the center of the universe, pal.

911
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:13,940
I think my daughter's future is looking
a hell of a lot better.

912
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,240
I never made any money shorting Hydra.

913
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,620
You're kidding me. You didn't trade it?

914
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,740
That would've been insider trading,
Mr. Gekko.

915
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,830
Remember, your daughter and I
are engaged.

916
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:25,830
You wouldn't want to soil her name, right?

917
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,830
Well, you may not have traded,

918
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,050
but you try telling the Feds
you didn't commit a felony.

919
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,670
-What do you mean?
-You know exactly what I mean.

920
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,510
You induced others to trade on information
that you knew to be false.

921
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,440
Hard to prove that.

922
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:53,030
A fisherman always sees
another fisherman from afar.

923
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:59,950
I think you ought to start
calling me Gordon.

924
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,490
Well, I promised you this,

925
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,620
Gordon.

926
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:05,830
Makes us even.

927
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:07,920
There she is.

928
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,630
But keep this between us, though.

929
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,500
How is that lefty website of hers doing?

930
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,010
-Frozen Truth?
-Yeah.

931
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,090
It's doing well, actually.
They get about 50,000 hits a day.

932
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,680
It's building.

933
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,350
She was such a pisser.

934
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,600
Relationships, they're like bubbles.

935
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:30,520
They're fragile. It's like these tulips.

936
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,110
This is the greatest bubble story
of all time.

937
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:37,320
Back in the 1600s, the Dutch,
they get speculation fever

938
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,950
to the point that you could buy a
beautiful house on a canal in Amsterdam,

939
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:45,040
for the price of one bulb.

940
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,210
They called it "Tulip Mania."

941
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,750
Then it collapsed.

942
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,540
You could buy 10 bulbs for $2.

943
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,880
People got wiped out,
but, you know, who remembers?

944
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,130
What would you do with your money?

945
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,130
Me? Switzerland. Still the best.

946
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:03,470
Got a healthy distrust
for a big government.

947
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,970
Is that where you keep it?

948
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,640
Yes, I did. Now I don't got
that kind of cash anymore.

949
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,400
But you do have money.

950
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,610
This is a rental.

951
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:23,410
I'm pretty sure James has invested
in an offshore fund in the Caymans.

952
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:27,080
Your time, you ever do anything with
some company called Locust Fund?

953
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,830
Locust Fund. I never heard of it,
but it's possible. Yeah.

954
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,330
James wants to build
his alternative energy sector.

955
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,500
Sounds serious.

956
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:37,630
I think I can get him to put real capital
behind this company I told you about.

957
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,420
United Fusion.

958
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,930
James would probably want to polish
his resume a little green.

959
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,350
He's in pole position to be top dog
when Julie Steinhardt kicks the bucket,

960
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,470
which, I hear, could be any day now.

961
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,690
This company could change not just the
energy market, Gordon, but the world.

962
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,690
Idealism. Idealism, pal, it kills every deal.

963
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,360
The thing you got to know about James is,
he's a gambler. You know, like me.

964
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,570
He's got an ego the size of Antarctica.
Like me.

965
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,410
So now you got his attention.

966
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,200
How are you going to shine
sitting on his sun?

967
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:12,620
Make him money and melt his ass.

968
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:18,130
Just like the old days.
We slaughtered men for payback.

969
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,630
Maybe it's time for us
to do our second trade?

970
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:28,350
All right. I'll dig around on James
and this Locust Fund,

971
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,060
and you see what you can do about

972
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,020
getting Winnie and me
back together again.

973
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,650
Well, I never guaranteed
she'd forgive you, Gordon.

974
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:39,190
Why don't we just start with her
agreeing to have dinner with you first?

975
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,110
Well, at my age, I'll take anything I can get.

976
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:48,030
I had two beautiful children.

977
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,210
And then I went away,
and I didn't see them much.

978
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,330
My ex made sure of that.

979
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,380
And then when we lost Rudy,

980
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,970
Winnie just shut down on me.

981
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,440
Except for the exceedingly precious

982
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,940
and depreciating asset of time.

983
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,780
Winnie's all I got left.
You understand that?

984
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,160
I'll try, Gordon.

985
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,200
Well, try harder.
Then you both can have a father.

986
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,630
-He chose this place?
-Yeah.

987
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,640
Yeah, we used to come here
every Sunday night.

988
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,350
You're going to be fine.

989
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:53,720
You do know I'm never
having sex with you again.

990
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,350
Then what my friends say about marriage
is actually true. Five back.

991
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,730
I'm only doing this for you.

992
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,980
No, baby. You're doing this for you.
Come on.

993
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,780
Taxi!

994
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,710
Hi.

995
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,920
Hey.

996
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:24,710
Mr. Gekko.

997
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,260
Jacob Moore. We spoke on the phone.

998
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,590
Yeah.

999
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,310
Okay.

1000
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:41,980
Drinks?

1001
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:44,650
No.

1002
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,610
What about you? Heineken?

1003
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,900
Yeah, sure.

1004
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:00,460
Let me guess. The ginger-garlic lobster.

1005
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,300
I used to order that every time.

1006
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,300
I guess so.

1007
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:13,970
I checked out that website.

1008
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,350
Frozen Truth. It's impressive.

1009
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,230
Thanks. We work hard at it.

1010
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,350
Although, there was a bullshit blog

1011
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,940
blaming the current administration
for the entire mess that we're in.

1012
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:27,570
I don't think that's the truth.

1013
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,740
I agree with you.

1014
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,900
You do?

1015
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:31,030
Yeah. Jack Salmon wrote it...

1016
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,200
Graydy.

1017
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,910
Congratulations. Great to see you.
You're doing great work down there.

1018
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,790
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Gordon. Gordon Gekko.

1019
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,370
Nice to see you. Thanks so much.

1020
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,770
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1021
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,330
Winnie!

1022
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,540
Why did you make me do that, Jake?

1023
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,290
You don't understand.
This is none of your business.

1024
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,960
It is my business. Stop for a second.
Look at the real man in there.

1025
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:27,960
He's hurting.
He's desperate to get you back in his life.

1026
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,960
He's not who you think he is, Jake!

1027
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,800
People change.
It was a long time ago. Winnie.

1028
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,560
He'll hurt us.

1029
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,980
Don't go back in there.

1030
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,400
Are we really going to lead
with this Babaco Solar?

1031
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:56,030
It's a hustle, Bretton. I passed on it
twice within the last two years.

1032
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,580
They spin a sexy story

1033
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,660
with these super-thin
cadmium telluride semiconductors,

1034
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,450
but the truth is,
the technology is not proprietary...

1035
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,000
We've been over this, Bretton.
You are unbelievable, Moore.

1036
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,790
Babaco is a cow. It's dead in the water.

1037
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,630
The Chinese aren't stupid.
They're not going to go for it.

1038
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,750
Yeah, a cash cow maybe.

1039
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,920
They've been saying fusion
is five years away for the last 40 years.

1040
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,170
It is. Laser fusion is the future.

1041
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,510
Can you prove that, boy genius?

1042
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:16,010
Can you prove evolution, girl genius?
That seems to work, though, right?

1043
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,680
Look, knock it off. Both of you.

1044
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,850
These guys are parking 15 billion
across the board in energy sectors

1045
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,980
and I want them here, okay?

1046
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,480
Carol's taking the lead on this.
Our recommend is Babaco. That's final.

1047
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,690
Go ahead.
I'll take you to dinner some other time.

1048
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,320
Eat me, Moore.

1049
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,780
Babaco is at the forefront
of developing thin film technology

1050
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:41,200
to incorporate solar cells
into pliable plastic sheets.

1051
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:44,750
We believe that within the next few years
we can approach the 20% level

1052
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:48,380
making it a perfect match for the
explosion of growth and energy needs,

1053
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,840
which, as you know, is growing at 40%.

1054
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,380
Thin film technology
is the breakthrough here.

1055
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:57,180
And in 2010,

1056
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,550
thin film is going to surpass
crystalline silicon.

1057
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,310
And that's about it.

1058
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,980
-Go ahead.
-So, with the world energy demand

1059
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,770
growing 40% in the next 20 years,

1060
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,820
we at Church believe, Mr. Xu,

1061
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,240
that Babaco Solar
is a cutting-edge no-brainer.

1062
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,320
Good for a 20% return
in the next two years

1063
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,540
with a 30 to 40% upside
in the next five years.

1064
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,290
Thank you, Miss Carol.

1065
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:30,130
Solar will make an important part
of our portfolio.

1066
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:35,420
But truthfully, we have seen
similar technology from another firm.

1067
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,720
As you know, China's demand

1068
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,720
will more than double
before my daughter turns 21.

1069
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:47,430
So we are looking for the next 100 years.

1070
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,150
Where even my grandson
can spend money.

1071
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,690
Do you have anything else
to present to us today?

1072
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,730
We've come a long way.

1073
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,160
Listen, Wang,

1074
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:04,330
now, we got a great new line
on this shale oil technology.

1075
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,750
Let's just dig a lot deeper for a price
that we think is a good one.

1076
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,580
We'll have a complete workup for you
by the end of the month.

1077
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,670
All right, Bretton. That sounds promising.

1078
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,170
What about fusion?

1079
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,550
We happen to be working
with a company right now.

1080
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:22,010
It's got all the hardware in place.
Started by the Department of Energy.

1081
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,560
They share R&D facilities
with the University of California.

1082
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:28,350
It's got a market cap right now
of about a billion. No earnings.

1083
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,270
Fusion has been around a long time.

1084
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,730
"Good things take time."

1085
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,070
<i>The simple of it is,</i>

1086
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,450
<i>it's using the intense energy</i>
<i>of some 200 laser beams</i>

1087
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,320
<i>focused on a single target</i>
<i>the size of a few grains of rice</i>

1088
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:45,030
filled with hydrogen fuel.

1089
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,450
So the idea being that
when that target combusts

1090
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,960
<i>it produces more energy than it took in.</i>

1091
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,920
All the tests they've done indicate
that they can use this ignition process

1092
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,750
to turn simple seawater into energy.

1093
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,260
<i>lt's called</i>
<i>Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion</i>

1094
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,470
<i>using the reaction between hot water</i>
<i>on the surface</i>

1095
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:05,010
<i>and cold water beneath</i>
<i>to power the lasers.</i>

1096
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,890
So what you wind up with
is unlimited clean energy.

1097
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,560
How do you contain the explosion?

1098
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,390
That's a secret
I can't really share with you right now.

1099
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,230
Not to be secretive, but I could
probably get you in there for a peek.

1100
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,780
Maybe next week,
on your way back to Beijing from DC?

1101
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,150
Mr. Wang, I got you something.

1102
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,320
This is American baijiu.

1103
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,910
"Johnnie Walker Blue Label."

1104
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,040
Thank you.

1105
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,660
-Miss Chung, this is for you.
-Thank you.

1106
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,510
I used to go with Zabel to China.

1107
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:45,050
Their culture's as much about manners
as it is about business.

1108
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,350
They're on the hook, Jake.
That's all I care about.

1109
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,560
Good.

1110
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:50,850
I'll send him some bamboo flowers

1111
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,690
symbolizing continued growth
and prosperity.

1112
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:57,730
You don't always listen so good, Jake,
but you got fight in you.

1113
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,190
I like that.

1114
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,290
I think you might just have something
on James.

1115
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:19,840
My friend in Switzerland, he confirmed
that this Locust Fund, it exists and it's big.

1116
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,960
A billion dollars.

1117
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,050
It just might be our friend Bretton

1118
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,390
was trading through his own account,
outside of Churchill Schwartz.

1119
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,970
Can we get that on the record?

1120
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,890
That's the hard part, isn't it?

1121
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:40,110
So what are we going to do
about my daughter, Jake?

1122
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:43,820
I told you, I'm sorry about the other night.
Gordon, I can't control her, you know?

1123
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:45,070
Yeah.

1124
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:50,950
You know, they say parents are the bones
on which children sharpen their teeth.

1125
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,870
Find another way for me to get with her.
You know, there's got to be...

1126
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,170
That dinner that's coming up,
all the Street guys are going?

1127
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:00,790
-The Alzheimer's thing at the Met.
-Yeah. I'm taking her.

1128
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,670
I wish I had 10K for a seat.

1129
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,380
A writer's got to sell
a lot of books for that.

1130
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,350
And we both know how Winnie
would react to the fact

1131
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:13,680
that you've been bonding
with your future father-in-law.

1132
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:15,390
Is that a threat?

1133
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,940
Absolutely.

1134
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:22,230
Well, consider it done.

1135
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,030
I just got to put you at another table.
It's got to look like an accident.

1136
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,320
I like trading with you, Jake.

1137
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,870
See you around campus.

1138
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,660
Hey.

1139
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,080
Get her a ring, for Christ's sake!

1140
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,520
How are you, Bill?

1141
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:01,150
Julie, how nice to see you.

1142
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:03,570
Well, it's a pleasure to see you, William.

1143
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:05,440
So nice to see you.

1144
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:09,150
Have you spoken to J.P.
about the conservancy?

1145
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,870
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Hi.

1146
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,880
Congratulations.
Looks like you won this one.

1147
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,210
-Hi.
-It's not over yet.

1148
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,720
-Have you met Jake?
-Good to see you. How's your husband?

1149
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,840
Very well.

1150
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,220
I gotta tell you, Mr. Gekko,

1151
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:35,930
seeing you speak was inspirational
on so many levels.

1152
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,560
Because, I'll tell you, I'm on the outside.

1153
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,100
I'm looking at all my buddies
making all this money

1154
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,480
and I'm thinking, "Fellas,

1155
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,320
"there's no there, there." You know?

1156
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,570
But listen, I'm at your table.
We can talk about this all night.

1157
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:49,240
That's great, Robby.
I'll see you later then, all right?

1158
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,700
Hey, Gordon.

1159
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:53,700
Looking good.

1160
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:54,990
My God.

1161
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:59,370
Bud Fox, huh? I haven't seen you in years.

1162
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,540
This is Erin and Christina.

1163
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:03,290
-Hi.
-Hello. Hi.

1164
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,710
What was that airline called?
Blue Star, that's right.

1165
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,380
That must be keeping you
pretty busy now, huh?

1166
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:12,840
Excuse me.

1167
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:18,390
Well, after a little time away,
I actually turned it into

1168
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:23,270
one of the largest private jet brokerages
in the world and sold it. Made millions.

1169
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,480
That's great, pal. That's really great.
So what's up next?

1170
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,780
You're looking at it. Golf,

1171
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,780
winters in St. Barts, philanthropy.

1172
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,330
And how about you, Gordon?

1173
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:40,500
Does Blue Horseshoe
still love Anacott Steel?

1174
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:42,790
You know it.

1175
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,090
Well, I'll see you around
sometime, Gordon.

1176
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,010
Stay out of trouble.

1177
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,560
And the website's called Frozen Truth.

1178
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:47,940
-Frozen Truth?
-Yeah.

1179
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,110
That's catchy. I like that.

1180
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:53,110
What we really need
is some game-changing news.

1181
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,780
And now you can come out of nowhere
with one big story.

1182
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:59,120
Since "Mission Accomplished"
broke the Senator's affair,

1183
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,290
they've gotten 200,000 hits a day.

1184
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,290
Is it expensive to run?

1185
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,960
Not really. It's a shoestring budget.

1186
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,460
Maybe Jake can find ways
to raise you some money

1187
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,960
flip it to the public?

1188
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,460
We don't really want to go public.
It would affect our credibility.

1189
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,970
We want to stay non-profit.

1190
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,340
Non-profit? What is that?
I don't know what that is.

1191
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:20,100
-I've heard the term before, "non-profit."
-That's very funny.

1192
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:22,810
You know what it is?
Isn't that when you came out of school

1193
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,180
and you had to do something for
the government, like it was mandatory?

1194
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:27,650
-Very funny.
-It was called the draft.

1195
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,980
-It was called the draft.
-It's called the draft.

1196
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,860
So one day, Brett, Churchill Schwartz

1197
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,820
is going to buy every table
at this jackal's ball.

1198
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:36,650
They're going to call it
"a religious revival."

1199
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,910
Winn, you don't have to leave
on my behalf.

1200
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:42,540
I'm only going to be here
a couple of seconds.

1201
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,410
No. Stay. I'm just going to get some air.

1202
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:01,260
If somebody took this place out tonight,
there'd be nobody left to rule the world.

1203
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,430
But, Brett, congratulations.
I know how hard you worked for all of this.

1204
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,100
I go by "Bretton" these days.

1205
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:14,110
It's a beneficiary of a few bull markets.
That's all it takes.

1206
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,490
So easy, even a caveman can do it, right?

1207
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:17,780
That's right.

1208
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,200
You make modesty a virtue, Bretton.

1209
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:25,790
The truth is, nobody needs
inside information anymore to get rich.

1210
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:30,290
All you have to do is stay out of jail.

1211
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,630
-Glad to be here, Bretton.
-Herb.

1212
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:37,010
Actually, jail was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1213
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:39,170
-Oh, yeah?
-Got me to think.

1214
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,470
It centers a man.

1215
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:45,140
I probably should thank
whoever put me in there.

1216
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:50,980
You know, I saw you on television
the other night.

1217
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,900
You are quite the bear.

1218
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:55,900
You be careful, you know.

1219
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:58,690
Your daughter's financial health
is now in our hands.

1220
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,160
-So it is, so it is.
-Yeah, it is.

1221
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,240
But your firm knows sub-primes are crap.

1222
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:08,660
The way you keep buying
Bernie's insurance swaps lately,

1223
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:12,750
I mean, I gotta worry about
my grandchildren's college education.

1224
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,340
-We like insurance.
-What's not to like?

1225
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,010
Easy selling crack to kids
in a school playground.

1226
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,050
Credit default swap is a good idea.
It's the execution that isn't.

1227
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:26,060
Well, you know what they say.

1228
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:30,520
Bulls make money, bears make money,
and the pigs, they get slaughtered.

1229
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,310
I thought this was a charity event, Gordon.

1230
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,810
Why don't you go find some?

1231
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,780
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal, Bretton.

1232
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:44,700
You stop telling lies about me,
I'll stop telling the truth about you.

1233
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:55,920
That's sad.

1234
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,960
-Isn't it?
-It's pathetic.

1235
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,300
That he can't just take his ball
and go home.

1236
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,800
He has to piss on the whole game.

1237
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:09,720
-I'm going to go find Winnie.
-Oh, look, by the way,

1238
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,390
I talked to Wang today.

1239
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,820
I think the Chinese are close. Very close.

1240
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:21,150
In any case, I want to talk to you
about the future,

1241
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,240
about how we're going
to bring this over the top.

1242
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,570
-Sure.
-Okay?

1243
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,410
-Tomorrow?
-Possibly tomorrow.

1244
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,830
-Okay. Okay.
-All right.

1245
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,330
Hi.

1246
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:46,470
He's a good kid.

1247
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,930
He came from nothing.

1248
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:51,140
Hustler, like me.

1249
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:57,440
You think he's the one for you, Winn?

1250
01:16:58,150 --> 01:16:59,150
Yep.

1251
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,360
Well, just make sure he's worthy of you

1252
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:07,110
because, whether you like it or not,
you're still a Gekko.

1253
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,870
And whether you like it or not

1254
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:14,660
that name
doesn't mean anything anymore.

1255
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,380
Why do you say something like that?

1256
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:23,050
We had an agreement.

1257
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:26,430
You remember?
Last time you came down to see me?

1258
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,640
We were going to take a little trip.

1259
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,930
When I got out, you remember that?
To Switzerland?

1260
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,640
Yeah.

1261
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:35,520
That was before Rudy.

1262
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:43,610
Some of the things that came out
after you went away,

1263
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:48,450
things you were recorded saying,
the affairs?

1264
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:52,580
That wasn't you. That wasn't my father.
It was some sociopath.

1265
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,250
-It was nine years ago.
-So?

1266
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,910
When are you going to stop?

1267
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,090
You got no idea
what hell I went through in there.

1268
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:07,720
Hell, for you? It was hell for you?

1269
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,720
Do you know what you did to Rudy?
To all of us? You drove Mom mad.

1270
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:12,850
Winnie,

1271
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,390
he was my only son.

1272
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:21,150
I tried everything.
I put him in the 12-step deal.

1273
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:24,150
I never told you,
I borrowed money from hardcore guys.

1274
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,070
Tens of thousands of dollars,
which I didn't have.

1275
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:30,910
I gave it to the best therapist I could find.

1276
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:35,950
I even tried to pay off one scumbag dealer
not to sell any more to my boy!

1277
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:40,080
But if you'd been there, Dad...

1278
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:45,300
If you hadn't been in prison,

1279
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,670
it would've been different.

1280
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:52,260
Winnie, you got no idea

1281
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:55,140
how much I beat myself up,

1282
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,810
how many mistakes I made as a father.

1283
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,480
Rudy...

1284
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:03,520
He was a victim, you know.
Like, he had cancer.

1285
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,360
You cannot blame me.

1286
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,400
And you gotta stop blaming yourself.

1287
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:22,460
You're all I got left, honey.

1288
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,790
Nothing else

1289
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:28,300
matters.

1290
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,390
I cannot make it right again,
but I can make things better.

1291
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,230
I'm your dad.

1292
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:44,020
And whatever you say
till the day that I die,

1293
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,980
you're my gal.

1294
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,530
You're the only one.

1295
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:53,070
You're my baby.

1296
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,580
Please.

1297
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:04,250
Winnie, just try to forgive me.

1298
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,430
Dad.

1299
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,200
It's done, Doc.

1300
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,620
Look, you're an older guy, so
I don't want you to have a heart attack.

1301
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,880
But Bretton James just said
we're gonna get $100 million!

1302
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,040
<i>-Are you serious, my boy?</i>
-Yes!

1303
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:49,960
Bretton says the Chinese are close!

1304
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:52,460
But look, you get some sleep, all right?
You deserve it.

1305
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:55,340
<i>-Thank you, Jacob.</i>
-I'll talk to you soon.

1306
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:35,930
<i>There is carnage on Wall Street.</i>

1307
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,430
<i>The shares of the major</i>
<i>financial stocks plummeting.</i>

1308
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:41,720
<i>lt's triggering a major sell-off</i>
<i>in the markets.</i>

1309
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:43,520
<i>The damage, widespread.</i>

1310
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,640
<i>The NASDAQ's plunging.</i>

1311
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,480
<i>The Dow Jones Industrial Average</i>
<i>is plunging, and oil is plunging.</i>

1312
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,690
<i>Literally a 180 points</i>
<i>just added to the decline.</i>

1313
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,570
<i>You can hear the hollering on the floor.</i>

1314
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,610
<i>We're down 260, literally in a split second.</i>

1315
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,490
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>the Dow Jones Industrial Average</i>

1316
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:59,280
<i>is now 500 points on the decline.</i>

1317
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:01,620
<i>The headline of the</i>
<i>new housing report is grim</i>

1318
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:05,450
<i>that this is shaping up to be the worst</i>
<i>real estate market in a generation.</i>

1319
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,500
<i>We are now at the highest point there, 724.</i>

1320
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,580
<i>That was the biggest loss</i>
<i>we've seen today.</i>

1321
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:11,540
<i>We're now in historic territory.</i>

1322
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:14,000
<i>Investors are getting</i>
<i>their heads handed to them</i>

1323
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,130
<i>as another US banking institution</i>
<i>nears collapse.</i>

1324
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:20,050
<i>The President's Working Group</i>
<i>is going into emergency meetings</i>

1325
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:23,220
<i>with the Secretary of the Treasury</i>
<i>and the Federal Reserve Board.</i>

1326
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:35,070
The President's Chief of Staff
is calling back in an hour.

1327
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,490
He's with the President.

1328
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:40,160
And he's going to want to know
what I think we should do.

1329
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,330
This isn't Keller Zabel, Bill.

1330
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,500
This is too big to fail.

1331
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:50,790
-This is just an insane situation.
-This is now.

1332
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,920
There's about 70-plus trillion out there
in credit default swaps

1333
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,380
held by roughly 17 banks.

1334
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,670
And we do not know where the bottom is.

1335
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,470
How much are you guys thinking?

1336
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,550
At least five.

1337
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,680
I think six.

1338
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:09,020
Bill, I frankly think
Harry and Charlie are low.

1339
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:11,270
I think we're talking seven, eight.

1340
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,980
Hundred billion?

1341
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,860
Selling this to Congress is the problem.

1342
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:23,820
They're going to want to know
where the money's going.

1343
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:26,160
They'll jawbone this to death.

1344
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:30,790
-Scare them.
-How?

1345
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,420
Tell them the truth.

1346
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,960
The government's got to
restore confidence.

1347
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:39,920
If we don't stop the bleeding,
in three days,

1348
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:42,640
half the banks in this room
are out of business.

1349
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,100
And in five days, we're all gone.

1350
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:49,560
You men realize what you've done here?

1351
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:56,360
You are asking for the biggest bailout
in the history of this country.

1352
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,110
You're talking nationalization, Bretton.

1353
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,280
Socialism.

1354
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:08,620
I have fought it all my life.

1355
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:12,210
And if we don't get it, Bill,

1356
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,500
there won't be any history.

1357
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,380
Music stops.

1358
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,260
Ball's over.

1359
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,430
Julie?

1360
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,600
1929.

1361
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,640
It'll get worse now, because It'll go faster.

1362
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:38,110
Money markets will dry up
around the world by the end of the week.

1363
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:41,150
ATMs will stop spitting bills.

1364
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,450
Federal Deposit Insurance will collapse.

1365
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:48,330
Banks will close.

1366
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,120
Mobs, panic.

1367
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:56,830
It's going to be the end of the world, Bill.

1368
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,340
See?

1369
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,890
All right, boys.

1370
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,180
You'll hear from us tonight.

1371
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,650
<i>What is going to happen here?</i>
<i>Does government have to get involved?</i>

1372
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:22,610
<i>Are we potentially at a point</i>
<i>where we might actually lose</i>

1373
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,610
<i>the financial system as we know it?</i>

1374
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,660
<i>If the government doesn't get involved,</i>

1375
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:30,030
<i>there is a risk of a global meltdown</i>
<i>of the global financial system.</i>

1376
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,410
<i>This is a financial crisis,</i>

1377
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:34,460
<i>and anyone who doesn't admit that</i>
<i>is just kidding themselves.</i>

1378
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:35,960
<i>-We've seen something like this.</i>
<i>-Polly, l disagree.</i>

1379
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,790
<i>You've gotta get the government to say no</i>
<i>in a situation like this.</i>

1380
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,630
<i>True capitalism</i>
<i>is about disaster and correction.</i>

1381
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,960
<i>lt's a natural cycle.</i>

1382
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:44,510
<i>Without it, you create all kinds</i>

1383
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:46,930
<i>-of artificial anomalies in the market.</i>
<i>-But if we don't fix this now,</i>

1384
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,510
<i>you're going to have...</i>

1385
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,720
<i>This is something this country</i>
<i>hasn't experienced before.</i>

1386
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:53,060
<i>lt's an economic Pearl Harbor.</i>

1387
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,390
<i>We got to figure out some way</i>
<i>to put the fire out.</i>

1388
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,600
<i>And that means government...</i>

1389
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:05,070
Your father predicted this.

1390
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,490
When I was little,

1391
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,200
I'd hear my dad in the kitchen late at night.

1392
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:15,960
His case was on appeal.

1393
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:21,710
I'd go and sit with him. We'd eat ice cream.

1394
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,550
I never knew him as a peaceful person.

1395
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:29,680
It always scared me.

1396
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,260
This is scary.

1397
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:35,390
What's going to happen?

1398
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,270
It'll be the end.

1399
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:45,280
Well, that's unacceptable.

1400
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:47,900
Why?

1401
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,610
Because I'm pregnant, Jake.

1402
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:03,130
-You're pregnant?
-Yeah.

1403
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,180
That's fantastic.

1404
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:41,250
<i>And we are talking on the S&P 500</i>

1405
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:44,040
<i>a loss of almost eight percent in one day,</i>

1406
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:46,670
<i>surpassing September 1 7th, 2001.</i>

1407
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,090
<i>That's the day markets opened</i>
<i>after the attacks of 9/ 1 1.</i>

1408
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,630
<i>...last night on Wall Street</i>

1409
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,640
<i>and swept through</i>
<i>Japan, China, India and Europe</i>

1410
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:58,890
<i>after one of the worst days</i>
<i>on global stock markets in modern times.</i>

1411
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,400
They said your office.

1412
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:50,570
It's too depressing today.
This is my other office.

1413
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,320
This might be dangerous.
Think you can keep up?

1414
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:56,570
World's crashing anyway. We'll see, right?

1415
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:21,580
That's not bad, Jake.

1416
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:24,660
Though I think they might have given you
the faster bike.

1417
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:26,870
I'm sure that's what it was.

1418
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:29,630
You know,

1419
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:32,040
I've always believed
that a man should have,

1420
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:36,590
at one time or another in his life,
both a mentor and a protégé.

1421
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:38,090
Who's yours?

1422
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:40,220
The man who brought me
into Churchill Schwartz.

1423
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:44,720
Bill Clark at Treasury. He's been
a good friend to us during this crisis.

1424
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:47,940
You got the makings of a leader, Jake.

1425
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:51,400
I just want you to know,
there's no hard feelings on this.

1426
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:53,860
No one's going to lose.

1427
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:56,280
With Clark in, I think we're in good shape.

1428
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,110
You got a great future.

1429
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,950
I don't understand.

1430
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:02,490
Didn't you read this morning's
capital breakdown?

1431
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:05,870
No, I came right up to the roof.
Why? What happened?

1432
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:13,380
Look, the Chinese money,
it's going to Babaco Solar.

1433
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,380
-What?
-We took another look

1434
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:20,180
and we just don't think United Fusion
is ever gonna achieve what they claim.

1435
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,640
Babaco needs this money to build
these three fabrications...

1436
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,970
You might as well
just burn the money, Bretton.

1437
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,430
You told me, I told Dr. Masters.
He's expecting it.

1438
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,560
The decision's been made.

1439
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,690
Unless you want it to die.

1440
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:36,320
Of course. Seawater is in a lot more supply
than crude. Right, Bretton?

1441
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,610
-You an idealist or a capitalist, Jacob?
-I'm a realist.

1442
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:42,490
You're a real piece of work, Bretton.

1443
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:44,740
You're giving the money to Babaco
because it's a hustle.

1444
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:47,700
It's all inside. That's why
your oil companies are safe, right?

1445
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:52,790
The mentor-protégé relationship
is not emotional over anything.

1446
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:56,380
I thought you might be a good addition
to the Churchill Schwartz team.

1447
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,090
-Am I mistaken?
-Let me tell you something, Bretton.

1448
01:31:58,210 --> 01:32:01,470
You are not my mentor. Lou Zabel was.
And whether you admit it or not,

1449
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,640
your raid destroyed Zabel
and forced him to suicide.

1450
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:08,350
So you may talk about moral hazard.
You are the moral hazard.

1451
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:12,770
You are the worst kind of toxic debt
this system's polluted with.

1452
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:16,860
-Is this a threat?
-Absolutely.

1453
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:27,080
This is so disappointing.

1454
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:30,450
I really saw so much in you, Jacob.

1455
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:36,880
You should look in the mirror first.
See yourself. It might scare you, Bretton.

1456
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:43,630
Consider the motorcycle
part of your severance.

1457
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,390
Fuck you, Bretton!

1458
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,560
-Here you are.
-Thanks a lot.

1459
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:55,850
-Hi. For Elise.
-"For Elise."

1460
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:58,820
-And can I ask you a question, Mr. Gekko?
-Certainly, Elise.

1461
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,240
What exactly is "moral hazard"?

1462
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,490
-He screwed me.
-Excuse me?

1463
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,740
Shocker.

1464
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:09,030
He saw that fusion was actually possible,
so he killed it.

1465
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,200
Well, that's a little far-fetched.

1466
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,710
But then, these days, anything is possible.

1467
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:15,580
Well, I quit, Gordon.

1468
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:20,210
That's really going to help.
I'll see you outside in 15 minutes.

1469
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:23,420
Moral hazard, that's when somebody

1470
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:26,550
takes your money
and is not responsible for it.

1471
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:31,470
This guy James,
he must walk between raindrops.

1472
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,180
He's a monkey dancing on a razorblade.

1473
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:39,730
Not only did he start the rumors at Zabel
to get your bank for peanuts,

1474
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:42,480
the guy was trading for his own account
in this Locust Fund.

1475
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:43,900
-He was?
-He was.

1476
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:47,870
And he was betting against the market
that he was making.

1477
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:51,790
But the kicker is, so was his firm.

1478
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:54,290
Churchill Schwartz
was shorting sub-primes?

1479
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:57,290
Yeah, for the last two years
they've been hedging.

1480
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:01,130
Not just sub-primes.
Primes, indexes, the whole thing.

1481
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,970
But they knew this home loan fantasy
was going to collapse the market.

1482
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:10,010
And when they did, they got the Feds

1483
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:15,060
to bail out their bad insurance swaps,
a 100 cents on the dollar.

1484
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:18,770
I mean, talk about an evil empire.
This puts me to shame.

1485
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,940
And I'm small-time
compared to these crooks.

1486
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:27,030
The system is insolvent
if no one knows what to do next

1487
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:30,570
except repeat the insanity
till the next bubble blows.

1488
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,990
That'll be the one. The big one.

1489
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:38,040
The tipping point, just like the tulip.

1490
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:41,960
We could still go after James on this.
Just bring it all out.

1491
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:43,800
Easy, Trigger.

1492
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,380
Media is not going to get in the way
of Churchill or the government.

1493
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:50,220
They want their profits
just like the rest of us.

1494
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:52,390
It's unethical, but it's not illegal.

1495
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:55,980
When everyone's running for the lifeboats,
who's going to care?

1496
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,600
Maybe some little leftist website?

1497
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:00,400
Your daughter will run it.
It'll get some play.

1498
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:10,070
Look, Bretton is not an enemy
a kid like you wants to have for life.

1499
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,320
Just get out of this racket.

1500
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:15,120
Settle down with Winnie.
Live a happy life somewhere.

1501
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,250
-What?
-Well, you know, she's got enough money.

1502
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:20,370
-What do you mean?
-You're smart.

1503
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,000
You'll come up with another way
to slice bread.

1504
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:24,670
-What money?
-My money.

1505
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:28,630
Stop playing it dumb, will you, Jake?
I know you know.

1506
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,050
Know what?

1507
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:33,180
Are you telling me
that you're not the only one

1508
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,890
in this relationship keeping a secret?

1509
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,730
Hold on a second. What money, Gordon?

1510
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,940
-Switzerland.
-How much?

1511
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,740
It's close to $100 million by now.

1512
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,530
What do you say we split a cab?

1513
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:06,130
I set it up as a Swiss account in the '80s
before all the trouble.

1514
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:07,250
Hey, chief.

1515
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,920
Look, I'll pay you extra. Just slow down.

1516
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:11,260
Can you... Can you...

1517
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:15,640
When she was 18, I told her she would
come into it all when she turned 25.

1518
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:19,640
And she agreed to stake me
when I got out.

1519
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:24,060
Then Rudy died, and she reneged.

1520
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,730
She never visited me again.

1521
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:28,650
She told me she had a small trust

1522
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,490
from you and her mom,
but she didn't care anything about it.

1523
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:32,740
She was going to give it to charity
when she was 25.

1524
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:35,120
Well, it's easy for her to say.
She never earned it.

1525
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:39,660
And now you want it
for your fusion delusion.

1526
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:43,330
But it's a trust. I mean, she couldn't
break into it before she was 25 anyway.

1527
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:46,500
Are you as dumb as you sound?
Anything can be revoked.

1528
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:50,800
They don't got trusts in Switzerland.
It's an account, that's all.

1529
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,090
I know the bank well.
They'll work with me.

1530
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,560
But you still need her signature, of course.

1531
01:36:58,890 --> 01:37:03,270
When it comes to money, sport,
your eyes suddenly shine, just like mine.

1532
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:08,150
Great! Saved another life?

1533
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:10,190
Asshole!

1534
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,240
Are you crazy? You want to die?

1535
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:18,160
How do we do this?

1536
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:24,500
She goes with you to Switzerland,
she signs the account over to your control

1537
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:27,460
then you give me the money
and I'll get it to the States for you.

1538
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,800
You mean launder it?

1539
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,550
Look, pal, you want the IRS on Winnie?

1540
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:36,720
Because you damn well know
she is complicit and seriously liable.

1541
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,300
All right? You want the money?

1542
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:57,700
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi.

1543
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:01,620
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah. I'll be back in a sec.

1544
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:07,000
Why didn't you tell me
about the $100 million?

1545
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:14,920
How did you find...
How did you find out in the first place?

1546
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:16,630
Did you talk to my father?

1547
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,930
I found out because Churchill Schwartz's
international trading desk

1548
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:20,680
handles some of the money,
and your name came up,

1549
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,890
along with Gordon Gekko.

1550
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:26,100
I never considered it mine.
I was 14. I was a minor when he set it up.

1551
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:27,310
Yeah, but you didn't do anything
with the money

1552
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,440
when you turned into a major, did you?

1553
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,440
-I was going to give it to charity.
-Really?

1554
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,070
What were you gonna do,
launder the money yourself, Winnie?

1555
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:36,450
-What was your plan?
-I didn't think about it.

1556
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:38,450
-You didn't think about it?
-It was my father's money.

1557
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:40,370
-You know how he got it.
-No, you're wrong. It's your money.

1558
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:43,120
It's $100 million of your money.

1559
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,700
Do you know what that means?

1560
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:49,080
That's five years in jail. You're gonna
get busted with him for tax fraud.

1561
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:51,130
This is serious, Winnie.

1562
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:01,390
You could do something good
with this money.

1563
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,350
This is more than just charity, Winn.

1564
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:09,650
You might want to wipe some of the drool
off your face, Jake.

1565
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:12,310
Winnie, if it wasn't important,
I'd totally understand, but it is.

1566
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:14,320
You know that fusion just might work.

1567
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,490
I know it sounds like <i>Star Wars,</i> love,

1568
01:39:16,610 --> 01:39:19,110
but if it weren't for crazy people
who thought these crazy things

1569
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:22,200
then where would we be
in this world? Nowhere.

1570
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:27,500
Winnie, Dr. Masters is a genius.
He's a pioneer.

1571
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:29,370
They might just solve this thing.
It could change the world.

1572
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,670
Yeah, okay. Is this about changing
the world or making money?

1573
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:33,340
Because you come into my office,
pitching to me.

1574
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:34,710
You sound like a Wall Street guy.

1575
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,800
Hold on for a second!
I am a Wall Street guy.

1576
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,050
I am and I'm good at this.

1577
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:42,050
And I believe in this.
And you know that I do.

1578
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:44,430
What do you wanna do, just report
the news for the rest of your life

1579
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,220
or do you want to make the news?
This is your opportunity.

1580
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,600
It's your chance to shine.

1581
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:50,560
To be Captain America.

1582
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,070
This is the most charitable
you could ever be in your life!

1583
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:07,950
You honestly believe in this?

1584
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:13,040
Let's say I could... Let's say I could get
the money now, hypothetically, right?

1585
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:14,210
Not that you care about the money.

1586
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,540
But let's say I could take out a loan
against it,

1587
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:18,340
minimize your risk as much as possible.

1588
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,720
Would you do this for me, Winn?

1589
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,100
Would you do this for me?

1590
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:55,040
Very well, Miss Gekko.
We will have your father co-sign

1591
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,250
and we will see to it
that the funds are transferred.

1592
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:59,210
-Thank you.
<i>-Danke schön,</i> Miss Gekko.

1593
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:00,880
-Mr. Moore.
-Yes?

1594
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:04,590
Mr. Gekko asked that you call him in
New York as soon as this meeting is over.

1595
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,010
Thank you.

1596
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,930
So I'll take care of the rest of this.
You go back to the hotel.

1597
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:11,230
-All right.
-I just got the confirmation.

1598
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:12,770
We're on the direct flight to New York
in the morning.

1599
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:14,020
Great.

1600
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:16,360
-Great news on the loft.
-Yeah?

1601
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,400
Yeah, I got a buyer.
So one less thing in our lives, right?

1602
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:21,940
-I kind of like the feeling.
-Yeah, so do I.

1603
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:24,360
-I'll see you over there.
-Okay.

1604
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:36,380
Hey, anyone can figure out life
when you're looking back on it.

1605
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:39,880
But we got to live it going forward.
Right, Jakie?

1606
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:44,630
Besides, four-and-a-half is great
in this market.

1607
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:47,550
Yeah, except I owe six to the bank.
When do I have to be out of here?

1608
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,810
You got three months more.

1609
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:53,480
By the way, I had to throw in the furniture.

1610
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:55,850
What there was of it.

1611
01:41:57,230 --> 01:42:00,110
Did you want me
to have a yard sale here for you?

1612
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:02,480
Here. Take it. Here's your pen.

1613
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,580
-Jake...
-Dolores was just leaving.

1614
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:23,960
Hello to you, too, honey.
Don't forget. Three months, honey.

1615
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:32,850
-Bastards changed the locks.
-You weren't servicing the loans, Ma.

1616
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:35,940
Well, they lied to me. They told me
they were going to give me more time.

1617
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:38,230
Well, they're not, okay?
They're panicking. Everyone is panicking.

1618
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:40,940
They're gonna throw it in the market
and take what they can get for it, Ma.

1619
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:43,190
But it's not even finished yet.

1620
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,950
And that's not all. Look.

1621
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:47,780
It's the other properties, Mom.

1622
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:50,200
No, but they said they were gonna give me
a little more time.

1623
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,870
And all I need is a 1 10 grand,

1624
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:55,080
and then that way,
I can keep all three properties in play.

1625
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,910
-I know you have it, Jake.
-I don't have it, Mom.

1626
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,460
-You have it, Jacob.
-I don't have it,

1627
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:00,130
and I wouldn't give it to you if I did have it.

1628
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,300
-What am I supposed to do?
-You know what moral hazard is, Ma?

1629
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:04,510
-You know what that means?
-No.

1630
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:06,170
It means that once you get bailed out,
what's to stop you

1631
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:08,630
-from taking another shot?
-But I...

1632
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,760
I'm in trouble, Mom.
I am in trouble right now.

1633
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:13,260
I'm taking a huge hit on the loft,
I just sold my bike for nothing

1634
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:15,390
and now, again,
I'm writing you a check, Mom.

1635
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,890
It's ridiculous.

1636
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:20,310
This is $30,000 that I barely have.

1637
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:22,570
-But that's not enough, honey.
-Ma, I love you,

1638
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:24,860
but I cannot keep hemorrhaging money
for your insanity.

1639
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:26,610
What you need to do
is you need to go back to Henry.

1640
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:28,110
You need to get another job, okay?

1641
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:31,570
But this is my job. I have a job.
What do you... Oh, my God.

1642
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:34,200
-You mean like a real job with a boss?
-Yes, a real job.

1643
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:35,830
-I'm too old to get a...
-I'm sorry, Ma,

1644
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:37,000
you got to start at some point.

1645
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:40,250
You got to start now.
I can't keep carrying you forever.

1646
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:43,420
You're not the only one
who's in trouble, Ma. Please.

1647
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:46,840
-Hello?
<i>-Hey, Jake. We have a problem.</i>

1648
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:49,470
Go ahead.

1649
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:53,350
I don't know what happened.
My CFO says the money hasn't arrived yet.

1650
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,310
Yeah, but it was sent yesterday.

1651
01:43:57,430 --> 01:44:00,060
It should have been there
before the Fedwire closed at 6:00.

1652
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:04,730
Well, maybe there's been some sort
of mistake. It was a large amount.

1653
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:08,860
Okay, just sit tight.

1654
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,610
<i>-All right?</i>
-Jesus.

1655
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:21,040
A few days? In this city that's nothing.

1656
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:24,460
Mr. Gekko is good tenant.

1657
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,630
I appreciate it.

1658
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,570
<i>A fisherman always sees</i>
<i>another fisherman from afar.</i>

1659
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,040
<i>Winnie's all l got left.</i>
<i>You understand that?</i>

1660
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,540
<i>How much?</i>

1661
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:07,210
Close to $100 million by now.

1662
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,010
Don't go back in there, Jake.

1663
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:17,050
This is who he is.

1664
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:21,560
I did tell you, Jake.

1665
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,560
I did warn you.

1666
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,900
I lied to you, Winnie.

1667
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:37,370
I've been in contact with your father
behind your back.

1668
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:44,000
After we saw him at the dinner,

1669
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:47,080
before you gave me the money.

1670
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,140
Why?

1671
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:06,980
Because I thought it was
the best thing for you, you know. For us.

1672
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:18,160
I just wanted to...

1673
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:27,250
You're like him.

1674
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:31,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Winnie.

1675
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:37,470
I'll make it up to you.
I promise I'll get the money back.

1676
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:41,760
I don't care about the money, Jake!
This is not about the money.

1677
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:44,640
This is about you and me,
and we are not good anymore.

1678
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,980
Winn, we are good. Come on.

1679
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,360
We are good.

1680
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:55,490
-Come on, Winn. We're good.
-No.

1681
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,160
We're supposed
to make each other feel safe.

1682
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,290
Otherwise, what's the point?

1683
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,000
It's gone, Jake.

1684
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:16,170
It's not. Please don't.

1685
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:17,720
Take it.

1686
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,680
Come on, Winn.

1687
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:28,230
Please go.

1688
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:30,730
Please.

1689
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:32,940
Go.

1690
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:41,240
I'm sorry.

1691
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:19,400
China, India, Brazil.
Silver, oil, copper, I want to own it all.

1692
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:22,160
Buy me Churchill Schwartz,

1693
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:24,740
and get me updates
on the other financials.

1694
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:27,620
I'm looking for deals. Only good deals.

1695
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:31,120
Just ride the trends.
Just don't try too hard for the turns.

1696
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:33,330
It's just like the old days, Bobby.

1697
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:35,460
<i>What do you feel</i>
<i>about California municipals, Gordon?</i>

1698
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:38,170
No way.
California has made more mistakes

1699
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:40,930
than Yogi Berra reciting Shakespeare.

1700
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:45,350
Right now, it is ugly times ugly.

1701
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:48,720
And that's when the ugly get going.

1702
01:48:49,810 --> 01:48:53,230
You tell them for me, babe,
Gordon Gekko is back.

1703
01:48:56,110 --> 01:48:59,360
I'm looking for distressed securities.
I'm trying to get a hold of them

1704
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:02,200
before the government does. You got that?

1705
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:04,070
Okay.

1706
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:07,370
-Here you are, Mr. Gekko.
-Nice, Harry.

1707
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:10,790
Well, then, Alex,
you tell the Treasury Department for me

1708
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:14,120
that I'm willing to stand
on the other side of their auction.

1709
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:16,710
Not too tight under the arms, Mr. Gekko?

1710
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,880
Jesus Christ. I tell you,
the government's worse than a wife.

1711
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:23,010
They got all the power,
they got half the money.

1712
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:25,550
Now they're working
on getting the other half.

1713
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:27,640
Hey, hey, stay positive, pal.

1714
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,520
Most people,
they lose, they whine and quit.

1715
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,020
But you got to be there for the turns.

1716
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:34,560
Everybody's got good luck,
everybody's got bad luck.

1717
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:38,230
Don't run when you lose.
Don't whine when it hurts.

1718
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:40,280
It's like the first grade, Jerry.

1719
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,070
Nobody likes a crybaby.

1720
01:49:42,190 --> 01:49:44,990
-Whooshing sound.
-I'll take four of these.

1721
01:49:58,710 --> 01:50:00,840
Feels good to be back on top, huh?

1722
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:07,720
Hey, champ. What brings you to London?

1723
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:09,890
You, Gordo.

1724
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:14,310
You want to make one last trade?

1725
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,440
Well, that depends.

1726
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:20,360
Did you ever really want
to reconcile with her?

1727
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,740
I'm human.

1728
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:25,200
Then why did you do it?

1729
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,160
Well, it's the same answer.

1730
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,240
Look, I told you before, Winnie was gonna
stake me when I got out.

1731
01:50:30,830 --> 01:50:33,160
-You remember, she reneged.
-Sure, she did.

1732
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:36,170
It makes you feel better
about stealing from your own blood,

1733
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,670
doesn't it?

1734
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:39,790
Every thief has some excuse.

1735
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:42,670
Hey, don't you act so superior, kid.

1736
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:48,760
They took 122 thousand hours of my life
for a victimless crime.

1737
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:51,680
I ate my bitterness every goddamn day.

1738
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:53,430
And when I got out,
who was waiting for me?

1739
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:54,730
Nobody!

1740
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:57,650
Not even my own daughter.

1741
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,400
I thought Bretton was slime
until I met you.

1742
01:51:02,270 --> 01:51:04,780
I just never believed that a man
would sell out his own daughter.

1743
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,110
You die your way, I'll die mine.
Get the hell out of here.

1744
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:09,370
You know, she left me, Gordon.

1745
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,700
Yeah?

1746
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,250
I'm sorry about that.

1747
01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:16,460
Yeah? I bet you are.

1748
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,120
You left it all in ruins.

1749
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:24,420
But no matter how much money you make,
you'll never be rich.

1750
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:28,340
See, that's what you never got, kid.
It's not about the money.

1751
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:32,850
It's about the game.
The game between people.

1752
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:35,640
And that's all it is.

1753
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:39,560
Speaking of,

1754
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:43,020
what's the trade?

1755
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:47,490
You give back the principal to Winnie.
The $100 million.

1756
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,820
And what do I get in return?

1757
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:56,250
Put this in.

1758
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:15,640
That's your grandson.

1759
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:36,700
You said, "The most valuable commodity
I know is time."

1760
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:39,750
You're looking at time.

1761
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:41,750
Not money.

1762
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:46,550
This is time, Gordon.

1763
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:03,730
I'm sorry, Jake, but this is simply
a trade I cannot make.

1764
01:53:16,830 --> 01:53:18,950
You're a sad man, Gordon.

1765
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:34,780
You really want to get this site
on the map?

1766
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:38,570
You break this story.
It'll take some time, but it'll spread.

1767
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:41,240
It's the single greatest transfer
of wealth in American history

1768
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:43,700
from Main Street to Wall Street,
and it's all true.

1769
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:46,790
And it will happen again because people
like you and me want to be lied to.

1770
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,420
We like bedtime stories.

1771
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:56,180
I miss you like crazy,
and I love you, baby, and I'm sorry.

1772
01:55:40,590 --> 01:55:45,560
Bretton James, the rumor is that
he was shorting Keller Zabel stock

1773
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,180
before he ended up acquiring it.

1774
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:49,940
Why would he do that?
This is the rock star of Wall Street.

1775
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:51,110
Did you hear about Bretton James?

1776
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:54,280
CNBC will say he's hedging,
but if you ask me it's a fraud.

1777
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,900
It's a tiny website. Who cares?

1778
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:01,320
Gekko's daughter
and that smartass kid I fired, Moore.

1779
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:04,700
What is this about the rumor that led
to Louis Zabel committing suicide?

1780
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:07,870
Well, shorting his own company,
you can't bust him for that.

1781
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,420
But they can get him for running false
rumors on Zabel, that's serious.

1782
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,290
It's gone viral, Bretton.

1783
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,170
Bloomberg has a summary out on it.
Reuters is playing the story big.

1784
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:19,380
It's become legitimate. Congress is next.

1785
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:22,800
This bank is bigger than you, Bretton.

1786
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:26,430
We know
there's nothing illegal here, Jimmy.

1787
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:28,480
Jack?

1788
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:33,110
Julie...

1789
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,150
Are you stupid or what?

1790
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:39,110
Trading for your account in your position?

1791
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:43,160
You pigged out, kid.
You were making a fortune here.

1792
01:56:43,450 --> 01:56:45,740
What the hell is wrong with you?

1793
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:47,910
Come on.

1794
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:51,500
So I double-dipped.

1795
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:53,080
Who hasn't?

1796
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:56,380
Now, in your time,
you must have done some things.

1797
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:59,050
You're retiring, Julie.

1798
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:02,130
Why don't you step up in front of this?

1799
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:04,050
You can afford it.

1800
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,930
I can still run this place

1801
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:10,020
and make you more money
than you ever dreamed.

1802
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:16,730
We both know
that's not going to happen, kid.

1803
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:26,870
Julie.

1804
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:29,660
Think about this, please.

1805
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:31,660
You look for the birds.

1806
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:35,420
They're going to help you, those birds.
You'll see. Good luck.

1807
01:58:05,490 --> 01:58:08,410
I don't wanna sound like a rooster
taking credit for the dawn,

1808
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:12,620
but turning $100 million into $1 .1 billion

1809
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:15,500
in this market, takes some brains, right?

1810
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:18,500
My guys are good.

1811
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:22,880
And it's no wonder our new fund
is over-subscribed.

1812
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:27,430
But for you,
I'm gonna initiate a third fund.

1813
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:32,600
Because, frankly, Julie,
I couldn't be more excited about this.

1814
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:35,850
To finally be in business
with you and your firm.

1815
01:58:38,610 --> 01:58:41,110
And us with you, Gekko.

1816
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,200
Yeah.

1817
01:58:50,490 --> 01:58:52,910
<i>What is the definition of insanity?</i>

1818
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:58,750
<i>lt's doing the same thing over and over</i>
<i>and expecting a different result.</i>

1819
01:59:01,130 --> 01:59:04,130
<i>By that standard, most of us are insane.</i>

1820
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:06,220
<i>But not at the same time.</i>

1821
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:09,600
<i>And on that basis we trust.</i>

1822
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:13,060
<i>But can this way of life endure</i>

1823
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:16,480
<i>if more and more people</i>
<i>are insane at the same time?</i>

1824
01:59:18,190 --> 01:59:21,860
<i>lt becomes, as Gordon said, "Systemic. "</i>

1825
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:23,650
<i>Like cancer.</i>

1826
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,910
<i>What happens then?</i>

1827
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:32,120
<i>Like l said,</i>

1828
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:35,580
<i>the mother of all bubbles</i>
<i>was the Cambrian Explosion.</i>

1829
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,880
<i>And it happened by chance</i>
<i>over 500 million years ago.</i>

1830
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,500
-Louis Zabel, Bretton?
-Tell us about Louis Zabel.

1831
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:46,010
-Come on. Come on.
-No!

1832
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:50,930
<i>Scientists will tell you</i>
<i>it was unprecedented,</i>

1833
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:52,350
<i>it happened in a flash.</i>

1834
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:56,980
<i>And from it,</i>

1835
01:59:57,100 --> 02:00:00,650
<i>suddenly the world had</i>
<i>millions of new species.</i>

1836
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:02,940
I'd love a coffee. So be in, like, 10.

1837
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:04,780
<i>-And from that...</i>
-Where are you going?

1838
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:06,070
<i>...was born us.</i>

1839
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:07,190
Look at you!

1840
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:08,320
<i>The human race.</i>

1841
02:00:08,450 --> 02:00:11,200
Mr. Schwartz, I hear you are leaving us.

1842
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:13,530
No, that won't be soon enough.

1843
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:15,490
Have you thought
about a timeshare in Florida?

1844
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:17,120
I could hook you up in Boca.

1845
02:00:18,290 --> 02:00:20,000
Sit down, Mr. James.

1846
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:24,920
<i>Now, in that sense,</i>
<i>bubbles are evolutionary.</i>

1847
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:27,170
This is only a preliminary proceeding.

1848
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:29,090
But I want you to know
you're under investigation

1849
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:32,800
on accusations of tax evasion
and stock manipulation

1850
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:36,770
through, among others,
an entity called Locust Fund.

1851
02:00:36,890 --> 02:00:40,020
Although, I want to first get
to the matter of Louis Zabel.

1852
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:42,350
I see here that you cooperated
with this office

1853
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,480
and with the federal authorities in 1988

1854
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:49,030
when the investigations
of one Gordon Gekko began.

1855
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:50,780
<i>They kill excess.</i>

1856
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:53,700
<i>They lean out the herd.</i>

1857
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:56,120
<i>But they never die.</i>

1858
02:00:57,290 --> 02:00:59,620
<i>They just come back in different forms.</i>

1859
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,220
<i>When they burst,</i>

1860
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:13,510
<i>they give birth to a new day.</i>

1861
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:30,110
<i>Always creating change.</i>

1862
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:52,420
Can I carry that?

1863
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,600
You're not sleeping either?

1864
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:02,020
He woke me up last night.

1865
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:06,860
Yeah.

1866
02:02:07,650 --> 02:02:08,770
Can I?

1867
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:11,110
Yeah.

1868
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:23,500
There?

1869
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:25,210
Yeah.

1870
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,130
I just got off the phone with Dr. Masters.

1871
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:36,640
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1872
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,100
Very happy man.

1873
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:42,060
Renewed interests from investors.

1874
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:44,020
Because of your story.

1875
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,060
So, thank you.

1876
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:52,150
I miss you, Winnie.

1877
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:54,990
I miss you.

1878
02:02:57,990 --> 02:03:00,160
I don't know how to fix this.

1879
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:03,410
Neither do I.

1880
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,500
It's different now.

1881
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:10,250
-What can I do? I mean, I...
-Nothing.

1882
02:03:12,210 --> 02:03:13,420
Nothing.

1883
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:24,480
Thank you.

1884
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:27,270
-Good night.
-Good night.

1885
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,440
Where are you two going?

1886
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:49,710
What, nobody around here
believes in comebacks?

1887
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:57,550
Winn, I owe you something.

1888
02:03:59,050 --> 02:04:01,720
I don't want it. I never did.

1889
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:04,640
No, I figured that.

1890
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:08,640
But, you know,
when choosing between two evils,

1891
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:13,570
I like to try the one
that I haven't tried before.

1892
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:19,200
So I deposited a check of $100 million

1893
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:23,120
made out to United Fusion.

1894
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:29,710
From some offshore fund
no one needs to know about.

1895
02:04:31,290 --> 02:04:34,340
Wouldn't you say green
is the new bubble, Jake?

1896
02:04:43,930 --> 02:04:45,970
You two make a nice couple.

1897
02:04:53,770 --> 02:04:57,320
You know, Winn, human beings,

1898
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:01,910
we got to give them a break.

1899
02:05:04,070 --> 02:05:05,780
We're all mixed bags.

1900
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:13,960
But

1901
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,420
my grandson,

1902
02:05:19,130 --> 02:05:20,420
and you...

1903
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:26,060
And maybe, you know,
you'll let me be a father again.

1904
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:13,410
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, what's the matter?

1905
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:15,290
You guys are like the last two
on a ship that is sinking.

1906
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:22,800
That's pretty.

1907
02:07:23,050 --> 02:07:25,220
Isn't that a Cracker Jack box ring?
