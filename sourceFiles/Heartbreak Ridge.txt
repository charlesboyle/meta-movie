1
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,650
-Here's that 410.
-Right, Moe. Thanks.

2
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,744
I've been pumping pussy
since Christ was a corporal.

3
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:12,167
I've gotta tell you, the best poontang
I ever paid for was in Da Nang.

4
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,337
The girls were checked out daily.

5
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:20,008
And we got laid in a safe, orderly,
proficient, military manner.

6
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,262
Until some suckhead
writes home to Mama...

7
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:27,140
...and says he dipped his wick
in the Republic of--

8
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,602
Well, then the shit hits the fan.

9
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,314
A committee of congressmen,
who, asshole to asshole...

10
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,733
...couldn't make a beer fart
in a whirlwind...

11
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:41,613
...starts telling your basic ass-in-the-grass
Marine, "No more short time."

12
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,825
We respond in true
Marine Corps fashion.

13
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,702
We salute and do an about-face...

14
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,080
...double-time back to
the boom-boom garbage dump...

15
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,792
...where we proceed to get
the clap, the drip, the crabs...

16
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,630
...and generally a poor attitude
towards the female of the species.

17
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,426
War is hell, boy. That's a fact.

18
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,554
I don't like soldier boys.

19
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,890
Say what?

20
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:13,937
You wanna pop that puppy's can, you
don't gotta grease him so hard, jarhead.

21
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,027
Sounds like you're a man
of experience.

22
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,362
What the fuck's that mean, grunt-shit?

23
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,658
It means be advised
that I'm mean, nasty and tired.

24
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,411
I eat concertina wire
and piss napalm.

25
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,123
I can put a round through
a flea's ass at 200 meters.

26
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:37,127
So you go hump somebody else's leg,
mutt-face, before I push yours in.

27
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,423
Ain't gonna be so smart with your
balls stuffed in your mouth, jarhead.

28
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,092
Oh, shit.

29
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:49,681
Hang on to this, boy.
I think war's just been declared.

30
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,567
Why don't you just sit there and bleed
a while before you taste some real pain?

31
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:09,326
Maybe first I carve me
some faggot wings.

32
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,536
He'll kill him.

33
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:35,394
Then again, there was
this dusky gal in Bangkok.

34
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,647
A real crossway breezer, I swear.

35
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,652
Thank you for your testimony,
Officer Reese.

36
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,950
Sergeant Highway.

37
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,786
Drunk and disorderly.

38
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,664
Fighting in a public establishment.

39
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,793
Urinating on a police vehicle.

40
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,968
Well, it seemed like the thing to do, sir.

41
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,182
Just because there's no war going on...

42
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,769
...doesn't give you the right to start one
every time you get drunk.

43
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:23,191
I'm taking into account
your excellent military record...

44
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,446
...and your commitment
to the security of this great nation.

45
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:32,200
But this is your last chance.

46
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,621
One-hundred-dollar fine. Next.

47
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,468
Your nightstick file for divorce, Reese?

48
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,639
Who do you think you are,
pissing on my squad car?

49
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,642
Think you can break our rules
and just walk away?

50
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,730
We're supposed to wet our pants over
your dress blues and colored ribbons?

51
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,941
Read your file sometime, hero.
Check the dates.

52
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:09,654
It's ancient history. One night,
you'll be puking blood in an alley.

53
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,365
You'll look up, see me.
Then we'll see.

54
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,076
-Keep dreaming.
-You'll pay full price.

55
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:20,457
-I don't give a serviceman's discount.
-Too bad. Your old lady does.

56
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,803
Just about cleaned you out.

57
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:39,100
Makes you feel good, doesn't it,
helping Uncle Sam battle dirty drawers?

58
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,522
Just pump the dog again, Jake,
or are you always that slack-eyed?

59
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,274
Looks like you could use a lift.

60
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:51,947
Suck on this. Smooth as a prom
queen's thighs, only not so risky.

61
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,450
Havana cured.
Got a pal in Guantánamo in Supply.

62
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,789
We do each other favors. I got lots
of friends. I can always use another.

63
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,334
-So we can do each other favors?
-Yeah, sure.

64
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,965
If your pencil wasn't so sharp and your
eyesight not so clear around here....

65
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,051
I could make your lot in military life
a lot comfier...

66
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,178
...not to mention downright rewarding.

67
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,516
You get that contraband stogy
out of my face...

68
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,895
...before I shove it so far up your ass you'll
have to set fire to your nose to light it.

69
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,773
Gunny Highway. Major Devin
wants to see you ASAP.

70
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,783
-At ease. That will be all, sergeant major.
-Aye, aye, sir.

71
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,494
For chrissakes, Highway, relax.

72
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,080
Stop being so gung ho.

73
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,082
That's what I am, sir.

74
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,878
What do you got now, about 24,
don't you?

75
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,839
And then some, sir.

76
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,260
Some men in your position
would look forward to retirement.

77
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,347
Maybe take the wives on
a round-the-world cruise.

78
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,391
But that's not your way, is it?

79
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:06,896
You choose to harangue my staff
with a request for transfer to a...

80
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,107
...Fleet Marine Force unit.

81
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,527
The very unit you got busted out of
some time ago...

82
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,697
...for insubordination.
Conduct unbecoming.

83
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,452
That's true. I have had my differences
with some limp dicks.

84
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,703
Highway!

85
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:28,293
I truly don't know whether to admire you
or resent the living hell out of you.

86
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,881
Either way, it doesn't matter.
You're out of here immediately.

87
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,425
What did I do?

88
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,596
Second Recon Battalion.

89
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,724
Second Marine Division.
You're going home.

90
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,810
Aye, aye, sir.

91
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,483
Gunny Highway.

92
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,652
Sir?

93
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,947
Be careful what you wish for.
You might just get it.

94
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,411
Whoa! Hut!

95
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:29,020
We're gonna bring up the last victim.
A true-blood, born in Jersey.

96
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,649
He's the president of punk,
the earl of funk.

97
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,487
Here he is, the next king of rock 'n' roll,
ladies and gentlemen, Stitch Jones!

98
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,198
Stitch Jones?

99
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,793
Whoa, whoa.

100
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,589
Do I mess with y'all all when
you play "Romance the Sheep"?

101
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,634
Bag these geeks.
Keep America beautiful.

102
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:04,055
-Put a 10-gallon bag over their head.
-Let's take care of this.

103
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,351
You look like the twin towers
gone cellulite. Heh-heh-heh.

104
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,731
I can play country western.
Give me a chance.

105
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,526
I know Merle Haggard,
the Beverly Hillbillies.

106
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,195
Come on, man. I need the money!

107
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,785
-How far?
-About two stops.

108
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,245
Shit.

109
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,324
You the maid?

110
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,744
I want the seat, but the shit
ain't worth dying over.

111
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,746
Hell. You know.

112
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:56,000
Liz and Dick. Lennon and McCartney,
even. Ali and Frazier.

113
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,169
They worked it out. So can we.

114
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,090
Stitch Jones is the name.
Rocking and rapping is the game.

115
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,092
Pleased to meet you too.

116
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:09,806
Banged up my Corvette. But I figure
it's a chance to meet regular people...

117
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,809
...dudes like yourself.
People like my fans.

118
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,688
I'm a singer. Stitch Jones.
Earl of funk. Duke of cool.

119
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,442
-Ayatollah of rock 'n' roll-ah.
-Shut your face, hippie.

120
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,319
You say "hippie," man?

121
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:29,534
Ain't been no hippies for centuries.
You been freeze-dried or doing time?

122
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,829
Whew.

123
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,665
One of those would sure go down nice.

124
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,879
I'd buy one from you, but I don't
have my plastic. Usually my lackeys--

125
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,882
You can have one, if it shuts
the hole under your nose.

126
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,676
Ah. Thank you, my friend.

127
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,346
Jones.

128
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,475
This doesn't mean you can
blow in my ear. Tom Highway.

129
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,562
Yo, man, these ain't your magazines.

130
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,691
Somebody must have left them there.

131
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,612
"The Sexual Politics of Living Alone."

132
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,200
"The Big Commitment and You." Ah.

133
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:15,663
"Island Erotics: How to Stay Tan,
Tickly, and Tantalized...

134
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,332
...in the Cool Waters of Jamaica."

135
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,833
Not bad, man.

136
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,211
Ahh.

137
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,550
"Sunday Sex with a Wednesday Lover."

138
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,012
Yo, man, that sounds like a song.
Check it out.

139
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,848
I met her on a Wednesday
She was the best

140
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,601
Come Sunday morning
I needed rest

141
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,020
'Cause she didn't shave,
She didn't use Neet

142
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,356
Tried to use my face
As a bicycle seat

143
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,276
Word! Am I fresh?

144
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,278
Ahh. Ugh.

145
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:52,200
This chick's got some angry titties.
Hostile projectiles.

146
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,621
-Put your shit in, you get frostbite.
-She isn't so bad.

147
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,458
You wanna talk, I'll listen,
but don't try to sell Stitch Jones...

148
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:05,046
...on making love or making music,
because I'm an authority. Born to screw...

149
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,050
...and bred to sing. That's me.
Now, I've gotta cut some Z's.

150
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,054
So if you don't mind, keep down
the chatter while I get my beauty sleep.

151
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,779
Groupies are fun, but you need
vitamin E. They wear you out.

152
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,573
-Anything else, general?
-No, I'm fine.

153
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,952
What are all those medals?

154
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,956
I'll never tell. At least
not while the sun's shining.

155
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,462
This babe is wack.

156
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,091
She doesn't know what's
12 inches long and white.

157
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,634
Nothing!

158
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,638
Hey, man, no offense.
Just working on my routine.

159
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,809
I'll tell you what's black and bleeding
if it don't shut its face.

160
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,645
Mellow, man. It's gonna be a nice day.

161
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:11,571
-Tell the driver I'll be right out.
-I'm gonna use my plastic. My treat.

162
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,282
Well, thanks. I'll get the tip.

163
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,414
Oh, uh....

164
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,586
My buddy's gonna take care of that.
He said to tell you:

165
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,006
"There's no sun shining
in the men's john."

166
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,646
I'm here, baby,
let's do some distance.

167
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,326
Son of a bitch.

168
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,202
Hey, crotch rot.

169
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,580
Gonna slurp my lifer's juice
out of my own cup?

170
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,251
Yeah, I guess I should have
gotten shots beforehand.

171
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,464
If your brain was as quick as your
mouth, you'd be a 20-star general.

172
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:59,887
If I was half as ugly as you,
I'd be a poster boy for a prophylactic.

173
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,223
Still a mean and nasty bastard.

174
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,061
Good to see you, Tom.
Back where you belong!

175
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,231
Take it easy. Everybody's
gonna think I'm spoken for.

176
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,067
Ten-hut.

177
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,735
Morning, sir.

178
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,404
Sergeant major.

179
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,739
Coffee, sir?

180
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,950
Negative.

181
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,453
Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway
reporting for duty, sir.

182
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:33,129
That operation officer's farthole is
sewed so tight he shits out of his mouth.

183
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,422
Academy?

184
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,091
Big-time football hero.

185
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,386
-When am I ever gonna get a break?
-Never.

186
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,763
-Sergeant major.
-Sir!

187
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,600
Bring in Gunnery Sergeant Highway.

188
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,780
Been in a long time.

189
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,617
I've felt a little heat, sir.

190
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:07,288
Korean. Dominican in '65.
Three tours in Nam.

191
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:12,585
Hell, he's carrying so much shrapnel,
he can't pass through a metal detector.

192
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,714
I haven't as yet
had the privilege of combat.

193
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,969
I came over from Supply and Logistics.

194
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,556
An unappreciated field of endeavor, sir.

195
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,975
Quite.

196
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,063
My record of achievement
thus far has been exemplary...

197
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,649
...and I fully intend for that to continue.

198
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,150
Sir.

199
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,613
I want this battalion
to be the class of the division.

200
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,450
I expect my non-commissioned officers
to lead by example.

201
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,664
Public fighting and insubordination to
civilian authority are not good standards.

202
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,919
-It was a minor altercation, sir.
-You make a habit of doing that.

203
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:59,882
A year ago you hit an officer.
I went to Annapolis with that man.

204
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:05,513
You try that with me and you'll drag your
butt in a sling for a month. You hear me?

205
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,682
Yes, sir.

206
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:14,188
I don't know what strings you pulled to get
back in this division, but I don't like it.

207
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,065
This is the new Marine Corps.

208
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,652
A new breed.

209
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,363
Characters like you are an anachronism.

210
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:29,537
You should be sealed in a case that reads,
"Break glass only in the event of war."

211
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,040
No tolerance for old-timers who think...

212
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,127
...you know better and can
have it your way. Understand?

213
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:42,049
I understand a lot of body bags
get filled if I don't do my job, sir.

214
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,759
Major.

215
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:48,556
Division has assigned Highway
to our reconnaissance platoon.

216
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,105
Yes, recon.

217
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,943
My last sergeant was
an old-time combat vet too.

218
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,487
But he went R.O.A.D. on me.

219
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,990
Retired On Active Duty.

220
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,160
Had a few months to retirement,
figured he'd coast.

221
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,996
Allowed the men lapse into mediocrity.

222
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,251
You're close to mandatory retirement
yourself, aren't you?

223
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,671
That's right, major.

224
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,593
Well, I ask for Marines...

225
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,262
...the division sends me relics.

226
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,105
The men in Recon Platoon are less than
highly motivated, to say the least.

227
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,274
And I want those men in shape.

228
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,862
I'll make life-takers and
heartbreakers out of them, sir.

229
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,158
Dismissed.

230
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,249
Is he always like that or
just trying to make a good impression?

231
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,753
He consults his manual
before he mounts his old lady...

232
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,214
...to ensure he performs in an orderly--

233
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,882
Proficient military manner.

234
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,134
Chow with Helen and me tonight.

235
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,304
Later, we go stomp some brain cells
and tell some story.

236
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,809
-I'd like to, but I better get organized.
-Sure, I understand.

237
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,145
Oh. Excuse me, sir.

238
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,899
I mean, gunny. Sergeant major.

239
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,778
This is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.
He's been assigned to Recon Platoon.

240
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:30,741
Oh. Outstanding, welcome aboard.
Well, I gotta hightail it.

241
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,993
I'm late for pre-scuba school.

242
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,662
Lord.

243
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,206
His mama know he's playing Marine?

244
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,293
By the way, he's Lieutenant Ring,
your platoon leader.

245
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,628
Thanks a lot.

246
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:46,674
You didn't think you was just gonna tilt
nipple to a bunch of no-rank fuzzbutts?

247
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,177
-Want me to intro you to your troops?
-No, no, that's all right.

248
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,347
-Take my pickup.
-Hey, thanks. Where is it?

249
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,226
Just tell by the sign.
It says: "Sergeant major."

250
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,366
Is this Recon Platoon?

251
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,702
No speak English.

252
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,537
You?

253
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,195
My name is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.

254
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:54,575
I've drunk more beer, pissed more blood,
banged more quiff, busted more...

255
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,579
...than all you numb-nuts put together.

256
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:03,167
-Major Powers has put me in charge.
-We take care of ourselves.

257
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,170
You couldn't take care of a wet dream.

258
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,214
-God loves you.
-I know that.

259
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,341
You men do not impress me!

260
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,511
Recon Platoon kicks butt.

261
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,766
-Ow.
-If you ladies think you can slip and slide...

262
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,768
...because your last sergeant was a pussy...

263
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,438
...who was just marking the days,
well, queer bait...

264
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,859
-...start acting like Marines right now.
-Who invited you?

265
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,696
I'm not doing this because I wanna
take long showers with you assholes.

266
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,283
And I don't wanna get my head
shot off in some faraway land...

267
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,953
...because you don't habla.
Comprende?

268
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,287
Oorah!

269
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,497
-You?
-Yes, gunny.

270
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,875
I think you're fine

271
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,879
And you got that big behind

272
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,349
Well, well, well, well.

273
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:07,690
I'm here to tell you all
that life as you know it has ended.

274
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:13,070
You might as well all go to town tonight.
Laugh and make fools of yourself.

275
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,992
Rub your pathetic little peckers up against
your honey, or stick it in a knothole.

276
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:22,329
Whatever it is, get rid of it,
because at 0600 tomorrow...

277
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,999
...your ass is mine.

278
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,834
Where's your bunk?

279
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,170
Yo, man. Come on!

280
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,423
What the hell's going on?

281
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,178
Aah! Aah!

282
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:42,474
This is gonna mess up your karma, man.
It's gonna haunt you in your next life.

283
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,270
-Let's have it.
-What?

284
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,274
-The money from my ticket.
-No need to use violence, man.

285
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:54,403
I'm a peace lover. I was down
with the money on my luck.

286
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,239
Yeah. I got a little money right here.

287
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,617
-That's all I got.
-And the meal?

288
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,452
-Meal?
-Yeah, the meal.

289
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,078
All right.

290
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,040
-That's really all I got.
-And the tip.

291
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,709
-That's really it, man. Aah!
-You owe me.

292
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,132
Now, it's my will against yours.
And you will lose.

293
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,635
So 0600 tomorrow.

294
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:22,222
That's 6:00 in the morning for
all you people who don't habla.

295
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,976
Damn! He just tore off my ear.

296
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,729
Lucky he had a chance to escape
before I kick his ass.

297
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,857
Big leatherneck,
jarhead motherfucker.

298
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,236
-Something's gonna have to be done.
-What are we gonna do?

299
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,783
-Wait till the Swede gets out of the brig.
-That's it. The Swede, man.

300
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,411
-He'll rip his head off and dump in it!
-Then eat it.

301
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,915
-I would've done that.
-Goodbye, Highway!

302
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,917
Swede! Swede! Swede!

303
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,432
Hey, baby.

304
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,934
I called his wife--

305
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,478
You fool around on the first date?

306
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,774
Oh....

307
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,782
Damn you, boy.
Don't you know how to write or call?

308
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,993
I didn't wanna cause you
any sleepless nights, thinking about me.

309
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,664
-I'll get you a beer.
-Great. I could use one.

310
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,791
That's for sure.

311
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,835
You look great.

312
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,130
They don't make them
like you anymore, sweetheart.

313
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,924
Oh, hell. Sure they do.

314
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,553
But if you want a lot from a woman,
you have to give a lot.

315
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,726
Not this kid. It seemed marriage and
the Marine Corps weren't too compatible.

316
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,980
Panther piss. The best years
of my life were with a Marine.

317
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:57,651
If I was a little younger, I'd make you
eat your words and curl your toes.

318
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,319
Yeah, I'll bet you could.

319
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,115
Aggie always kept a smile
on your face.

320
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,242
That was pain.

321
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,827
Tom, she's in town.

322
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,833
Hmm. Well, I figured as much.

323
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:18,172
If she's looking for more alimony,
I'm so broke I couldn't get out of sight...

324
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,924
...if it took a quarter
to go around the world.

325
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,594
She's cocktailing over at the Palace.

326
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,182
I figured she'd be married
to a general by now.

327
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,392
Uh....

328
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,020
Can I get my old room back?

329
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:37,357
-Hell, yes. Are you gonna see her?
-Hell, no. Can I run a tab?

330
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,401
Hell, no.

331
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,695
Tough woman.

332
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,767
And now, back from an awesomely
successful tour...

333
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,562
...the earl of funk,
the duke of cool...

334
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,607
...the ayatollah of rock 'n' roll-ah:

335
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,567
Stitch Jones!

336
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,788
Stop telling me what to do

337
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,083
And that goes for your mama too

338
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,920
Ask me and I'll tell the truth
He-hey

339
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:44,174
You need to call up Dr. Ruth

340
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,928
Girl, you know I love you
But I ain't stupid

341
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,098
Said you know I love you
But I ain't stupid

342
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,349
Don't be illin'

343
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,726
I'm just chillin'
No need to make a killin'

344
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,272
A kiss is just as thrillin'
And I'm still willin'

345
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,984
So forget all about it
Baby, we can do without it

346
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:06,113
Yo, if you shout about it
Believe it, don't doubt it

347
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,283
Your daddy works at IBM, baby

348
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,452
So good for you
Good for them

349
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,583
Baby
Your brother says he's being nice

350
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,376
I don't need his free advice

351
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,462
Girl, you know I love you--

352
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,798
Okay, what will it--?

353
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,634
Aggie.

354
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,140
-What do you want?
-A beer.

355
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,894
-What are you doing here?
-Ordering.

356
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,314
Shake it, don't break it
No need for you to fake it

357
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,691
I know we can make it

358
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,485
Girl, you know I'll turn you out

359
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,156
Make me scream
I need to shout

360
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,619
Kiss me
And you make my day

361
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,829
I love it when you talk that way

362
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,584
You even remembered the brand.

363
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:04,755
Bad whiskey, bad sex and bad men,
I never forget.

364
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,007
You didn't talk dirty like that
when we were married.

365
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,677
Heh. Always. Only you were never there
to hear it.

366
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,182
-Look, Tom, I'm working.
-Hey.

367
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,850
You look great.

368
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,270
-The lights are low.
-No, I mean it.

369
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,524
-I'd recognize you coming and going.
-Save the banter for your bimbos.

370
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,778
It's late, I'm tired, my feet hurt.
What are you doing here?

371
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,530
I'm back with recon.

372
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,201
And you just happened to wander
into the joint? Ain't life grand?

373
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,372
-I didn't come here to fight.
-You mean old dogs do learn new tricks?

374
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:42,084
I just come here for a beer,
and you're ragging my ass already.

375
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,629
Aggie, is there a problem here?

376
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:50,342
No, as a matter of fact, I'd like you
to meet one of my favorite exes.

377
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,429
This is Thomas Highway. This is
Roy Jennings, he owns the Palace now.

378
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:01,603
Heard all about you.
And your bullshit heroics.

379
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,440
Uh-- Uh-- Tom is just gonna leave. Heh.

380
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,989
Aggie, I'll take you home
after we close up...

381
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,908
...as usual.

382
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,253
You sure can pick them, I'll tell you.

383
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,588
Hah. Look who's talking.

384
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,261
Ah, you know I love you

385
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,806
Oh, please
And I ain't crazy neither, hah!

386
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,273
All right.

387
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,821
I'm gonna play something from N.Y.C.
I want all of you to rock the house!

388
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,781
Why don't you get your hair cut, huh?

389
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,581
You're so ugly, you need to be out
at the airport sniffing luggage.

390
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,417
-You think you're funny?
-Tell you what:

391
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,919
Y'all, cross your legs,
hold your noses and fart.

392
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,464
-You could clear out your minds.
-Say what?

393
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,133
Yo, yo, yo! Tell you what.

394
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:17,137
Don't start no S-H,
won't be no I-T. We got ladies here.

395
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,724
Point yourselves this way, have a drink
with the nation's finest.

396
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,100
-All right.
-Chill out.

397
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,351
Hoo! Hoo!

398
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,105
Knock it off! I said knock it off,
goddamn it!

399
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,066
Sit down, buddy!

400
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,944
-Why don't you lay off them?
-Why don't you stay out of this?

401
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,531
-It's none of your business.
-What are you, some kind of smart-mouth?

402
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,869
-I'm just trying to sing here.
-You get off on rousting Marines?

403
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,371
Leave it alone.
It doesn't concern you.

404
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,750
-I chew on jarheads and spit them out.
-You do?

405
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,420
Why don't I bend you over that table
then, and nail you in the keister?

406
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:54,132
-What are you talking about?
-That's what your persuasion is.

407
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,345
I'll send you home with an "I just pumped
the neighbor's cat" look on your face.

408
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,518
-What kind of faggot talk is that?
-You have no right to do this.

409
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,021
Roy, man.
He's just pulling your leg, man.

410
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:12,359
They don't mean nothing. Who'd have
the bad sense to fuck with Roy Jennings?

411
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,529
I mean, welcome to fantasy disco, huh?

412
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,365
The hell with both of you.

413
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,119
And you're out, Jones. Hit the road.

414
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,621
And you watch it, funny man.

415
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,376
Get your tight little butt out of here.

416
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,593
-I never want to see you in this place again.
-I left my beer.

417
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:42,055
-I have got a future here, damn it!
-Cocktailing?

418
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,182
No, with Roy.

419
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,727
Maybe I expect better
out of an ex-wife of mine.

420
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,397
He's an improvement over you!

421
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,406
I don't believe this shit, man!

422
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,617
I'd have kicked Roy's ass
if I wasn't protecting you.

423
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:07,080
Redneck people love me.
So you owe me one. I saved your life.

424
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:11,251
This doesn't mean we're gonna be
swapping spit in the shower.

425
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,505
Fuck this jarhead sucker.

426
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,092
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

427
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,887
Off your ass and on your feet.
Get up!

428
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,805
Knees to the breeze in five minutes.

429
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,810
-It's goddamn 5:00. You said 6:00.
-So I can't tell time. So I lied.

430
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,607
Maybe some communist's gonna make an
appointment to pop you a new asshole.

431
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:38,278
Let's go! Move out! You're Marines
now. You improvise. You adapt.

432
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,822
Four minutes. Fall out.

433
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,782
Shit.

434
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,661
We move swift. We move
silent. We move deadly.

435
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:52,125
Only one shake of those wangs.
Any more than that constitutes pleasure.

436
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,503
-Sleep well?
-Man, this is a nightmare!

437
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,130
Wake me up, Mama!

438
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:04,346
-Gunny, platoon's formed for PT.
-Take your post.

439
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:10,435
The Marines are looking
for a few good men.

440
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,772
Unfortunately you ain't it.

441
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,818
We will blaze a path into battle
for others to follow.

442
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,322
Surrender is not in our creed.
Let's hear you say that.

443
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,742
Surrender is not in our creed.

444
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:30,497
Louder, or next time you get R and R,
you'll be collecting pensions.

445
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,083
-Surrender is not in our creed.
-Louder!

446
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,585
Surrender is not in our creed!

447
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,505
Oorah.

448
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,007
-Strip off those T-shirts.
-What?

449
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,759
What's he talking about?

450
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,554
You'll all wear the same T-shirts
or none at all.

451
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,644
-Shit....
-He's crazy.

452
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,031
-What's your name, Marine?
-Lance Corporal Fragetti, gunny.

453
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:19,587
You shouldn't litter, Fag-etti.
It's ecologically unsound.

454
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,383
What's your name?

455
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,051
-Aponte.
-Yours?

456
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,261
-Profile.
-Yours?

457
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,804
-Quinones.
-Yours?

458
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,556
Collins.

459
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,978
All right, Colitis, Cojones...

460
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,439
...Prophylactic, Ajax.

461
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,941
You boys are handsome.

462
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,985
You ladies look like models.

463
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,531
I want your hair high and tight
tomorrow morning. Everybody.

464
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,702
When you start looking like Marines,
you'll feel like Marines...

465
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:56,666
...and pretty soon you'll act like
Marines. Right face! Forward march!

466
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,754
Left, your left, your left,
right, left....

467
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,973
Left, right, left, right, left....

468
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,899
When my boy Swede gets out of the brig,
this sucker's dead.

469
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,069
-You got that right, bro!
-Right on!

470
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,613
Ooh-oh-oh-oh!

471
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,573
Ooh-oh-oh-oh!

472
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,327
-Whoa-ho-ho.
-Turn right!

473
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,287
Mama, Mama, can't you see

474
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,873
What the Marine Corps has done to me

475
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,917
What the Marine Corps has done to me

476
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,044
Used to drive a Chevrolet

477
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,088
Used to drive a Chevrolet

478
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,131
Now I'm marching every day

479
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,302
Cojones, give us a cadence.

480
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,598
Your girlfriend's gonna weep
when I bite that finger off.

481
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,060
-Give me a cadence now!
-I don't remember any.

482
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,897
Think fast or I'll run your ass
until midnight.

483
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,818
Do it, man! This dude is certifiable.

484
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,577
Model A Ford and a tank full of gas

485
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,289
Model A Ford and a tank full of gas

486
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,335
Handful of pussy and a mouthful of ass

487
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,797
Handful of pussy and a mouthful of ass

488
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,408
Yo, man, what's this sucker, lost?

489
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,373
What's he gonna invade, South Carolina?

490
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,877
All right, men, let's smoke
this sucker's ass. Come on!

491
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,572
Asshole.

492
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,241
What did they put in his Geritol?

493
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,248
Lieutenant.

494
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:46,252
Oh. Gunny. Good morning.
Missed you and Recon Platoon at PT.

495
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,923
-The men and I were getting acquainted.
-Excellent.

496
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,426
I want to freelance them for a while.
To evaluate them.

497
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,430
There's nothing on the schedule.
You want me to join you?

498
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,099
You have important work here.

499
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:05,271
I am preparing a paper on tactics
and strategy for the War Club seminar.

500
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,274
Oh, it's fascinating stuff. Ow.

501
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,110
I don't know if the major told you...

502
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,447
...but I was commanding officer
of my ROTC detachment in college.

503
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,118
I'll sleep better at night
knowing that.

504
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,664
Thank you.
What college did you go to?

505
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,208
Heartbreak Ridge.

506
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:30,964
Heartbreak Ridge?
I've never heard of that school.

507
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,471
Shit!

508
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,665
Oh, yeah, that looks nice. Real nice.

509
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,375
Oh, yeah.

510
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,877
Slick.

511
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,632
Smells like a Ben Gay
factory around here.

512
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,884
Strip off those T-shirts.

513
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,304
-We're all the same.
-Same as me?

514
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:23,641
-How are we supposed to know--?
-You improvise, overcome, adapt.

515
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:27,145
Now, get off those goddamned
T-shirts now.

516
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,318
Platoon, right face.

517
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,486
Forward march!

518
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:52,211
You'd get away with that with Tyler.
But this cat, he's nuts. He'll catch you.

519
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,715
Don't worry yourself.

520
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,927
Hey, man, the few, the proud,
the chumps.

521
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,520
-Oh, no!
-Man, we can't win for losing.

522
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,191
He must have the key to the PX.

523
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,693
Anybody else got a better idea?

524
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,077
Where's Aponte?

525
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,790
He's sick, man. He looked like
living proof of life after death.

526
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,375
Went to get checked out.

527
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,460
-That's right, gunny.
-Yeah.

528
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,674
I want the barracks field-dayed
and squared away ASAP today.

529
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,593
We cleaned them just a while ago.

530
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,929
Yeah, gunny, you know, it's Saturday.

531
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,224
Well, let's have a show of hands.

532
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,227
How many people think the squad bay
is ready to go as is?

533
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:53,272
-Yeah!
-There you have it. Democracy in action.

534
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,192
-All right.
-We'll run instead. Attention!

535
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,736
Right face!

536
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,947
Forward march!

537
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,741
Double time!

538
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,477
What the hell's going on, man?

539
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:35,273
This is the AK-47.
The preferred weapon of your enemy.

540
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:39,652
And it makes a distinctive sound
when fired. So remember it.

541
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,158
Let's move out.

542
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,498
Oh, man, that's bullshit, man.

543
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:57,253
He's shooting at us. What the fuck?
I don't need this, man.

544
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,505
That's wrong, man.

545
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:04,177
Yo, you all, check the way he's always
squinting his eyes.

546
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,137
Trying to talk all tough.

547
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,265
I should slap him myself
just to call his bluff.

548
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,810
Don't do that, man
He's just a jarhead fool

549
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,353
You're right.
But hold me back

550
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:18,107
In case I lose my cool
Because we're the Recon Platoon

551
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,026
We always gung ho

552
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,861
Gung ho to party

553
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,697
-Or watch The Late Show
-Till Highway came along

554
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:28,159
His abuse we don't need
But we'll end this bullshit

555
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,537
When Highway meets the Swede

556
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,585
-He gonna kick his ass.
-Right!

557
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,728
-Highway, I heard you were back.
-Webster.

558
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,732
These retards couldn't fight their way
out of a shithouse.

559
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,651
Is that where you've been?

560
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:48,155
Me and Major Powers are building
an elite company of fighting men.

561
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:52,743
The only thing you could build
is a good case of hemorrhoids.

562
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:03,337
-What?
-You're blowing all your ammunition.

563
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,299
Mr. "I hate Americans" will make you
into Swiss cheese.

564
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,260
-Slow down your fire.
-It's not my fucking fault.

565
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,179
The fucking weapon
is fucking fucked up.

566
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,398
Nothing wrong with that rifle.
Keep it tight.

567
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,323
Did you wake up
with a piss-pot on your head?

568
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,328
-No, gunny, I wore this in your honor.
-Is that so?

569
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,122
This is a classic piece of issue.

570
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:42,877
You know, sands of Iwo Jima, Khe Sanh.
All that old antique stuff.

571
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:47,632
A nice tribute to an aging veteran
as close to retirement as yourself.

572
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,050
I'm touched.

573
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,638
You know, a recon way of saying
welcome and, inevitably, goodbye.

574
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,724
And the Kevlar helmet you were issued?

575
00:48:56,892 --> 00:49:00,853
That didn't by chance find its way
into a pawnshop in town, did it?

576
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,441
No way. That's a serious implication.

577
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,320
-We're responsible for these.
-That's right, you are.

578
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:14,533
So I want Kevlar on your head by 1900
or you won't have a head to wear it on.

579
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,622
Yes, sir, Gunny Highway,
sergeant, sir.

580
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,291
Gunny, my weapon's jammed.

581
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,046
-What the--?
-Oh, shit!

582
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,675
Asshole.

583
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,760
-What the--?
-You all right?

584
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,073
Major Powers is gonna teach you
how to discipline your men.

585
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:59,078
If Powers ever comes to a sudden halt,
your face is gonna go halfway up his ass.

586
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,750
Profile won't make it back
to the barracks.

587
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,253
Powers is cold-blooded, man.

588
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,341
Left...

589
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,051
...right...

590
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,262
...left.

591
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,893
Come on, Profile.

592
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,105
Don't give the prick the satisfaction.
You can make it.

593
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,942
Recon!

594
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,197
What did you say, gunner sergeant?

595
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:40,619
I said, "Don't give the prick
the satisfaction," sir.

596
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:49,045
"Sensitive dialogue during
communication of the relationship--"

597
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,472
-Follow you home?
-Sure, why not?

598
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,500
Come on, guys.
Somebody see what shirt he's wearing.

599
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:32,004
It don't matter, he'll find something
to complain about anyway.

600
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:36,217
Life was a hell of a lot easier
before Frankenstein paid a visit.

601
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,011
How am I gonna play American Bandstand?

602
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,680
This macho shit is bad for my hands.

603
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,100
People, fall out.

604
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,231
I said fall out. Now!

605
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,442
We ain't going no place.

606
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,904
-All this play-war stuff is bullshit!
-Yeah.

607
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,741
Gunny, this is all a question
of mind over matter.

608
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,702
We no longer mind
because you don't matter.

609
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,707
You've been voted out of office, baby.

610
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,501
Mr. Jones...

611
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,547
...you fall out on that street or
I'm gonna kick your ass off this planet.

612
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,424
Oh, I don't think so, babe. Swede?

613
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,052
Swede, Swede, Swede....

614
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,189
Ah. Gunny, I'd like you to meet
my big friend, Swede Johanson.

615
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,781
Swede, say something charming
to the man.

616
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,534
I'm gonna rip your head off
and shit down your neck.

617
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,915
See, Grungy Highway, we ain't got
no use for you no more.

618
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,876
Hit the road, Jack.

619
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,377
And don't you come back

620
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,254
No more, no more, no more

621
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,631
No more, no more, no more

622
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,474
Stick your chin up, man.

623
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,476
Higher.

624
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,105
-Christ.
-Goddamn.

625
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:22,781
Now, get your ass out on that street,
ladies, right this second!

626
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,785
I'll check you later, Swede. Yeah.

627
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,130
Sir, I'll wait outside for the MPs to come.

628
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:42,468
Negative, Johanson. You're gonna
become a Marine right now.

629
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:46,055
-Fall out.
-Yes, sir.

630
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,475
Good morning, men.

631
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,312
I thought I'd lead you
through this exercise.

632
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,024
Couldn't find Gunny Highway, though.

633
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,443
I don't know where he went.

634
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,128
Good Lord, what was that?

635
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:24,051
-Sir, that's an AK-47 assault weapon.
-The preferred weapon of our enemy.

636
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:28,013
It makes a very distinctive sound
when fired at us, sir.

637
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,808
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

638
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,852
-Good night, Aggie.
-Good night, Roy.

639
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,564
Hold up. I'll follow you home.

640
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,193
No, you go ahead. I've got some pains.

641
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:45,030
-Oh, I got it.
-Not tonight you don't.

642
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:57,251
"Sensual communication,
meaningful...."

643
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,378
Panther piss.

644
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:03,924
Glad to know some things don't change.
You still know what a woman loves to hear.

645
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:08,595
Oh, I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

646
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,223
I thought maybe you'd like to
sit down and talk.

647
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,101
Are you reading those magazines?

648
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,230
-What magazines?
-Those magazines.

649
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,277
Oh. Oh, those. No, I--
Somebody must have left them here.

650
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,821
-Who?
-Choozoo.

651
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,741
-He don't even know how to read.
-Quit being so stubborn.

652
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,617
Why don't you sit down
so we can talk?

653
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:34,246
I am not one of your troops
that can be bullied.

654
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,417
Jesus. Was being married
to me that bad?

655
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,044
Yes.

656
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,427
Platoon, ten-hut!

657
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:55,309
Thank you, gunny. What a fine morning
for a military exercise.

658
00:55:55,518 --> 00:56:01,231
Today we will execute an ambush against
a numerically superior hostile force...

659
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:06,862
...by using cover, surprise,
interlocking fields of fire...

660
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,698
...and the natural aggressiveness
of a U.S. Marine.

661
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,785
Show me some poontang,
I'll show you an aggressive Marine.

662
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,454
We will provide Powers
and his elite fighting force...

663
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,290
...an accessible target
to sharpen their superior skills.

664
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,668
This will be facilitated by
the MILES gear each team wears.

665
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,296
As you know,
when one of our men is shot...

666
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,507
...these laser-sensitive vests
emit a beeping noise.

667
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:32,471
Excuse me, lieutenant, but are you
hinting that we don't fight back?

668
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,392
Yes, gunny. The major likes to use
the Recon Platoon as a training tool.

669
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,895
What happens when these men go
into combat, and they're not prepared?

670
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,480
They just get dead.

671
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,525
Well, yes, I see what you mean.

672
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,985
Have you talked this over
with Major Powers?

673
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:56,203
-Let's move them out, gunny.
-Are you coming with us, lieutenant?

674
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,623
No, gunny, I have a doctor's
appointment at 1100.

675
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,001
I hope it's nothing that will keep you
out of the next war.

676
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,421
Platoon, right face.

677
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,425
Sling arms.

678
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,677
Forward march.

679
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,324
-You sure Highway can run the ambush?
-He's the best with small unit tactics.

680
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,993
I doubt that.

681
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:46,503
Marines, today we're gonna
kick some recon ass.

682
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,008
Platoon, ten-hut!

683
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,929
Right face. Forward march! Hut.

684
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:14,573
Man, when I joined the Corps, I thought
I was gonna be jumping out of planes...

685
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:18,368
-...and fighting the enemy.
-This is the new, modern Marines.

686
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,080
-We just jump out of our heads.
-Only enemy we fight is boredom.

687
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,666
You hear that voice? It's calling me.
Hollywood.

688
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,711
Stitch Jones is gonna be a rock 'n' roll star.

689
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,755
Don't forget your bros
when you make it.

690
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,383
Front row, center seat,
and all the girls I can't eat.

691
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,928
-Oh, I love leftovers.
-Mm-hm. Word.

692
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:40,182
-Unsling those rifles.
-What for? We're not supposed to win.

693
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,268
He watches too much prime time.

694
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,238
What was that?

695
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,449
You're dead, Marine.
You tripped on four booby traps.

696
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:01,286
Now we have to send out
a search party for your testicles.

697
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,830
Now, where the hell's your backup?

698
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,958
Profile.

699
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:09,920
What good are you back there?
Without cover, I get my ass blown off.

700
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:14,174
While you pump the neighbor's dog, we get
every swinging dick in this platoon killed.

701
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,260
That's what we're here for.

702
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,011
-What?
-We're here for that.

703
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,974
We've ambushed Powers three times,
always here. We know what we're doing.

704
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,686
Shit-for-brains, who says we're gonna
ambush Major Powers right here?

705
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,563
Didn't you hear Lt. Ring?

706
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:31,191
Major Powers wants us to die
in a loud, grotesque, military manner.

707
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,485
I don't give a fuck about Major Powers.

708
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:37,489
My job is to keep you men alive.
Now, let's move on.

709
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,791
We'll be coming to the ambush site
over the next hill.

710
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,543
Roger that.

711
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:53,171
It sure does help, knowing when
and where you're gonna be hit.

712
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:59,177
Easy. Give them a few more yards,
then we'll nail the coffin shut.

713
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,516
Chill out, here they come, man.

714
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,518
Hit them now!

715
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,479
Now.

716
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,908
Cease fire!

717
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,329
You're in the wrong ambush site!

718
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,749
Cease fire!

719
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,589
They're in the wrong ambush site!

720
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:39,051
Go, recon! Recon!

721
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,935
-Too bad, suckers!
-Sergeant major!

722
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,606
-What?
-Turn this damn thing off.

723
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,400
Makes a hell of a racket,
doesn't it, sir?

724
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:03,158
This man's usurped authority,
disregarded procedures...

725
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:07,746
...and ignored my personal directives
for over a week. Why, lieutenant?

726
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:12,084
-I thought the training--
-You're supposed to be an officer.

727
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:15,545
Look up that word in your
platoon leader's handbook.

728
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:20,092
Who gave you permission
to deviate from the training schedule?

729
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,469
I needed to evaluate my men, sir.

730
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,599
They're not your men, you arrogant son of
a bitch. They're the U.S. Marine Corps' men.

731
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,560
The 2nd Division's men.
The 8th Marines Regiment's.

732
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,605
In other words, they're my men,
and so are you. Get it?

733
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:39,027
The only thing I get is my ass shot off if
I have a platoon that doesn't know the job.

734
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,114
You'll follow my program,
no questions asked.

735
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:46,326
We go into combat tomorrow,
you'll plant half those men.

736
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,666
You did it on your own, didn't you?

737
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,044
I can't fix it if I don't know
what's broken.

738
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,796
Well, you make it easy.

739
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,214
Sir.

740
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,885
I gave the gunny permission
to freelance his-- I mean...

741
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,429
...the men, sir.

742
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,019
-Wait outside, Ring.
-Aye, aye, sir.

743
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,526
I'm gonna run you out of
the Corps, Highway.

744
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,821
And you know what's funny?
You're gonna do all the work.

745
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:28,493
Sooner or later, you'll disobey orders,
circumvent procedures again...

746
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,620
...or just get drunk.

747
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,458
You can't help it.
You're too old, too stupid...

748
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,127
...too prideful to change.

749
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,379
I'm gonna enjoy watching you fall.

750
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,425
Now, get out,
and send in that idiot, Ring.

751
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,351
He wants to see you, lieutenant.

752
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,190
-Sorry.
-No need to be.

753
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,025
Lieutenant?

754
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,943
Recon.

755
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,330
You'll let anybody in here, won't you?

756
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,583
Have one on the house
to ease your pain.

757
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,555
You wanna get drunk?

758
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,599
Howl at the moon?

759
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:37,062
Get us both busted back to low-ass,
no-rank, mud-rolling PFC?

760
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:38,814
I'm your man.

761
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,232
What are we, Chooz?

762
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:46,404
We're short-haired bastards with meat
cleavers for pricks and kerosene for blood.

763
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:49,825
Yeah. We're all of that,
that's for sure.

764
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,702
We're 0-1-1.

765
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,788
Say again?

766
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,708
Major Powers, one dark,
cloudy morning, said to me:

767
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:02,879
"Sergeant major, you're 0-1-1.

768
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,881
No wins.

769
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,259
One tie, Korea.

770
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,594
And one loss, Vietnam."

771
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:15,392
I mean, we lost the war,
but we won the battles.

772
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:21,439
I'm not gonna lose the next one
because my men aren't ready.

773
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,608
What are you gonna do?

774
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,485
Make them Marines.

775
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,363
Stoney Jackson.

776
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,074
Best goddamn platoon sergeant...

777
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:35,996
...two mewling, short-pricked, pissant
little fuckers ever went to war with.

778
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,165
-Yep. Heartbreak Ridge.
-Heartbreak Ridge.

779
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,293
Your C.O. called.

780
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,670
Your battalion just went on full alert.

781
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,183
God bless.

782
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:02,230
-I can't find my tent.
-Where's my poncho liner?

783
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,651
-Goddamn it! Who's got my web gear?
-Profile, that's my canteen.

784
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,446
Aponte better get his cartoon face
back here.

785
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,990
He's gonna do time for being AWOL.

786
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,535
People, let's have an equipment check.

787
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,120
Weapon?

788
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:24,127
Keep it simple. You've got your boots on.
You're gonna walk into combat. Let's go.

789
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,634
-Bullshit.
-Where's Aponte?

790
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:33,720
He's sick. Must be the beef.
I ain't feeling too good myself.

791
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,015
-You've eaten worse.
-Only when I'm shit-faced and silly.

792
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,892
Let's get going.

793
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:50,695
These DD 13-48 request forms
are not filled out properly.

794
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:54,324
We're going to approach this
in an orderly, proficient manner.

795
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:55,825
Yes, sir.

796
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:00,830
I want you to be sure each round of ammo
is counted and returned...

797
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,333
...in the same way it was received.

798
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:08,713
-I'll dot the I's and cross the T's.
-Sloppiness breeds inefficiency.

799
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,467
Your outfit could use some cleaning up,
gunny.

800
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,888
Sir, I want to issue my squad leader
some night vision glasses.

801
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:20,934
-I should've thought of that.
-It's not part of your T.O. & E.

802
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,185
I thought it--

803
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:26,022
Fill out the proper request forms
and send it through the chain of command.

804
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,983
Request forms?

805
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,571
Ten-hut.

806
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:37,909
At ease, men.

807
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,705
Major Malcolm Powers, sir.
Annapolis, class of 71.

808
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,250
How are your men doing, major?

809
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,170
My men are ready to fight to the death
to protect our country, sir.

810
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,383
Well, let's hope
that won't be necessary.

811
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,345
Have we ever served together?

812
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,848
I don't know, sir.
Sergeant Major Choozoo and I...

813
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:03,727
...were in the 2nd Battalion
of the 7th in '68.

814
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,980
I had a rifle company
in the 1st Battalion.

815
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,941
We sure as hell chewed
some of the same dirt, sir.

816
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,362
That's for sure.
What's your assessment of this alert?

817
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,781
It's a clusterfuck.

818
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:20,952
Say again?

819
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,330
Marines are fighting men.
They shouldn't be sitting around...

820
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,460
...filling out request forms for equipment
they should already have.

821
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,671
Interesting observation, gunny.

822
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,133
Carry on, major.

823
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,807
Now hear this. Now hear this.

824
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,101
This is it. We're going to war.

825
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:51,649
This has been an emergency
deployment readiness exercise.

826
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,860
We are standing down.

827
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,321
The alert is canceled.

828
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,156
Damn it.

829
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,493
-Maybe next time, sir.
-Gather your gear.

830
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,995
You heard him. We're moving out!

831
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,213
Hey!

832
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,048
Aponte.

833
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,301
-Oh, him.
-Where is he?

834
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,678
What's wrong with you?

835
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,932
Nobody goes over the hill on me.

836
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:28,394
If you didn't have those fucking stripes on,
I'd kick your fucking ass!

837
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:33,942
Since I'm not into violence,
I'll refrain from kicking your ass.

838
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,861
I'm gonna give you
a rebate on your life.

839
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,531
Besides, who the hell is Aponte?

840
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,492
He ain't heavy
and he ain't my brother.

841
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:47,664
-Gunny Highway.
-That's right. Gunny Highway.

842
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,374
Come on in.

843
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:53,878
-Sorry, Aponte, I had to tell him.
-Don't worry. This is my wife.

844
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,505
Clean that up.

845
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,508
Look, gunny, I filled out
all the forms there are.

846
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,594
But what the Corps gives you
isn't enough for the family.

847
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,430
-So I took a job.
-You got a job?

848
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,682
Yeah.

849
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,893
-Did you want out of the Marine Corps?
-No. No way.

850
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:12,689
Then I guess we'll have to
cut through all the red tape B.S.

851
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:15,441
-Yeah, we are.
-Knock it off, will you?

852
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:20,780
Here. Here's a special fund.
Gunnery sergeants only.

853
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,493
Don't worry. You can pay it back.

854
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:29,747
-Here, you better take him. Jesus Christ.
-Thank you.

855
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,633
-What are you smiling at, shit bird?
-I knew you were Santa Claus.

856
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,762
You ever pull another play like that,
the only thing that'll beat you to the brig...

857
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,098
...is the headlights
of the ambulance you're on.

858
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:50,018
Yes, sir, Gunnery Sergeant Highway, sir!

859
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:56,774
Hey, yo, you can't leave the duke of cool!

860
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,360
This man has no social graces.

861
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,200
So....

862
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:08,661
Lureen down at the Palace
said you had the night off.

863
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,955
Lureen talks too much.

864
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:13,750
Can I buy you a beer?

865
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,296
Jesus.

866
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,301
You come stomping back
into my life after all this time...

867
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,969
...with no warning whatsoever.

868
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:28,640
Interfere with me at my place of work,
damn near start a brawl.

869
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,643
Almost lost me the only
crummy job I could find.

870
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,978
Then you show up here,
expecting me to...

871
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:37,899
...just smooth as silk, invite you in
for a sit-down and a smile.

872
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:42,028
It's always the same, Highway.
All balls, no brains.

873
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:45,365
-Is there something you're afraid of?
-Yes.

874
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:50,203
I'm afraid I'll dent that thick skull
of yours with this frying pan here.

875
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:53,915
It wouldn't be the first time for that,
now would it?

876
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:55,959
No.

877
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,631
Nice place you have here.

878
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,385
Thanks. You want a glass?

879
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,512
Uh-uh.

880
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,731
Feet still bothersome?

881
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:22,777
Well, I hawk booze
five nights a week, you know?

882
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,697
There ain't no senior prom
looming on my horizon.

883
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,950
-To the old times.
-Mm.

884
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,869
Just as long as you don't say
"good times."

885
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,831
We had our share of those too,
didn't we?

886
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,792
I don't know. I can't think that far back.

887
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:40,128
How you feeling, babe?

888
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:44,132
Terrific. Absolutely couldn't feel better.

889
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,052
So...

890
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,138
...what brings you here?

891
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,808
I'm back with recon, back where I belong.

892
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,854
So?

893
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,189
It's different this time.

894
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,068
How?

895
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:07,405
I'm coming to the end of it.

896
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,825
I don't know where I go from here.
I just want it to end...

897
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,077
...as right as it was when I started.

898
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:17,957
You want some chips?

899
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,376
There's pretzels.

900
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,171
Yeah, thanks.

901
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,506
Fringe benefits of work.

902
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,634
Tell me something.

903
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,597
Did we mutually nurture each other?

904
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,224
I beg your pardon?

905
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:39,354
Did we communicate in a meaningful
way in our relationship?

906
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,439
Relationship?

907
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:43,608
Mm-hm.

908
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,071
Hell, I thought we were married.

909
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:52,367
Well, I've been thinking
about the past lately...

910
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,954
...and I was just wondering
what went wrong.

911
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,289
With what?

912
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,793
With me...

913
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,795
...the Corps, with us.

914
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,843
That is so damn much like you.

915
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:16,641
You never could see that everything just
doesn't fit so neatly into right and wrong.

916
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,810
What else is there?

917
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:22,146
It isn't that simple.

918
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:29,028
I went by those rooms we rented
when we were first married.

919
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,197
Damn, they're small.

920
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,411
Yeah, well, they say everything
shrinks with age.

921
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,916
Tell me something.

922
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,336
What did you want out of our marriage?

923
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:51,968
Well, we talked once
about an avocado ranch...

924
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:55,304
...about buying a house
with a barbecue in the back.

925
01:13:55,514 --> 01:14:00,685
But then you would volunteer for every
goddamn war that came down the pike.

926
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,731
Oh. Goddamn it!

927
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,776
-What's the matter?
-How could I be so stupid?

928
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,696
-What the hell are you talking about?
-You bastard.

929
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,907
-You changed tactics on me!
-What the fuck are you talking about?

930
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,869
Gave up the frontal assault,
tried to out-goddamn-flank me.

931
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:21,497
I am on to you.
I want you out of here right now!

932
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:25,585
Jesus Christ, you're not acting
very dignified for a mature woman.

933
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:31,883
Why, you old fucking Marine warhorse.
I'll show you dignified!

934
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:37,054
You get out of here! Get out of here!
Go on! Get the fuck out of here!

935
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:40,892
You better get your tail out of here
or I'll get mad!

936
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:43,102
Take that, you old fuck!

937
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:47,523
I never want to see your craggy
old face here again! You hear me?

938
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,985
Don't ever come back!
Ever, ever, ever! How dare you....

939
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:56,282
She's as crazy as she's always been,
for chrissake.

940
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,243
-You asshole!
-Shit.

941
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,746
Fuck.

942
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,915
Goddamn it.

943
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:06,751
I hate you, Highway!

944
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,046
Fuck you!

945
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:24,185
Tonight's winner is...

946
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,605
...Miss Sarita Dwayne!

947
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,899
-Oh!
-What a gal.

948
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:33,611
Hey, yo, wait a minute, man.
That's bullshit. No.

949
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:37,156
-You're trying to rip me the hell off.
-Nobody likes a sore loser.

950
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:42,286
I'm an equal opportunity ass-kicker.
We gonna take a little vote.

951
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:46,123
All you all that voted
for Miss Banana Titties, say, "Yeah."

952
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,500
-No.
-Boo.

953
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,461
All y'all that voted for me,
say, "Rock the house!"

954
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:54,423
-Rock the house!
-Rock the house!

955
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,969
-Say, "Rock the house!"
-Rock the house!

956
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:01,222
What's up?
You all the faggot Mod Squad?

957
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:04,559
I don't play none of this jail
give-up-the-booty bullshit.

958
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:06,394
Yeah, right.

959
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,985
Don't ask for my autograph.

960
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:21,158
Yeah, you can rob me.
You can starve me...

961
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:27,415
...and you can beat me, and you can
kill me. Just don't bore me.

962
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:36,340
-I'm glad I could help.
-I owe you dinner.

963
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,259
Sounds good.

964
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,053
Try not to make a habit of that.

965
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:43,431
Jesus Christ.

966
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:50,771
Powers will thin-slice your prick and pitch
your gonads if he finds out about this.

967
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:53,065
-Sergeant major!
-Who the hell are you?

968
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,401
Jones, sir. Second Battalion,
Recon Platoon.

969
01:16:57,237 --> 01:17:00,239
Christ, Highway's platoon.
Snap to, marine. Give me a hand.

970
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,200
-We're like brothers.
-Like my grandmother.

971
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,453
Yes, well, I posted his bail.

972
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:08,664
-He needs you, Aggie.
-Ha-ha. Until the next war.

973
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,916
Good thing we got him out.

974
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,461
Oh, shit.

975
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,671
Coffee.

976
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,471
Yeah, I always wanted
to check this place out.

977
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,809
-Look at all this history.
-Mary's served Marines from three wars.

978
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,187
How's he doing?

979
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:35,066
Aggie will put him back together again,
just like she always has.

980
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:37,193
Thank you, ma'am.

981
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,864
Highway's something else, huh?
High speed, low drag.

982
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,408
No one better to be with
if you're in a hot LZ.

983
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:46,661
Heartbreak Ridge.

984
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,538
It was the truth.

985
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,667
What's Heartbreak Ridge?

986
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:57,963
Now, listen. We have to understand
each other before...

987
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,424
...we go any further.

988
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,177
Are we going any further?

989
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:08,140
You're going to be out of the Corps soon.
But you're gung ho, through and through.

990
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,767
You always will be.

991
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:15,231
And there is no room
in my future for a...Marine.

992
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,943
I'm not sure I like
the way you say "Marine."

993
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:23,114
I can say Marine
any damn way I choose.

994
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:25,866
I earned that right.

995
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,787
That's right, you did.

996
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,790
I lived in a rat-hole when they
brought those boys home...

997
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,292
...in those flag-draped metal coffins.

998
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:41,048
I don't think I got a wink's sleep in '68.
Do you remember that year?

999
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:43,342
Yeah, I remember.

1000
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:48,097
I'd wake up in the morning and turn on
the TV. I'd eat dinner in front of it...

1001
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:51,934
...eyes glued, hoping to catch
a glimpse of you on the news...

1002
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:55,062
...and then praying that I wouldn't.

1003
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:59,316
And then I would crawl into bed and
I would wonder: Where were you?

1004
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:05,823
What were you doing? Were you alive?
And I had no way of knowing.

1005
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:16,208
I guess there's a lot of things that work
harder on a woman than being shot at.

1006
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:21,005
I swear, the not knowing was the worst.

1007
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:27,887
Oh, I'm sorry.

1008
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,107
That's all right, baby.

1009
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:46,280
That's all right.

1010
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,871
We went up and down that pile of dirt
for six days and six nights.

1011
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,290
Fixed bayonet, hand-to-hand.

1012
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,877
Fought them something fierce.
They gave back as good as they got.

1013
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:03,756
Lots of men died.
We were with the 23rd Infantry.

1014
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:08,219
We joined the Corps later. Hell,
we were even younger than you are.

1015
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:12,097
Hmm. I never heard of no Heartbreak Ridge.

1016
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:15,976
It ain't in any of the history books.
Just a little piece of war.

1017
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:18,771
Place didn't even have a name,
just a number.

1018
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,899
Stoney Jackson took one look
and said:

1019
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:24,944
"If this don't kill us,
it'll surely break our hearts."

1020
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,739
-Who's Stoney Jackson?
-Little Mary's husband.

1021
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,825
He was our platoon sergeant.

1022
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:35,204
He was the one who recommended Highway
for the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1023
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,624
Gunny Highway won the C.M.H.?

1024
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:44,004
He charged two machine gun nests by
himself. He didn't sleep for three days.

1025
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:48,217
The final human wave he held off
almost single-handedly.

1026
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,052
When it was over...

1027
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:55,099
...there was me, Stoney Jackson,
Tom Highway.

1028
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,561
We were the only ones still alive.

1029
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:01,647
What happened to Jackson?

1030
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,317
-He was killed at Khe Sanh in '68.
-Can I get you guys something to eat?

1031
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:07,361
I can fix it in no time.

1032
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,240
-No.
-Uh-- No, thank you, ma'am.

1033
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:17,329
Excuse me, ma'am.
You don't happen to be...

1034
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:20,332
...up and moving when
Gunny Highway leaves for the base?

1035
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,627
I pour his coffee and lay out his things.

1036
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:47,443
Platoon, ten-hut.

1037
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:50,571
Right face.

1038
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:53,741
Forward march!

1039
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:09,673
Each platoon will proceed to the objective,
which in this case is the Battalion Bear Pit.

1040
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:13,552
Whoever reaches it first
will get a 72-hour liberty.

1041
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:16,764
Sir. It'd be an honor
if you'd accompany my platoon.

1042
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:21,143
-Ugh.
-Thank you, staff sergeant.

1043
01:22:26,816 --> 01:22:28,442
Get out of your seats.

1044
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:57,346
-Johanson, tighten up that harness.
-Gunny, I'm afraid of heights.

1045
01:22:57,597 --> 01:23:00,015
-So am I.
-You are?

1046
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:03,644
Jumping out of a perfectly good aircraft
is not a natural act.

1047
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:07,147
So let's do it right
and enjoy the view. Come on.

1048
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,444
Let's move.

1049
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:57,448
We made it. We're the first platoon
to reach the Bear Pit.

1050
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:59,616
Not so quick, sir.

1051
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,413
Oh, darn. First Platoon.

1052
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,666
Major, it's Highway.

1053
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,209
Damn.

1054
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,379
Come on, men. Let's smoke them.

1055
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:14,465
First Platoon, follow me!

1056
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:39,239
Recon wins.

1057
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:43,994
Gunny, you don't know your place.
First Platoon is the victor.

1058
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,790
I'd say we have ourselves a dilemma, sir.

1059
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:52,628
Sergeant Major, I order you
to declare 1st Platoon the winner.

1060
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,923
Sir, that wouldn't be fair.

1061
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:59,009
What do you propose
to resolve this situation?

1062
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:00,427
Matchup.

1063
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:03,722
Okay, men, get them off.

1064
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:07,392
Get your shit off, let's go.

1065
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,604
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Come on!

1066
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,255
Come on!

1067
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:41,885
Come on, shithead!

1068
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,889
Get them out!

1069
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:53,105
Get them out!

1070
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,819
Come on, you fucking dickhead!

1071
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:03,740
-I got him! I got him! I got him!
-Pull!

1072
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,415
Come on!

1073
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:21,592
We've got him! First Platoon!

1074
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:29,099
Aah!

1075
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,101
Recon!

1076
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:34,229
Recon! Recon!

1077
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:39,276
Sergeant major, 1st Platoon wins!

1078
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,653
I don't see it that way, major.

1079
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,656
You're out of order.
First Platoon is king of the pit.

1080
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:47,492
-How do you figure?
-Your man cheated.

1081
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,204
-I say he improvised.
-He cheated!

1082
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:52,206
He adapted. He overcame.

1083
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:58,503
There's only one way to settle this.
Platoon sergeants, front and center.

1084
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,841
Remember, sergeant,
I'm leading your platoon today.

1085
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,804
Old man, it's time for somebody
to put you in your place.

1086
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:17,606
Come on, major!

1087
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,777
Let's go, gunny!

1088
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:26,049
Man, it felt great beating
Major Powers' elite fighting unit!

1089
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,554
I've been bitten
by every bug known to mankind.

1090
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:34,224
No, these bumps make you look
like you got muscles.

1091
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:37,894
-I bet I have poison ivy.
-Man, you can get permanent light duty...

1092
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:39,730
...for all the crud on your body.

1093
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:43,900
Your dream come true.
You won't have to do this bullshit no more.

1094
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:46,194
Fuck you.
I'm getting pretty good at this.

1095
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:48,280
Whoa!

1096
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,449
This man must be sick,
ladies and gentlemen.

1097
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,326
I'll tell you sick.

1098
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:57,289
Gunny Highway is the sickest individual
it's been my sorry pleasure to come across.

1099
01:28:57,498 --> 01:29:01,501
Order today and get this record
from Recon Records. Songs like:

1100
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:04,296
-"Highway, You Sick Individual."
-Yeah.

1101
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:07,966
-"Polish My Weapon, I'll Polish Yours."
-That's my song.

1102
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:11,887
-"Bionic, Bionic Marine."
-Bionic Marine.

1103
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,389
-That's it.
-Do that one.

1104
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:16,808
Well, he kicked a lot of ass

1105
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:19,102
At a place called Heartbreak Ridge

1106
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:23,315
Don't fuck with Scarface Highway
Baddest jarhead that there is

1107
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:27,444
He's a bad psycho mother
Bionic Marine

1108
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:31,448
A leatherneck lifer
Who likes the barracks clean

1109
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:34,993
-He kicked Powers in the ass
-Webster upside the head

1110
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:39,331
If you fuck with this sick mother
Then you gonna end up dead

1111
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:42,626
He's a fire-pissing jarhead
Bionic Marine

1112
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:46,380
Salty dog don't wear nothing
But Marine Corps green

1113
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:49,758
-Ain't got time to shit or shower
-Ain't got time to smoke a cig

1114
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:55,514
I said don't fuck with Gunny Highway
Or you'll end up in the brig

1115
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,227
Tell you something else, man.

1116
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,814
Highway won the Congressional
Medal of Honor at Heartbreak Ridge.

1117
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:05,857
-Check that out. Check that out!
-C.M.H.?

1118
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,319
I knew he was bad, but not that bad.

1119
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:13,240
Agent Powers wants statements
from each and every one of you.

1120
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,826
What kind of statements?

1121
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,204
Gunnery Sergeant Highway
used live ammunition...

1122
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:23,291
...with unauthorized weapons
on the training exercise.

1123
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,877
Says who?

1124
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:28,255
I thought you guys
didn't like Highway.

1125
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:33,218
I heard that AK-47 fire
coming from your A.O.

1126
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:39,724
Don't you boys want to go back to the
way it was? Nobody fucking with you?

1127
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:46,606
It seems to me that no one's gonna
fuck with us the way things are now.

1128
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:49,985
There's weekend liberty
in it for all of you.

1129
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:52,446
I'll start with you.

1130
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:54,614
I got nothing to say.

1131
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:56,950
You.

1132
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:03,081
This is gonna go hard on y'all
if y'all don't cooperate.

1133
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:08,628
We ain't got nothing to say to you,
Webster.

1134
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:14,009
Why don't you take your ass back
to that faggot 1st Platoon of yours...

1135
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:18,138
...and don't go away mad, just go away.

1136
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,183
You've been told.

1137
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,647
Bye, Webster.

1138
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:32,694
Yeah!

1139
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:38,992
-I hate social functions.
-You're gonna love it.

1140
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:42,120
Your presence is requested at
the M.A.U. commander's open house.

1141
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,497
Full military dress.

1142
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:47,751
-Piss on that.
-You will be there, Sergeant Highway.

1143
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:53,507
Stand tall and look sharp so they can
see a hero who isn't bleeding to death.

1144
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:56,718
-Let's find the bar.
-Good idea.

1145
01:31:58,804 --> 01:32:02,224
-How are you this evening? Thanks.
-How are you?

1146
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:04,935
Privileged to greet
a Medal of Honor winner.

1147
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:06,937
Thank you, sir.

1148
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,981
Run into any clusterfucks lately?

1149
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,194
No. Not lately, sir.

1150
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,822
Thank you for stopping by.
Enjoy the party.

1151
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:24,496
I love watching the brass snap to
attention when they see that ribbon.

1152
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:27,165
What do you do at a party like this?
Stick out your pinkie?

1153
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:30,001
Just don't unzip
and stick Old Blue out.

1154
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:34,130
Didn't J.J. Johnson do that
at a WAVE party in San Diego?

1155
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:39,094
No, that was me. J.J. mooned
the ARVN general at China Beach.

1156
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:44,474
Here, let's drink a toast to J.J.
and all the pieces of him we couldn't find.

1157
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:47,143
Funniest guy I ever met.

1158
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:52,023
One thing about a party like this,
the conversation's so adult.

1159
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:58,613
I think I'm gonna head for
the back door of this place.

1160
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,365
And lose all this joy?

1161
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:03,451
You won't be brokenhearted if I cut in,
will you?

1162
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:07,998
I'll get over it.
I'm gonna see what the chow's like.

1163
01:33:08,165 --> 01:33:10,500
Would you like to dance?

1164
01:33:11,043 --> 01:33:14,254
-Yeah. What are you doing here?
-I'm still on the mailing list.

1165
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,006
Hmm.

1166
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,341
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1167
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:39,571
Did I by any chance
give you that perfume?

1168
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:43,867
What's so funny?

1169
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:45,285
I was just thinking...

1170
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:49,623
...this reminds me of the senior prom
and that chaperone with the ruler.

1171
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:53,209
"Agnes Anne, you keep 8 inches
of daylight...

1172
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:56,004
...between you and that young man
you're dancing with."

1173
01:33:57,381 --> 01:34:00,842
Yeah, I do remember that.
Wasn't that the...?

1174
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,053
The first night we ever...?

1175
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:05,889
Yes. Yes, it was.

1176
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:10,268
Agnes Anne, you were a wild creature,
I must say.

1177
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:14,648
What do your magazines say about that?

1178
01:34:14,857 --> 01:34:16,983
I don't know, I haven't gotten to that part.

1179
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:20,070
-Are you still reading them?
-Affirmative.

1180
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:23,323
And what do they say about ex-wives?

1181
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:27,952
Not too much.
Just that the sex is great...

1182
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:32,791
...because you don't have to establish
a relationship or be meaningful.

1183
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:39,422
-You really are trying to understand us?
-The best I can, yeah.

1184
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:44,636
Is that because you can't be a Marine
anymore and you've got no place to go?

1185
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:48,223
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

1186
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:52,143
It's all right. We've known each other
too long to run away...

1187
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:55,438
...just over a little thing like
tearing each other's guts out.

1188
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:59,818
Tom, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that. It just--

1189
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:03,321
It just never seems to work out
between you and me.

1190
01:35:05,741 --> 01:35:07,617
-With her husband.
-I see.

1191
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:10,954
-I'm having a great time.
-It's a whole family gathering.

1192
01:35:12,748 --> 01:35:16,960
I've been thinking a little bit about
that avocado ranch we talked about.

1193
01:35:17,169 --> 01:35:20,755
Tom, Roy has asked me to marry him.

1194
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:23,216
What did you say?

1195
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:27,721
Your attention, please.

1196
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:32,350
The 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit's
alert status has just been upgraded.

1197
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:37,397
All officers and staff NCOs will
immediately return to their units.

1198
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,023
Thank you.

1199
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:28,698
What's the deal?
Is this another bullshit alert?

1200
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:30,658
We're going to war, men.

1201
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,535
Mother of Jesus.

1202
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:35,663
We're gonna assist in an operation
on the island of Grenada...

1203
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:37,624
...to rescue American citizens there.

1204
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:39,417
The island of what?

1205
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:42,879
Grenada, a Caribbean island
also known as the Isle of Spice.

1206
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:45,548
It's 86 nautical miles
northeast of Venezuela.

1207
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:49,302
Our mission is to helocast into a small
bay on the west side of the island...

1208
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,513
...and recon in advance of the Marines.

1209
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,891
I can't do that, man.
I forgot my suntan oil.

1210
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:57,727
Come on, it's time to earn your pay.
Let's move it.

1211
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,896
Pick it up. Let's go.

1212
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:12,784
Now hear this. Now hear this.

1213
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:17,288
Flight deck, prepare to launch helo.
Prepare to launch helo.

1214
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:53,843
Over there!

1215
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,777
Your glasses.

1216
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:13,655
Get ready.

1217
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:48,982
Choozoo, do you read me?

1218
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:52,860
This is Highway. Do you read me?

1219
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:56,072
I want your platoon to recon
toward the university.

1220
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,533
Stay low around Powers, you hear?

1221
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,871
See you when it's over.

1222
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,607
Spread out. Spread out.

1223
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:37,238
Jesus, what was that?

1224
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:42,201
-AK-47. It has a distinctive sound.
-Proceed swiftly and with caution.

1225
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:45,163
Get that 60 going around the corner.

1226
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,803
Cover my ass.

1227
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:17,028
Highway's crazy, man.

1228
01:41:41,303 --> 01:41:43,304
They pulled out, lieutenant!

1229
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:45,515
All right, Aponte.

1230
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,350
Slowly.

1231
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:55,358
Damn.

1232
01:42:24,888 --> 01:42:26,472
Cubans. Mm.

1233
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:29,642
Three-man recon team.

1234
01:42:30,602 --> 01:42:34,147
Better spread out. I'm sure
they got buddies around here.

1235
01:42:34,773 --> 01:42:36,357
Let's go.

1236
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:39,944
Spread the fuck out. Let's go.

1237
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,601
Okay. Go ahead.

1238
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:33,122
We forgot the hot dogs. I'll go back
to New York and get the hamburgers.

1239
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:35,291
Are you as good with engines
as your mouth?

1240
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:38,211
-Jones is the name, hot-wire's the game.
-Get on that cat.

1241
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:40,046
Get on that cat with him.

1242
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:50,223
-You set? Let's do it.
-Let's go.

1243
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,433
Swede. Get up there with that M-60.

1244
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:17,708
Yeah!

1245
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:34,308
I'm the ayatollah of rock 'n' roll-ah!

1246
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:40,773
Stay right there, sucker.

1247
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,365
Whoo!

1248
01:45:23,108 --> 01:45:24,275
Stay low.

1249
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:16,494
Jesus, please forgive me.

1250
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:24,710
Come on, let's go.

1251
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:47,566
Let them know who you are
so no friendlies get hurt.

1252
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:51,070
Hello, happening hostages,
I'm Stitch Jones, Mr. Funkadelic.

1253
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:53,989
Try U.S. Marine, shithead.

1254
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,931
It's all clear!

1255
01:47:34,364 --> 01:47:36,866
United States Marines!

1256
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:42,538
Ah!

1257
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,213
You've improved.

1258
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:54,508
Goddamn it, gunny!

1259
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:11,942
Uh-- U.S. Marines, ma'am.

1260
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:21,118
-U.S. Marines!
-Everybody all right?

1261
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:32,546
You know what they say:
A behind is a terrible thing to waste.

1262
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:36,592
Delta Company said they'd give us
surfboards and let us go down to the beach.

1263
01:48:36,801 --> 01:48:40,554
One of those students kissed me
four times. I think I'm in love.

1264
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:43,307
-Was he good-looking?
-It was a girl.

1265
01:48:43,517 --> 01:48:46,477
Clean your weapons,
check your ammo.

1266
01:48:48,146 --> 01:48:51,106
All secured. No casualties,
no sign of enemy.

1267
01:48:51,274 --> 01:48:54,610
Very good. I want some pictures
before we wrap this mission.

1268
01:48:54,819 --> 01:48:57,905
We encountered heavy resistance
along the way.

1269
01:48:58,114 --> 01:48:59,406
Probably local fanatics.

1270
01:48:59,616 --> 01:49:02,701
Negative. Cuban regulars
with Russian rifles.

1271
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:05,955
That type of data
has already been factored in.

1272
01:49:06,122 --> 01:49:08,290
-Battalion.
-Go ahead.

1273
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:13,879
Big Daddy says to get off your fat ass
and get back in the war. His words, sir.

1274
01:49:14,839 --> 01:49:16,465
Says to recon that hill.

1275
01:49:16,633 --> 01:49:19,009
Some flier thinks he saw some armor.

1276
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:23,138
-You're full of good news.
-You're too ugly to live forever.

1277
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:28,644
Gunny, recon that hill, but wait for Foxtrot
Company before launching any assault.

1278
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,896
Now, you stay in contact.

1279
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:34,692
Shall I send back data, sir,
or is that already factored in?

1280
01:49:35,026 --> 01:49:36,694
Move out.

1281
01:49:38,154 --> 01:49:41,907
Powers has the hots for you. Watch
your back. Could be wedding bells.

1282
01:49:42,117 --> 01:49:45,160
All right, let's move out, recon.
Form up.

1283
01:49:47,497 --> 01:49:49,331
All right, let's go.

1284
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:01,468
Come on.

1285
01:50:01,886 --> 01:50:03,596
Keep moving.

1286
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:07,641
Careful, guys.

1287
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,064
Shit!

1288
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:19,028
-Let's move!
-Get down. Get down!

1289
01:50:19,195 --> 01:50:20,529
Get in the building!

1290
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:21,989
No!

1291
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:37,087
Move it!

1292
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:03,739
Get in the building! Go!

1293
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:29,682
Bad mistake, coming in here like this.

1294
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:33,143
-It's my fault.
-Apologize to their mothers.

1295
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:34,770
Jesus, gunny!

1296
01:51:36,356 --> 01:51:38,482
Lay some steel on those targets.

1297
01:51:39,442 --> 01:51:41,276
Collins, Aponte!

1298
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:45,280
Radio battalion, see if we can
get some air support.

1299
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,616
Yo, gunny, I think Profile's dead.

1300
01:52:02,006 --> 01:52:04,466
Don't let him die, gunny.

1301
01:52:05,427 --> 01:52:07,511
That's not up to me.

1302
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:10,639
Come on, stay down, everyone.
Let's go.

1303
01:52:16,312 --> 01:52:18,313
-How you doing?
-I'm okay.

1304
01:52:18,523 --> 01:52:22,484
-Doing better than Profile.
-I can still fight.

1305
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:25,237
-We gonna make it out?
-Why, got a date?

1306
01:52:25,447 --> 01:52:26,655
You never know.

1307
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,952
Gunny, I got Profile killed.

1308
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:35,831
It was his time. When it's your time,
I don't give a damn how fast you run.

1309
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,959
-I could've gotten them all killed.
-But you didn't.

1310
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:41,128
Just don't make the same mistake twice.

1311
01:52:41,337 --> 01:52:42,504
Right.

1312
01:52:42,672 --> 01:52:47,634
I think I figured out a way to call in an air
strike if we can find where this line's cut.

1313
01:52:47,844 --> 01:52:49,511
Jones!

1314
01:52:49,804 --> 01:52:52,681
-That's the name, loving's the game.
-Thanks for volunteering.

1315
01:52:53,683 --> 01:52:57,436
-Say what?
-Get up and find where the line's cut.

1316
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:00,939
Come on, don't stand there, damn it.

1317
01:53:13,495 --> 01:53:16,747
I wish I was back in New Jersey,
watching The Flintstones.

1318
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:17,998
I hate this bullshit.

1319
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:29,134
Do you know who you're shooting at?
I'm the ayatollah of rock 'n' roll-ah.

1320
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:33,889
Probably don't speak no English.
Banana-eating, bean-farting motherfuckers.

1321
01:53:34,557 --> 01:53:37,267
Hello? Hello?

1322
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:40,854
-It works!
-Damn right, it works.

1323
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:43,524
Almost got my ass shot off for Ma Bell.

1324
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:45,734
Hello? Operator?

1325
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:49,446
I'd like to make an emergency
long-distance call...

1326
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:52,741
...to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

1327
01:53:52,909 --> 01:53:54,284
Collect.

1328
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:56,245
What?

1329
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:00,582
Anybody got a credit card?
They won't make collect calls.

1330
01:54:04,754 --> 01:54:09,174
Have no fear, Stitch is here.
I never go to combat without my plastic.

1331
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:13,637
Yes.

1332
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:16,348
It's 6-6-0...

1333
01:54:16,724 --> 01:54:18,559
...5-5-8...

1334
01:54:18,768 --> 01:54:20,602
...0-7-1-1.

1335
01:54:21,813 --> 01:54:23,605
Camp Lejeune.

1336
01:54:24,566 --> 01:54:26,275
Are you for real?

1337
01:54:27,569 --> 01:54:31,321
Grid 2-1-9...

1338
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:37,452
...6-3-2-1-8--

1339
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:42,207
-Did they get it?
-I don't know. The phone went dead.

1340
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:44,960
Give me that.

1341
01:54:47,171 --> 01:54:48,964
Gunny, where are you going?

1342
01:54:49,132 --> 01:54:51,508
They don't see our marker,
we're in real trouble.

1343
01:54:51,676 --> 01:54:53,802
You don't know
if the transmission got through.

1344
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:56,972
Well, I'll have to improvise, sir.

1345
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,057
Shit.

1346
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:16,658
Shit, Highway's been hit!

1347
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:25,208
What are we gonna do, sir?

1348
01:55:29,631 --> 01:55:31,173
Let's go.

1349
01:56:03,873 --> 01:56:05,415
Don't die, man.

1350
01:56:08,795 --> 01:56:10,379
Gunny!

1351
01:56:12,256 --> 01:56:13,924
Jones....

1352
01:56:14,926 --> 01:56:16,551
Just because we're holding hands...

1353
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:20,263
...doesn't mean we're gonna take warm
showers till the wee hours of the morning.

1354
01:56:20,431 --> 01:56:22,224
You hear me?

1355
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:26,061
-Sucker, I thought you was dead!
-Wishful thinking.

1356
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:34,111
Well, lieutenant,
what are we waiting for?

1357
01:56:34,487 --> 01:56:36,405
All right, you devil dogs.

1358
01:56:36,614 --> 01:56:39,992
-Let's take this fucking hill!
-Oorah!

1359
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:44,997
-Let's go!
-Go, go!

1360
01:58:58,047 --> 01:58:59,881
Go!

1361
01:59:10,226 --> 01:59:11,893
All right, get them out of there!

1362
01:59:14,605 --> 01:59:16,606
Put your hands up!

1363
01:59:36,377 --> 01:59:38,837
-Bunker secure, sir!
-Thank you.

1364
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:41,882
-Corporal Jones!
-Yes, sir.

1365
01:59:43,092 --> 01:59:45,635
-Move them out.
-You heard the man! Move out!

1366
01:59:54,854 --> 01:59:56,855
Move it, ladies!

1367
02:00:27,762 --> 02:00:30,639
Just what the hell
do you think you were doing?

1368
02:00:34,977 --> 02:00:37,145
Just enjoying the view, sir.

1369
02:00:38,689 --> 02:00:40,732
Well, you disobeyed a direct order.

1370
02:00:42,151 --> 02:00:46,154
I told you to stay in contact
and not to take this hill without me.

1371
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:49,741
Get on your feet, Highway!

1372
02:00:51,994 --> 02:00:56,164
Will all due respect, sir, you're beginning
to bore the hell out of me.

1373
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:36,538
-Who's in charge here?
-I am, sir. Major Malcolm Powers.

1374
02:01:36,747 --> 02:01:38,873
Did you lead this assault?

1375
02:01:39,417 --> 02:01:43,670
Lieutenant Ring and Gunnery Sergeant
Highway disobeyed a direct order.

1376
02:01:43,879 --> 02:01:47,340
I told them to wait for support,
but they still charged up this hill.

1377
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:48,758
Why?

1378
02:01:48,968 --> 02:01:51,803
We're paid to improvise, sir.
Overcome, adapt.

1379
02:01:52,054 --> 02:01:53,888
I gave the order to take this hill.

1380
02:01:54,056 --> 02:01:56,474
Ring, this is gonna ruin your career.

1381
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:01,771
-Are you new to the infantry, major?
-Yes, sir. Come over from Supply.

1382
02:02:01,981 --> 02:02:03,982
-Were you good at that?
-Yes, sir.

1383
02:02:04,191 --> 02:02:08,320
Then stick to it. You're a walking
clusterfuck as an infantry officer.

1384
02:02:08,529 --> 02:02:10,572
This is a Marine amphibious unit.

1385
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:12,282
My men are hard-chargers.

1386
02:02:12,491 --> 02:02:15,243
Ring and Highway took
a handful of young fire-pissers...

1387
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:18,496
...exercised some personal initiative,
and kicked ass!

1388
02:02:20,374 --> 02:02:22,751
-Good work, lieutenant.
-Thank you, sir.

1389
02:02:22,918 --> 02:02:25,628
See that some of those students
are escorted back to Cherry Point.

1390
02:02:25,963 --> 02:02:27,088
Aye, aye, sir.

1391
02:02:29,008 --> 02:02:30,967
Well, you're dismissed.

1392
02:02:51,155 --> 02:02:56,284
What the hell are you two sorry-assed
individuals looking at? Get out of my LZ.

1393
02:02:57,703 --> 02:02:59,120
Semper Fi.

1394
02:03:00,122 --> 02:03:01,790
Oorah.

1395
02:03:04,126 --> 02:03:08,296
Well, Chooz, I guess we're not
0-1-1 now, huh?

1396
02:03:47,336 --> 02:03:49,963
-There's my family.
-All right!

1397
02:03:50,172 --> 02:03:53,299
-Got anybody here?
-No, but it's a beautiful day...

1398
02:03:53,509 --> 02:03:56,469
-...and your boy Stitch is ready to play.
-Give them hell.

1399
02:03:56,679 --> 02:03:59,347
Yeah, I'm gonna do that. Definitely.

1400
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:16,114
Like I said, it's a beautiful day and
Stitch Jones is ready to play, you know?

1401
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:18,450
-Anytime, man.
-All right, big guy.

1402
02:04:18,659 --> 02:04:22,787
You'll be a civilian soon.
You can let your hair long, sleep late...

1403
02:04:22,997 --> 02:04:25,331
...and become an asshole
rock 'n' roll star.

1404
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:28,543
Sergeant Major Choozoo
gave me re-up papers.

1405
02:04:28,752 --> 02:04:30,253
And you signed them?

1406
02:04:30,421 --> 02:04:33,798
Tell you the truth, gunny,
I'm a better Marine than a singer.

1407
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:36,468
You're also a lot dumber
than I thought you were.

1408
02:04:36,635 --> 02:04:38,344
What about you?

1409
02:04:39,013 --> 02:04:43,391
No, I've had it. No room
in this man's Corps for me now.

1410
02:04:43,559 --> 02:04:45,935
Besides, they've got you.

1411
02:04:54,403 --> 02:04:55,904
Michael!

1412
02:04:59,575 --> 02:05:01,367
Hi, honey!

1413
02:05:01,744 --> 02:05:03,077
He-hey!

1414
02:05:07,082 --> 02:05:11,586
I guess all this marching bands and
parades and shit is old stuff to you?

1415
02:05:11,795 --> 02:05:14,130
Tell you the truth, this is the first time.

1416
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:17,592
Well, well, well. There are my ladies.

1417
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,219
Well, hey, gunny...

1418
02:05:19,428 --> 02:05:21,054
...duty calls.

1419
02:05:23,766 --> 02:05:25,266
What's happening?
