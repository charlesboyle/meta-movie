1
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,139
I think its our tradition...

2
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:03,979
It comes out of a...

3
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,299
...particularly painful
part of our history.

4
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:07,459
Yes. Yes.

5
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:09,539
But it's been a way
we've been able to heal.

6
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,819
At first it was a
reminder of the rebellion

7
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,299
It was the price the
Districts had to pay.

8
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,339
But I think it has grown from that.

9
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,419
I think its a...

10
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,459
Its something that
nets us all together.

11
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,619
This is your third year's game?

12
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,939
What defines your personal signature?

13
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,579
Shhhh. It's okay.

14
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,339
It's okay.
You're just dreaming.

15
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:41,619
You're dreaming.

16
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,619
I know.

17
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,899
I know what its like.

18
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:51,459
It's your first...
Prim, your name's gonna

19
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,219
be there once, they're
not gonna pick you!

20
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,259
Try to go to sleep.

21
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,819
I can't.

22
00:01:58,499 --> 00:01:59,739
Just try.

23
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,419
Just try.

24
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,699
Deep in the meadow.

25
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,219
Under the willow.

26
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,099
Hop in the grass.

27
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:29,339
A soft green and pillow.

28
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,659
You remember that song?

29
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,259
Ok.

30
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,339
You finish it.

31
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,259
I gotta go.

32
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,539
Where?

33
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:39,579
I just gotta go.

34
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,099
But I'll be back.

35
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,419
I love you.

36
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,259
I'll still cook you.

37
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:04,899
What're you gonna do with
that when you kill it?

38
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,019
Damn you, Gale!

39
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:10,699
It's not funny.

40
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:13,379
What're you gonna do with
a 100 pound deer, Katnip?

41
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,099
It's Reaping Day, the place is
crawling with Peacekeepers.

42
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,459
I was gonna sell it.

43
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:19,299
From kisskeepers..

44
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:20,499
Of course you were.

45
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:22,019
Like you don't sell the Peacekeepers.

46
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:23,459
No! Not today.

47
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,579
It's the first deer
I've seen in a year.

48
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,459
Now, I have nothing.

49
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,699
Okay.

50
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,499
What if they did? Just one you.
Why if everyone just stop watching?

51
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,339
They won't, Gale.

52
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,619
What if they did? What if we did?

53
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:24,899
Won't happen.

54
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,899
You root for your favorite, you cry
when they get killed. It's sick.

55
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:28,699
Gale.

56
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:29,859
If no one watches...

57
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,299
Then they don't have a game.
It's as simple as that.

58
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,219
What?

59
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,499
Nothing.

60
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:36,299
Fine, laught at...

61
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:37,539
I'm not laughing at you.

62
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,499
We could do it, you know?

63
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,699
Take off. Live in the woods.
What we do anyway?

64
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:51,579
They'd catch us.

65
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,819
Maybe not.

66
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,539
Cut out our tongues or worse.

67
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,419
We wouldn't make it five miles.

68
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,659
No, I get five miles.

69
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:00,819
We'll go that way.

70
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,979
I have Prim. You have your brothers.

71
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:04,099
They can come too.

72
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,339
Prim in the woods?

73
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,459
Maybe not.

74
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,739
I'm never having kids.

75
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:14,579
Not might.

76
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:15,659
If I don't live here.

77
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:16,699
But you do live here.

78
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,939
I know, but if I didn't.

79
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:22,499
Oh, I forgot.

80
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,339
Here.

81
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,579
Oh my God!

82
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:27,179
Is this real?

83
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,339
Yeah. Better be.

84
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,699
Cost me a squirrel.

85
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,499
Happy Hunger Games.

86
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,619
And be the odds be
ever in your favor.

87
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,619
How many times did
your name in today?

88
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,059
Forty-two?

89
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,019
I guess the odds aren't
exactly in my favor.

90
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:16,378
Thank you girl.

91
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:26,298
What's this?

92
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:28,618
That's a... Mocking Jay.

93
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:32,378
How much?

94
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,418
You keep it.

95
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,698
It's yours.

96
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:37,978
Thank you.

97
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:51,098
Mom?

98
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:54,818
Aww. Look at you.

99
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,138
You look beautiful.

100
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,618
Let's better tuck in
that tail by the back.

101
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:01,338
Made something out for you two.

102
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:05,378
Okay.

103
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:31,778
How you look beautiful too.

104
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:33,418
We should oughta pick you.

105
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:35,658
Oh no.

106
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:37,898
Here's how it will
pick you in the back.

107
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:44,938
Breathe.

108
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:46,498
Wanna see what I got you today?

109
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:50,778
It's a Mocking Jay pin.

110
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:52,658
To protect you.

111
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,298
And as long as you have it.

112
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,498
Nothing bad will happen to you.

113
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:59,218
Okay?

114
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:00,498
I promise.

115
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,298
Shh.

116
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:59,978
Shh. Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh.

117
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,658
Okay, it's time to send her now.

118
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:04,218
Okay, they will prick your finger
to take just a little bit of blood.

119
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:05,058
I'm scared.

120
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:06,938
Prim, it doesn't hurt
much. Just a little.

121
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:08,218
Okay?

122
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,498
Go sit down there
with the little kids.

123
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,818
I'll find you after okay?

124
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:12,418
Next.

125
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:14,418
Next.

126
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:26,978
Go ahead.

127
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,218
Next.

128
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,058
Next.

129
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:42,098
Next.

130
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,818
Next.

131
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,218
Welcome.

132
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:25,098
Welcome. Welcome.

133
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:27,618
Happy Hunger Games.

134
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:29,058
And...

135
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:32,498
May the odds be ever in your favor.

136
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:35,738
Now, before we begin.

137
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,938
We have a very special film.

138
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:41,738
Brought to you all the
way from the Capitol.

139
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,138
War.

140
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,178
Terrible war.

141
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,298
With those...

142
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:55,738
Orphan... and motherless child.

143
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:59,178
This was the uprising
that brought our land.

144
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:03,338
13 Districts rebel against
the country that fed them.

145
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,058
Protected them.

146
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:12,018
Then came the peace.

147
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:13,298
Hard fought.

148
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:14,298
Solely won.

149
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:15,258
The people.

150
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:19,018
Rose up from the ashes
and a new era was born.

151
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:21,858
The freedom has a cost.

152
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,658
And the traitors was defeated.

153
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:25,498
Peace-War as a nation.

154
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:28,418
We would never know
this treason again.

155
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,538
And so, it was decreed...

156
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:31,778
That each year.

157
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,458
The various districts of Panem
would offer up in tribute...

158
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,098
One young man and woman.

159
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,698
To fight to the death.

160
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,658
And it peg you to honor,
courage and sacrifice.

161
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,018
The lone victor...

162
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,298
Bathe in riches...

163
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:48,778
Will serve as our reminder
of our generosity.

164
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:50,138
.. and our forgiveness.

165
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:52,938
This is how we remember our past.

166
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,938
This is how we safe guard our future.

167
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:58,778
I just love that.

168
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:04,098
Now, the time has come to...

169
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:05,338
...select...

170
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:09,458
...one courageous
young man and woman.

171
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:13,778
For the honor of
representing District

172
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:17,218
12 in the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.

173
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:19,818
As usual...

174
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:21,898
...ladies first.

175
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,778
Primrose Everdeen!

176
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,138
Where are you?

177
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:00,618
Come on up.

178
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:02,898
Well, come on up!

179
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,697
Prim!

180
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,097
Prim!

181
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:29,537
No!

182
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,817
I volunteer!

183
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:34,817
I volunteer as Tribute.

184
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,937
I believe we have a volunteer.

185
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:43,137
- You need to get out of here.
- No!

186
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:44,217
- Go find mom!
- No!

187
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,497
- Prim, go find mom!
- No!

188
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:46,337
I'm so sorry!

189
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:47,217
No!

190
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:48,497
Noo!

191
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:51,617
Noo! Nooo! Noooo!

192
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:55,857
In mad of turn of events
here on District 12.

193
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:03,097
District 12's very first volunteer.
Big breath.

194
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,657
Come on dear.

195
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:20,337
What's your name?

196
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:22,017
Katniss Everdeen.

197
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:25,017
Well, I bet my hat
that was your sister.

198
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,297
Wasn't it?

199
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,257
Yes.

200
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:34,457
Let's have a big hand for our very
first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.

201
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:48,977
And now...

202
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:50,657
...for the boys.

203
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,417
Peeta Mellark.

204
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:27,457
Here we are.

205
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:31,457
Our Tributes from District 12.

206
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:34,537
Well, go on you two. Shake hands.

207
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:49,417
Happy Hunger Games.

208
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:53,657
And be the odds be
ever in your favor.

209
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,217
You have 3 minutes.

210
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,137
Prim, Prim, its okay.

211
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:18,177
Shh. Prim, I don't have much time.

212
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,737
Prim, listen.

213
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:21,817
You're gonna be okay.

214
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,257
Don't take any extra food for money.

215
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:25,457
That doesn't worth putting
your name in more times, okay?

216
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:26,737
Listen, Prim.

217
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:29,297
Gale will bring you game.
He stuck cheese from your coat.

218
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:32,417
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

219
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:36,817
Maybe I can, I am smart you know?

220
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:38,617
You can hunt.

221
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:40,137
Exactly.

222
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,697
It's to protect you.

223
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:54,777
Thank you.

224
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:09,577
You can't turn out again.

225
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:11,457
I won't

226
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:12,857
No, you can't.

227
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:14,137
Not like when dad died.

228
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:16,017
I won't be here anymore.
Your all she has.

229
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:19,097
No matter what you feel, you will
be there for her. You understand?

230
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:21,897
Don't cry.

231
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,337
Don't cry. Don't.

232
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:30,857
It's time.

233
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,977
It's okay. Prim, it's okay.

234
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:35,057
No! No!

235
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:37,217
I promise Prim.

236
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,017
I'm fine.

237
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,017
You don't know.

238
00:19:57,017 --> 00:19:58,257
I am.

239
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,217
Listen to me.

240
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:02,777
You're stronger than they are.
You are.

241
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:06,137
Get to a bow. What will if you
show them how good you are?

242
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,577
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

243
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:10,417
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one.

244
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,737
Okay? You know how to hunt.

245
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:13,737
They're not animals.

246
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:16,857
It's no different Katniss.

247
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:21,217
There's 24 of us Gale
and only one comes out.

248
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:22,857
Yeah.

249
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:24,217
And it's gonna be you.

250
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:25,577
Okay.

251
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:26,817
Take care of them Gale.

252
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,057
Whatever you do, don't
let them starve.

253
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:28,857
Let's go!

254
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:30,337
I'll see you soon okay?

255
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,337
You two haven't had trip?

256
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:36,017
Crystal chandeliers.

257
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:37,377
Platinum donuts.

258
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:42,417
200 miles per hour and you
can barely feel a thing.

259
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,977
I think its rather a wonderful
thing is about this opportunity...

260
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:48,657
That even though you're here and even
though it's just for a little while.

261
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:51,937
You get to enjoy all of this.

262
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:57,457
I'm going to find Haymitch.

263
00:21:57,497 --> 00:21:59,977
He's probably in the back car.

264
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:12,857
You even met him?

265
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:17,377
Haymitch?

266
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:23,657
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.

267
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,217
He did witness things once.

268
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:33,937
Look!

269
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,856
You know if you don't want to talk,
I understand. But I just don't

270
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,736
think there's anything wrong of
getting a little bit of help.

271
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:04,696
Congratulations.

272
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:25,136
Where's the ice?

273
00:23:27,696 --> 00:23:29,256
I don't... I don't know.

274
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:42,696
Okay, so uh...

275
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,056
...so when do we start?

276
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:45,896
Whoah.

277
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,496
Why so eager?

278
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:51,096
Most of you are in such a hurry.

279
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:52,736
Yeah.
I wanna know what the plan is.

280
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:53,896
You're our mentor,
you're supposed to go...

281
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:55,136
Encore.

282
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:56,496
Yeah.

283
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:59,376
Our mentor is supposed to tell us how
to get sponsors and give us advice.

284
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:01,456
Oh, okay.

285
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,136
Ummm...

286
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:07,656
Embrace the probability
of your immanent death.

287
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,696
I know.

288
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:10,976
Can your heart...

289
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:14,176
that there's nothing I
can do to save you.

290
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:17,056
So why are you here then?

291
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:19,736
The refreshments.

292
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:21,136
Okay, I think that's enough.

293
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:27,776
You made me spill my drink.

294
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,576
Over my new pants.

295
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:31,616
You know...

296
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:35,136
I think I'll go finish
this in my room.

297
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:52,456
I shouldn't have come around.

298
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:53,816
What? It's no use.

299
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:55,136
I'm gonna go talk to him.

300
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:05,896
We have two... 16 year olds.

301
00:25:09,296 --> 00:25:10,536
Yes.

302
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,536
Do you remember this year?

303
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,416
Aww. One of my favorite years.

304
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:15,936
And one of my favorite arenas.

305
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:18,736
The use of the rubble, the ruin city.

306
00:25:19,536 --> 00:25:20,656
Very exciting.

307
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:22,216
From this moment here...

308
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:23,176
...this moment...

309
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:25,256
.. is the moment that
you never forget.

310
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:26,256
The moment...

311
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:27,496
...when a Tribute...

312
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:29,416
...becomes a victor.

313
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:06,096
You'd freeze to death first.

314
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:07,576
Because I didn't light a fire.

315
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,336
Now that's a good
way to get killed.

316
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,056
What's a good way to get killed?

317
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,456
Oh! Joy.

318
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:15,296
Why don't you join us?

319
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:18,736
I'm just saving a life-saving advice.

320
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:21,536
Like what?

321
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:23,856
I wa... I was just asking
bout how to find shelter.

322
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:28,416
Which would come in handy if
in fact you are still alive.

323
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,856
How do you find shelter?

324
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:34,096
Pass the jam.

325
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:35,776
How do you find shelter?

326
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,976
Give me a chance to
wake up sweetheart.

327
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:41,736
This mentoring is very...

328
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:44,056
...tax and stuff.

329
00:26:49,496 --> 00:26:51,456
Can you pass the marmalade?

330
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:54,816
That is mahogany.

331
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:56,496
Look at you!

332
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:59,016
Just killed a... place mat!

333
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:02,496
You really wanna know
how to stay alive?

334
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:06,576
You get people to like you.

335
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:08,816
Oh!

336
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:10,856
Not what you're expecting.

337
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:14,576
When you're in the
middle of the games...

338
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:17,376
...and you're starving or freezing,

339
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:18,736
some water,

340
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:21,336
a knife or even some
matches can mean

341
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:23,936
the difference between
life and death.

342
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:26,976
And those things only
comes from Sponsors.

343
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:32,296
And to get Sponsors, you have
to make people like you.

344
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:35,176
And right now, sweetheart?

345
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:38,616
You're not off to a
really good start.

346
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:40,576
There it is.

347
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:47,136
It's huge.

348
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:50,016
That's incredible.

349
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:27,136
Come on.

350
00:28:31,736 --> 00:28:33,336
Better keep this knife.

351
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:35,216
He knows what he's doing.

352
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,816
So now that you've seen...

353
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:50,616
...what do you think of
this years cropful troops?

354
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:53,376
Are there any surprises that
we can expect this year?

355
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:56,536
It's really hard to tell from
a Reaping but I think...

356
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:58,696
...this is a very interesting mix.

357
00:28:58,736 --> 00:28:59,576
Yes.

358
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,816
Whenever you have a volunteer
from an outline district,

359
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:03,576
it's something you can't ignore.

360
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:33,096
What's that?

361
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:35,136
What's that?

362
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,576
We were just saying
we might need to hose

363
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,376
you down again before
we take you to Cinna.

364
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:49,095
That was all the bravest
thing I've ever seen.

365
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:52,015
I am Cinna.

366
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:53,255
Katniss.

367
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:55,215
I'm sorry that this happened to you.

368
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:57,375
And I'm here to help
you in any way I can.

369
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:01,975
Most people just congratulate me.

370
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,855
I don't see the point in that.

371
00:30:04,855 --> 00:30:06,095
Thank you girl.

372
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:15,935
What's this?

373
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:18,295
That's a... Mocking Jay.

374
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,015
How much?

375
00:30:24,095 --> 00:30:25,055
You keep it.

376
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:26,295
It's yours.

377
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:27,575
Thank you.

378
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:37,455
So tonight...

379
00:30:37,575 --> 00:30:38,935
...they have the Tribute Parade.

380
00:30:39,535 --> 00:30:41,615
Let me take you out and
show you after the wurl.

381
00:30:42,855 --> 00:30:44,575
So you're here to
make me look pretty.

382
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:46,295
I'm here to help you
make an impression.

383
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:49,935
Now usually, they dress people in
their close to their district.

384
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:51,175
Yeah. We're called minors.

385
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:52,455
Yeah. But I don't want to do that.

386
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:55,575
I'm gonna do something that
they're gonna remember.

387
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:58,215
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?

388
00:30:58,935 --> 00:31:01,095
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.

389
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:02,735
We'll see.

390
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:06,735
I just think, somebody that brave...

391
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:10,655
...shouldn't be dressed up on some
stupid costume as should they.

392
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,695
I hope not.

393
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:28,335
It's not real fire. These suits are
built so you won't feel a thing.

394
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:29,975
That's better on me.

395
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,295
The idea...

396
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:32,775
You ready?

397
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:33,775
Don't be afraid.

398
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:35,055
I'm not afraid.

399
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:58,095
Over one hundred
thousand people, craning

400
00:31:58,095 --> 00:32:00,895
to get a glimpse this
year's Tributes...

401
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:03,975
...and the Sponsors get to see
the Tributes for the first time.

402
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:06,895
The importance of this moment
cannot be over stated.

403
00:32:11,935 --> 00:32:13,455
They're nice.

404
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:15,855
First cheered on my counting in 15...

405
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:18,535
...14... 13...

406
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:22,855
Here they are. Here they are.

407
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:24,495
This year's Tributes.

408
00:32:25,175 --> 00:32:26,575
The most exciting run...

409
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,775
...it just gives you goosebumps.

410
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:30,855
Don't you love, how the stylist...

411
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:33,095
...they so clearly
are able to reflect

412
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:35,255
the character of each district.

413
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:37,975
There's District 4!

414
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:39,655
Fishing.

415
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:40,855
I get it. I like it.

416
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:42,095
That's very good.

417
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,135
And behind them...

418
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:47,975
.. we have two power plant workers.

419
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:49,255
And then...

420
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,935
...what is that in the background?

421
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:20,615
Come on. They'll love it.

422
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:30,375
Now see that? I love that.

423
00:33:30,415 --> 00:33:32,695
Two young people,
holding their hands up!

424
00:33:32,695 --> 00:33:34,655
Saying, "I'm proud,
I'm from District 12!

425
00:33:34,655 --> 00:33:36,575
We will not be overlooked!"

426
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:37,935
I love that.

427
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:41,175
We're gonna sure we'll be paying
attention to them right now!

428
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,655
And we're ready.

429
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:46,895
President Snow, you're live!

430
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,095
Welcome.

431
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:23,175
Welcome.

432
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:25,815
Tributes.

433
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:28,015
We welcome you.

434
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:30,935
We salute...

435
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:32,695
...the courage...

436
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,935
...and your sacrifice.

437
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:40,615
And we wish you...

438
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:44,295
...happy Hunger Games.

439
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:49,575
And may the odds be
ever in your favor.

440
00:35:01,815 --> 00:35:03,815
That was amazing.

441
00:35:03,855 --> 00:35:07,095
Oh, we are anybody's
going be talking about.

442
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:08,575
So brave.

443
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:10,695
Are you sure you're
spinning up a new flame?

444
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:12,095
Fake flame?

445
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:13,895
Are you sure?

446
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,735
That's uh...

447
00:35:23,015 --> 00:35:24,535
...let's go upstairs.

448
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:32,415
So each of the districts
got their own floor and

449
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:35,575
because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

450
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:43,415
Come on.

451
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:49,575
So this is the living room.

452
00:35:50,255 --> 00:35:52,655
I know!

453
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:55,615
Now, your rooms are right over here.

454
00:35:55,935 --> 00:36:00,535
Why don't you go clean yourselves
up a little before dinner.

455
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:18,214
In two weeks...

456
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:20,654
...23 of you will be dead.

457
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:23,014
One of you will be alive.

458
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,494
Who that is depends
on how well you pay

459
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,814
attention over the
next four days.

460
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:30,134
Particularly to what
I'm about to say.

461
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:33,174
First. No fighting with
the other Tributes.

462
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:35,734
You'll have plenty of time
for that in the arena.

463
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:40,294
There are four compulsory exercises,
the rest will be individual training.

464
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:41,454
My advice is...

465
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:43,414
Don't ignore the survival skills.

466
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:45,894
Everybody wants to
grab a sword but most

467
00:37:45,894 --> 00:37:48,334
of you wil die from
natural causes.

468
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:50,134
10% from infection.

469
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,894
20% from dehydration.

470
00:37:52,054 --> 00:37:54,734
Exposure can kill as
easily as a knife.

471
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:28,294
Where's my knife?

472
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:29,334
Where did you put it?

473
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:30,094
I put my knife...

474
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:31,334
Don't touch me...

475
00:38:31,494 --> 00:38:33,014
Fuck! You took my knife!

476
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:35,134
I didn't touch your knife.
I didn't touch your kni...

477
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:36,094
You liar.

478
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:37,174
You little punk!

479
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:38,414
You took my knife.

480
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:39,534
Get off me.

481
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:40,774
Just sit here.

482
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:44,734
I should better wait for the arena.

483
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:46,854
You're the first one I get
so watch your back huh!

484
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,054
Everybody back in line.

485
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:52,494
You know you're next to me Cato!

486
00:38:53,174 --> 00:38:54,494
Busy career.

487
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:55,654
You know what that is?

488
00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:56,774
From District 1.

489
00:38:56,774 --> 00:38:57,734
...and 2.

490
00:38:57,734 --> 00:39:00,294
They've been trying to be
in a special academy till

491
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:02,854
they're 18 and they volunteer.
By that point...

492
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,614
...they're pretty lethal.

493
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:07,174
But they don't receive
any special treatment.

494
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:09,774
In fact, they're staying at the
exact same apartment as you do.

495
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:12,614
And I don't think left them
out for dessert and you can.

496
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,374
So how good all that?

497
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:18,614
Obviously, they're pretty good.

498
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:20,374
They won in almost
several year but...

499
00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:21,654
Almost...

500
00:39:21,854 --> 00:39:23,334
They can be arrogant.

501
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:28,134
And arrogance can
be a big problem.

502
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,614
I hear you can shoot..

503
00:39:34,654 --> 00:39:35,934
I'm alright.

504
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:37,374
Actually, better than alright.

505
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:39,174
I fed her by the squirrels.

506
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:42,694
He say she hits em right
in the eye, everytime.

507
00:39:44,654 --> 00:39:46,254
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

508
00:39:46,254 --> 00:39:47,814
He can throw a 100
pound sack of flour

509
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,134
right in his head. I've seen it.

510
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:51,654
Okay, well I cannot kill
anybody by a sack of flour.

511
00:39:51,694 --> 00:39:53,294
No, you might have a
better chance at winning

512
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,894
when somebody comes
after you with a knife.

513
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,854
I have no chance of winning.
None! Alright?

514
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:04,494
It's true.

515
00:40:05,014 --> 00:40:06,294
Everybody knows it.

516
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,414
You know what my mother said?

517
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:14,014
She said, "District 12 might
finally have a winner!"

518
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:16,894
But she wasn't talking about me.

519
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:19,734
She was talking about you.

520
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:27,294
I'm not very hungry.

521
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:06,894
I'm done too.

522
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:51,214
Throw that metal
thing over there.

523
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:52,854
What?

524
00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:56,334
No.

525
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:57,774
Haymitch says we're not
supposed to show...

526
00:41:57,814 --> 00:41:59,054
I don't care what Haymitch said.

527
00:41:59,094 --> 00:42:01,254
Those guys are looking at
you like you're a meal.

528
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:02,814
Throw it.

529
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:48,654
Hi.

530
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:50,614
Hey.

531
00:42:50,614 --> 00:42:51,854
How did you do that?

532
00:42:52,934 --> 00:42:54,174
I uh...

533
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:56,374
I used to take care of the
cakes down at the bakery.

534
00:42:57,614 --> 00:42:58,854
I'll show you.

535
00:43:01,134 --> 00:43:02,414
See?

536
00:43:03,174 --> 00:43:04,134
Wow.

537
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:05,414
Yeah.

538
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:08,814
I think you have a shadow.

539
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:37,494
Tomorrow.
They will bring you in one by one.

540
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:39,054
And evaluate you.

541
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:43,254
This is important because high
ratings will mean Sponsors.

542
00:43:43,294 --> 00:43:45,934
This is the time to
show them everything.

543
00:43:45,974 --> 00:43:48,534
There'll be a bow,
make sure you use it.

544
00:43:48,654 --> 00:43:50,774
Peeta, you make sure
to show your strength.

545
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:55,334
They'll start with District 1
so the two of you will go last.

546
00:43:56,174 --> 00:43:57,974
Not on my house to put this...

547
00:43:58,014 --> 00:43:59,774
Make sure they remember you!

548
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,413
Katniss Everdeen.

549
00:44:24,893 --> 00:44:26,133
Hey Katniss.

550
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:28,373
Shoot straight.

551
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:30,493
Katniss Everdeen.

552
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:33,373
District 12.

553
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:25,653
Thank you.

554
00:47:25,773 --> 00:47:27,453
For your consideration.

555
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:33,973
Are you crazy?

556
00:47:33,973 --> 00:47:35,093
I just got mad.

557
00:47:35,093 --> 00:47:36,373
Mad?!

558
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:40,773
You realize that your actions
reflect badly on all of us.

559
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:42,053
Not just you.

560
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:43,493
They just want a good
show, it's fine.

561
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:45,653
How bout just bad manners Cinna?

562
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:47,053
How bout that?

563
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:48,973
Well, finally!

564
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:52,173
I hope you notice, we
have a serious situation.

565
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,493
Nice shooting sweetheart!

566
00:47:58,853 --> 00:48:01,253
Wha.. Wha... What did they...

567
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,693
What did they do when
you shot the apple?

568
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:05,733
Well, they look pretty startled.

569
00:48:09,173 --> 00:48:11,933
What did you say... "Thanks for... "

570
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,013
...consideration. Genius!

571
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:15,653
Genius.

572
00:48:15,653 --> 00:48:17,973
How do you think you're
gonna find this funny?

573
00:48:17,973 --> 00:48:20,333
If the game makers decided
to take it out...

574
00:48:20,373 --> 00:48:21,933
On who? On her?

575
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:23,773
On him?

576
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:25,173
I think they already have.

577
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,933
Loosen your corset and have a drink.

578
00:48:28,213 --> 00:48:31,053
I would have given
anything to see it.

579
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:35,093
As you know the Tributes
are rated on a scale of

580
00:48:35,093 --> 00:48:38,093
1 to 12 after three days
of careful evaluation.

581
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:40,693
The game keepers would
like to evaluate...

582
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:45,493
From District 1, Marvel.

583
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:48,413
The score of 9.

584
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:50,933
Cato, the score of 10.

585
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:53,373
Clove, the score of 10.

586
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:56,573
Four, score of...

587
00:48:56,653 --> 00:48:58,013
From District 7...

588
00:48:58,053 --> 00:48:59,333
From District...

589
00:49:00,413 --> 00:49:03,133
Rue, the score of 7.

590
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:06,493
From District 12...

591
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:11,493
Peeta Mellark...

592
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,693
The score of...

593
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:16,493
8.

594
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:19,293
Not bad. Bravo.

595
00:49:24,533 --> 00:49:25,933
And finally...

596
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:29,893
From District 12...

597
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:33,413
Katniss Everdeen...

598
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:38,933
With the score of...

599
00:49:42,093 --> 00:49:43,333
...eleven.

600
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:50,493
Congratulations.

601
00:49:50,973 --> 00:49:52,293
I thought they hated me.

602
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,893
They must have like you girl.

603
00:49:53,933 --> 00:49:55,613
To Katniss Everdeen...

604
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:58,253
The Girl On Fire!

605
00:50:01,213 --> 00:50:02,493
At eleven?

606
00:50:02,853 --> 00:50:03,893
She earned it.

607
00:50:03,893 --> 00:50:06,013
She shot an arrow at your head.

608
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:07,293
Well, t'was an apple.

609
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,573
...near your head.

610
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:10,653
Sit down.

611
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:17,213
Seneca...

612
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,773
...why do you think we have a winner?

613
00:50:21,493 --> 00:50:22,733
What do you mean?

614
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:25,133
I mean...

615
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:28,053
...why do we have a winner?

616
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:32,053
I mean if we just
wanted to intimidate

617
00:50:32,053 --> 00:50:33,973
the Districts, why not round up

618
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:37,813
24 of them at random and execute
them all at once. Way a lot faster...

619
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:41,933
Hope.

620
00:50:42,813 --> 00:50:44,053
Hope?

621
00:50:44,293 --> 00:50:45,533
Hope.

622
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:49,533
It is the only thing...
stronger than fear.

623
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,013
A little hope is effective.

624
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:53,773
A lot of hope is dangerous.

625
00:50:54,253 --> 00:50:57,693
It's track is fine..
As long as it's contained.

626
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:01,653
So...

627
00:51:02,213 --> 00:51:05,533
So... contain it!

628
00:51:36,452 --> 00:51:37,732
Right.

629
00:51:38,092 --> 00:51:41,372
If she's staring at all my jewels,
she can't take her eye from...

630
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:43,412
Frankly... it was rude.

631
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:45,972
Oh, Haymitch.
You should join us.

632
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:48,452
We're having some of
your favorite dish.

633
00:51:48,812 --> 00:51:50,292
Oh, lovely.

634
00:51:54,052 --> 00:51:55,012
Where's Peeta?

635
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:57,812
He's in his room. Now listen...

636
00:51:58,252 --> 00:51:59,732
Tomorrow's the last day.

637
00:51:59,772 --> 00:52:02,692
When they let us walk with
our own Tributes right

638
00:52:02,692 --> 00:52:05,572
before the game so you and
I will be going down at 9.

639
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:08,532
Well, what about him?

640
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:12,412
No, he says he wants to be
trained on his own from now on.

641
00:52:13,892 --> 00:52:15,172
What?

642
00:52:15,572 --> 00:52:18,332
It's kind of thing does happen
at this point if there's...

643
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:20,812
...only one winner. Right?

644
00:52:27,172 --> 00:52:29,132
We should have some
chocolate covered stoke.

645
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:37,732
Ladies and gentlemen.
Your master of ceremonies...

646
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:42,532
Caesar Flickerman!

647
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:47,412
Thank you!

648
00:52:48,452 --> 00:52:51,932
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

649
00:52:51,972 --> 00:52:55,412
To the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

650
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:59,612
Now, there are five minutes they
are all going to be out here.

651
00:52:59,812 --> 00:53:02,692
All of the Tributes
that you heard about.

652
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:04,492
Are you excited?

653
00:53:04,532 --> 00:53:06,292
Let me hear it!

654
00:53:09,652 --> 00:53:10,892
Amazing.

655
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,172
I don't feel amazing.

656
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:15,932
Don't you know how
beautiful you look?

657
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:17,732
No. And I don't know
how to make people

658
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:19,492
like me, how do you
make people like you?

659
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:20,572
Why do you made me like you?

660
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,292
That's different.
I wasn't trying.

661
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:23,412
Exactly.

662
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:26,492
Just be yourself.
I'll be there the whole time.

663
00:53:26,532 --> 00:53:28,572
...and just pretend
you're talking to me.

664
00:53:28,812 --> 00:53:30,092
Okay?

665
00:53:30,532 --> 00:53:31,292
Okay.

666
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:34,132
Let's see if she
does indeed shine.

667
00:53:34,132 --> 00:53:36,892
Let's have a warm round
of applause for Glimmer.

668
00:53:41,412 --> 00:53:43,132
Glimmer, are you prepared?

669
00:53:43,332 --> 00:53:44,892
Yes Caesar, I am prepared.

670
00:53:44,932 --> 00:53:46,492
I like it, that's just...

671
00:53:52,052 --> 00:53:54,532
Big round of applause.

672
00:53:56,892 --> 00:53:58,132
Marvel!

673
00:54:00,892 --> 00:54:02,652
Welcome Clove.

674
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:04,052
It's an honor to
represent my district.

675
00:54:04,052 --> 00:54:04,852
So you're a fighter?

676
00:54:04,852 --> 00:54:07,292
I'm prepared, vicious
and I'm ready to go.

677
00:54:08,372 --> 00:54:09,612
Cato!

678
00:54:34,252 --> 00:54:36,052
From District 12...

679
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:38,372
You know her...

680
00:54:38,412 --> 00:54:42,972
...as the girl on fire!

681
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:47,212
Where we know it's Katniss Everdeen!

682
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:17,212
What?

683
00:55:18,572 --> 00:55:20,372
I think someone's a little nervous.

684
00:55:22,492 --> 00:55:24,892
I said that was quite and
entrance that you've

685
00:55:24,892 --> 00:55:27,252
made at the Tribute's
Parade the other day.

686
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:28,532
Do you want to tell us about it?

687
00:55:30,172 --> 00:55:31,572
Well, I was just...

688
00:55:31,852 --> 00:55:33,892
...hoping that I
wouldn't burned it up!

689
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:43,932
When you came out of that chariot...

690
00:55:43,972 --> 00:55:45,212
I have to say...

691
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:47,612
My heart... stopped.

692
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:50,132
To earn you experiences as well.

693
00:55:50,572 --> 00:55:51,812
My heart stopped.

694
00:55:54,732 --> 00:55:56,092
So did mine.

695
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:00,692
Now tell me bout the flames...
are they real?

696
00:56:01,412 --> 00:56:02,652
Yes.

697
00:56:07,172 --> 00:56:08,972
In fact I'm wearing them today.

698
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:11,052
Would you like to see?

699
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:13,252
Wait, wait, wait.

700
00:56:13,732 --> 00:56:14,972
Is it safe?

701
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:17,892
What do you think folks?

702
00:56:19,652 --> 00:56:21,172
I think that's a yes!

703
00:56:54,932 --> 00:56:56,412
That was really something.

704
00:56:56,492 --> 00:56:58,492
Katniss, that was something.

705
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:00,572
Thank you for that.

706
00:57:02,812 --> 00:57:04,452
I have one more question for you.

707
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:08,132
It's about your sister...

708
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:13,932
We are all very moved,
I think when...

709
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:17,132
...you volunteered for
her at the Reaping.

710
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:20,852
Does she come to say goodbye to you.

711
00:57:21,892 --> 00:57:23,132
Yes.

712
00:57:23,372 --> 00:57:25,012
She did.

713
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,332
And what did you say to her?

714
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:31,052
In the end?

715
00:57:33,732 --> 00:57:35,772
I told her that I would try to win.

716
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:39,492
That I will try to win for her.

717
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:42,452
Of course you did.

718
00:57:44,532 --> 00:57:46,012
And try you will.

719
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:50,492
Ladies and gentlemen,
from District 12,

720
00:57:50,492 --> 00:57:53,732
Katniss Everdeen,
The Girl On Fire!

721
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:01,052
You did it darling.

722
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:02,252
That was incredible.

723
00:58:02,252 --> 00:58:03,492
Thank you.

724
00:58:03,852 --> 00:58:06,212
Nice job sweetheart.

725
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:08,092
Thank you.

726
00:58:08,092 --> 00:58:09,852
Nice dress too.

727
00:58:10,692 --> 00:58:12,532
Are yours?

728
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,372
Peeta Mellark!

729
00:58:20,692 --> 00:58:22,772
Peeta, welcome.

730
00:58:23,092 --> 00:58:25,732
How are you finding the Capitol?
Don't say with a map.

731
00:58:27,052 --> 00:58:28,532
Uh, it's uh... different.

732
00:58:28,572 --> 00:58:29,812
It's very different.

733
00:58:29,812 --> 00:58:32,171
Different? In what are?
Give us an example.

734
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:35,371
Uh okay, well the
showers here are weird.

735
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:36,211
Showers?

736
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:36,971
Yes.

737
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,251
We have different showers.

738
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:39,971
I have a question for you Caesar.

739
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:41,651
Do I smell like roses to you?

740
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:45,291
Um...

741
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:48,251
Do I?

742
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:49,051
Yeah.

743
00:58:49,051 --> 00:58:50,331
Do I smell like it?

744
00:58:56,691 --> 00:58:58,051
You definitely smell
better than I do.

745
00:58:58,091 --> 00:58:59,331
Well I live here longer.

746
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:07,051
So Peeta...

747
00:59:07,051 --> 00:59:08,291
...tell me.

748
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:10,611
Is there a special girl back home?

749
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:13,211
No, not really.

750
00:59:13,251 --> 00:59:16,171
No? I don't believe it for a second.

751
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:19,331
Look at that face.
Handsome man like you... Peeta.

752
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:21,931
Tell me.

753
00:59:23,771 --> 00:59:25,091
Well, there a...

754
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:27,371
There's this one girl that...

755
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:28,971
I had a crush on forever.

756
00:59:30,211 --> 00:59:34,011
But I don't think she actually
recognize me until the Reaping.

757
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:37,691
Well...

758
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:39,211
I'll tell you what Peeta.

759
00:59:40,531 --> 00:59:41,771
You go out there...

760
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:43,931
...and you win this thing.

761
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:45,651
And when you get home.

762
00:59:45,691 --> 00:59:47,611
She'll have to go out with you.

763
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:49,451
Right folks?

764
00:59:52,691 --> 00:59:54,291
Thanks but I uh...

765
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,891
I don't think winnings
gonna help me at all.

766
00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:57,491
And why not?

767
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,651
Because she came here with me.

768
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,051
Well, that's bad luck.

769
01:00:10,131 --> 01:00:11,411
Yeah. It is.

770
01:00:13,211 --> 01:00:15,211
And I wish you all the best of luck.

771
01:00:15,451 --> 01:00:16,691
Thank you.

772
01:00:17,171 --> 01:00:18,411
Peeta Mellark.

773
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:21,011
District 12!

774
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:27,011
What the hell is that?!

775
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:29,171
You don't talk to me and you
say you have a crush on me?

776
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:31,291
You say you wanna train alone...
is that how you wanna play?

777
01:00:31,331 --> 01:00:32,731
Stop! Stop it!

778
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:34,171
Start right now.

779
01:00:35,891 --> 01:00:36,931
He did you a favor.

780
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:37,891
He made me look weak.

781
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:39,531
He made you look desirable.

782
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:41,971
Which in your case,
can't hurt sweetheart!

783
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:43,171
He's right Katniss.

784
01:00:43,171 --> 01:00:44,371
Of course, I'm right.

785
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:47,811
Now I can sell the star cross
lovers from District 12.

786
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:49,251
We are not star cross lovers.

787
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,851
It's a television show.

788
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:54,051
And being in love with
that boy might just get

789
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:56,811
you Sponsors which could
save your damn life.

790
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:01,091
Okay...
why don't you get out of here?

791
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:04,411
Maybe acting to live save you
both to one piece tomorrow.

792
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:06,091
Manners.

793
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:38,611
You too?

794
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:41,451
Oh, hey.

795
01:01:42,211 --> 01:01:43,371
Can't sleep?

796
01:01:43,411 --> 01:01:45,491
No, of course not.

797
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:49,411
I'm sorry I went after you.

798
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:53,851
You know I meant that
as a compliment.

799
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,491
I know.

800
01:02:07,571 --> 01:02:08,811
Listen...

801
01:02:11,011 --> 01:02:12,251
Yeah?

802
01:02:16,451 --> 01:02:18,131
I just don't wanna change me.

803
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:22,091
So tonight...

804
01:02:22,211 --> 01:02:23,571
...they have the Tribute Parade.

805
01:02:24,171 --> 01:02:26,291
Let me take you out and
show you after the wurl.

806
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:29,251
So you're here to
make me look pretty.

807
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:30,971
I'm here to help you
make an impression.

808
01:02:31,891 --> 01:02:34,651
Now usually, they dress people in
their close to their district.

809
01:02:34,691 --> 01:02:35,891
Yeah. We're called minors.

810
01:02:35,891 --> 01:02:37,171
Yeah. But I don't want to do that.

811
01:02:38,411 --> 01:02:40,331
I'm gonna do something that
they're gonna remember.

812
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,971
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?

813
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:45,891
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.

814
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:47,491
We'll see.

815
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:52,411
How did they change you?

816
01:02:56,051 --> 01:02:57,291
I don't know.

817
01:02:57,371 --> 01:02:59,131
I'm turning to something I'm not.

818
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:03,931
I just don't wanna be another
piece in their game, you know?

819
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,251
You mean you won't kill anyone?

820
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:11,571
No.

821
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:13,931
I'm not yet sure I would.

822
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:16,331
Just like any by off
my time came with.

823
01:03:17,691 --> 01:03:19,291
Yeah, I just keep...

824
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:20,931
wishing I could think
of a way to show them.

825
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:22,691
That they don't own me.

826
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:28,651
You know, if I'm gonna die.

827
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:31,131
I wanna still be me.

828
01:03:36,851 --> 01:03:38,131
Does that make any sense?

829
01:03:38,771 --> 01:03:40,011
Yeah.

830
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:44,131
I just can't afford
to think like that.

831
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:50,091
I miss my sister.

832
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:53,811
Yeah I know.

833
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:09,931
Guess, I'll see you tomorrow.

834
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,091
See you tomorrow.

835
01:04:40,451 --> 01:04:42,971
They put all kind of
stuff right in front.

836
01:04:43,011 --> 01:04:45,291
Right in the mouth of the Curnocopia.

837
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:47,691
There'll even be a bow there.

838
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:48,611
Don't go for it.

839
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:49,571
Why not?

840
01:04:49,571 --> 01:04:51,651
It's a Bloodbath, they're
trying to pull you in.

841
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:53,731
It's not your game.

842
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:56,571
You turn, run, find
a high ground.

843
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:59,331
Look for water.
Water's your new best friend.

844
01:05:00,531 --> 01:05:04,931
Don't step off that pedestal earlier
or they'll blow you sky high.

845
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:06,211
I won't.

846
01:05:17,611 --> 01:05:19,011
Katniss.

847
01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:21,691
You can do this.

848
01:05:29,331 --> 01:05:30,571
Thanks.

849
01:05:34,971 --> 01:05:36,291
Give me your arm.

850
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:42,370
Give me your arm.

851
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,130
Give me your arm.

852
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:51,370
What is that?

853
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:54,850
Your tracker.

854
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,170
Less than a minute people!

855
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:05,810
Final checks.

856
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:08,170
So fifteen up, they are flying.

857
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:46,850
Here.

858
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,530
Thank you.

859
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,130
30 seconds.

860
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,930
I'm not allowed to bet.

861
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,010
But if i could I'd bet on you!

862
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:44,170
20 seconds.

863
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:57,930
10 seconds.

864
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:25,890
Okay, they're in the tubes.

865
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,130
50...

866
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:08,330
...49...

867
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:09,490
...48...

868
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:11,650
...47... 46...

869
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,770
...45... 44...

870
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:15,850
...43... 42...

871
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:17,930
...41... 40...

872
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:20,010
...39... 38...

873
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:22,090
...37... 36...

874
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,450
...35... 34...

875
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,730
...33... 32...

876
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,930
...31... 30...

877
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:31,010
...29... 28

878
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:33,170
...27... 26...

879
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,250
...25... 24...

880
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:37,330
...23... 22...

881
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:48,410
And of course...

882
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:52,090
There's the familiar
boom of the cannon.

883
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:55,409
Which marks the end of
another fallen Tribute.

884
01:16:27,789 --> 01:16:32,189
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

885
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:36,629
And Claudius, I think I
seen alliance forming.

886
01:16:45,749 --> 01:16:47,749
Please don't kill me. Oh no!

887
01:16:50,789 --> 01:16:52,029
Hey, loverboy!

888
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:54,789
You sure she went this way?

889
01:16:54,829 --> 01:16:56,109
Yeah, I'm sure.

890
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:58,149
You better be.

891
01:16:58,549 --> 01:17:00,229
Yeah. That was a steer
comb back there.

892
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,989
Are you sure we shouldn't
just kill him now?

893
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,949
Nah. He's our best
chance at finding her.

894
01:17:33,469 --> 01:17:34,709
Sir.

895
01:17:36,589 --> 01:17:39,029
She is almost at the edge.

896
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:41,149
Two kilometers away from
the nearest Tribute.

897
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,429
Let's turn her around.

898
01:18:43,829 --> 01:18:46,509
Killing another on my account... one.

899
01:18:46,549 --> 01:18:47,789
Two.

900
01:18:58,669 --> 01:19:00,989
Uh, she's heading
towards the left flank.

901
01:19:00,989 --> 01:19:02,269
Okay.

902
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:04,989
Sure.

903
01:19:57,789 --> 01:19:59,189
She's almost there.

904
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:16,429
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

905
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:28,949
Oh there she is. There she is.

906
01:21:11,228 --> 01:21:12,508
What you got baby?

907
01:21:41,588 --> 01:21:42,828
Kill here Cato!

908
01:21:47,748 --> 01:21:49,708
I'm coming for you!

909
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:56,188
I'll do it myself.

910
01:22:05,348 --> 01:22:06,148
Get her!

911
01:22:06,148 --> 01:22:07,388
Come on. Come on.

912
01:22:10,268 --> 01:22:12,228
Maybe you should throw the sword.

913
01:22:13,148 --> 01:22:14,388
Let's just wait her out.

914
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:19,668
She's gonna come down at some points.
That's gonne start her there.

915
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:27,748
Okay.

916
01:22:28,748 --> 01:22:30,028
Somebody make a fire.

917
01:25:22,108 --> 01:25:23,388
Thank you.

918
01:26:05,948 --> 01:26:07,268
Pssst.

919
01:26:08,668 --> 01:26:09,948
Pssst.

920
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:36,748
Claudius. I think those are
trackerjackers. Am I wrong?

921
01:26:37,228 --> 01:26:38,508
Oooh.

922
01:26:39,828 --> 01:26:41,708
Those things are very lethal.

923
01:26:41,948 --> 01:26:42,948
Very.

924
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,148
For those of you who don't know.

925
01:26:45,148 --> 01:26:47,348
Trackerjackers are genetically
engineered wasps.

926
01:26:47,388 --> 01:26:49,668
Whose venom causes serious pain.

927
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:55,068
Powerful hallucinations and
in extreme cases, death.

928
01:29:53,827 --> 01:29:55,067
Run!

929
01:29:55,747 --> 01:29:56,987
Run!

930
01:29:58,547 --> 01:29:59,707
Run!

931
01:29:59,707 --> 01:30:01,427
Damn it. Go!

932
01:30:02,707 --> 01:30:05,147
Katniss, no! What're you doing?

933
01:30:05,187 --> 01:30:06,467
Go!

934
01:30:17,307 --> 01:30:18,867
Hallow isn't lethal.

935
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:21,987
But the venom of a
trackerjacker sting...

936
01:30:22,627 --> 01:30:26,147
...is enough to doze
off hallucinations.

937
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:29,587
Please do something.

938
01:31:30,187 --> 01:31:31,907
Katniss, go!

939
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:37,427
Get out of here!
What're you doing? Go!

940
01:32:36,947 --> 01:32:38,187
Rue?

941
01:32:41,627 --> 01:32:43,787
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

942
01:33:01,747 --> 01:33:02,987
You want mine too?

943
01:33:04,387 --> 01:33:05,667
No, that's okay.

944
01:33:07,067 --> 01:33:08,307
Here.

945
01:33:08,907 --> 01:33:10,147
Thanks.

946
01:33:15,147 --> 01:33:16,547
How long was I asleep?

947
01:33:17,347 --> 01:33:18,987
A couple of days.

948
01:33:19,507 --> 01:33:21,067
I change your leaves twice.

949
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:24,427
Thank you.

950
01:33:25,987 --> 01:33:27,867
So what happened? When I was out?

951
01:33:29,227 --> 01:33:31,667
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.

952
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:34,907
And the uh...

953
01:33:35,827 --> 01:33:37,387
And the boy from my district?

954
01:33:39,067 --> 01:33:40,347
No, he's okay.

955
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:42,227
I think he's down by the river.

956
01:33:45,747 --> 01:33:47,027
Is all about true?

957
01:33:47,667 --> 01:33:48,907
What?

958
01:33:49,387 --> 01:33:50,667
You and him.

959
01:33:52,267 --> 01:33:53,907
So where are Cato and the others?

960
01:33:54,387 --> 01:33:56,507
They got all their
supplies down by the lake.

961
01:33:57,107 --> 01:33:59,147
It's prod up in this
great big pyramid.

962
01:34:00,027 --> 01:34:01,427
That sounds tempting.

963
01:34:17,587 --> 01:34:20,067
Now this green stuff is
gonna smoke like crazy, so

964
01:34:20,067 --> 01:34:22,547
as soon as you light it.
Move on to the next fire.

965
01:34:22,587 --> 01:34:24,027
Light this one last.

966
01:34:24,067 --> 01:34:25,467
And I'll meet you back over here.

967
01:34:25,507 --> 01:34:26,747
Right.

968
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:32,867
I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

969
01:34:33,027 --> 01:34:35,427
We need a signal, in case
one of us gets held up.

970
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:36,707
Okay. Like what?

971
01:34:38,867 --> 01:34:40,107
Here. Watch this.

972
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:47,627
Mocking jays.

973
01:34:48,427 --> 01:34:49,267
That's great.

974
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:51,307
Back home, we used them
to signal all the time..

975
01:34:56,907 --> 01:34:58,187
You try.

976
01:35:07,587 --> 01:35:12,467
Okay so, if we hear that means we're
okay and we'll be back real soon.

977
01:35:13,147 --> 01:35:14,427
We're gonna be okay.

978
01:35:20,267 --> 01:35:21,507
Hey.

979
01:35:21,827 --> 01:35:23,307
I'll see you for supper.

980
01:35:24,747 --> 01:35:27,187
Okay.

981
01:35:54,906 --> 01:35:56,546
Guys, guys look!

982
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:58,546
Come here. Come on, come on look!

983
01:36:02,986 --> 01:36:04,026
Let's go.

984
01:36:04,026 --> 01:36:05,866
You stay guard over till we get back.

985
01:36:35,786 --> 01:36:38,786
I wanna see if she's gonna
figure out this booby trap.

986
01:36:38,906 --> 01:36:41,306
Yes. It seems they
reburied their mines

987
01:36:41,306 --> 01:36:43,706
around that big pile of goodies.

988
01:36:55,946 --> 01:36:58,986
She certainly figure
it out, haven't she?

989
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:10,786
Katniss!

990
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:14,066
Katniss!

991
01:40:16,146 --> 01:40:17,746
Katniss help!

992
01:40:19,186 --> 01:40:20,426
Katniss!

993
01:40:24,986 --> 01:40:27,466
Help me! Help!

994
01:40:28,786 --> 01:40:30,066
Katniss!

995
01:40:30,586 --> 01:40:31,906
Katniss!

996
01:40:32,946 --> 01:40:34,186
It's okay.

997
01:40:43,186 --> 01:40:44,426
You're okay.

998
01:40:44,546 --> 01:40:45,506
You're alright.

999
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:47,186
You're fine.. see?

1000
01:41:15,706 --> 01:41:16,906
It's okay.

1001
01:41:16,906 --> 01:41:18,146
You're okay.

1002
01:41:18,346 --> 01:41:19,586
You're okay.

1003
01:41:19,826 --> 01:41:21,066
You're okay.

1004
01:41:28,106 --> 01:41:29,986
Did you blow up the food?

1005
01:41:33,106 --> 01:41:34,346
Every bit of it.

1006
01:41:37,906 --> 01:41:39,146
Good.

1007
01:41:41,346 --> 01:41:43,266
You have to win.

1008
01:41:57,826 --> 01:41:59,066
Okay.

1009
01:42:06,546 --> 01:42:10,306
Deep in the meadow.

1010
01:42:10,906 --> 01:42:14,546
Under the willow.

1011
01:42:15,266 --> 01:42:18,586
A bed of grass.

1012
01:42:18,626 --> 01:42:22,786
A soft, green pillow.

1013
01:42:23,626 --> 01:42:26,706
Lay down your head.

1014
01:42:27,226 --> 01:42:30,786
And close your eyes.

1015
01:46:25,785 --> 01:46:27,345
Don't kill her.

1016
01:46:27,385 --> 01:46:28,905
You just create a murder.

1017
01:46:28,945 --> 01:46:30,185
It seems I've already got one.

1018
01:46:30,225 --> 01:46:32,265
I heard this rumors
out on District 11.

1019
01:46:32,305 --> 01:46:33,705
This could get away from here.

1020
01:46:33,745 --> 01:46:35,105
What do you want?

1021
01:46:35,625 --> 01:46:37,945
There are a lot of
anger out there.

1022
01:46:37,945 --> 01:46:40,305
I know you know how to handle
a mod, you've done it before.

1023
01:46:40,425 --> 01:46:45,665
If you can't scare them.
Give them something to root for.

1024
01:46:46,585 --> 01:46:47,825
Such as?

1025
01:46:50,185 --> 01:46:51,465
Young love.

1026
01:46:53,385 --> 01:46:55,225
So you were like an underdog.

1027
01:46:55,265 --> 01:46:57,065
Everyone likes an underdog.

1028
01:46:57,105 --> 01:46:58,385
I don't.

1029
01:46:59,865 --> 01:47:01,265
How many are dead?

1030
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:03,185
10? 11? 12?

1031
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:04,505
Uh...

1032
01:47:04,505 --> 01:47:05,985
Not personally, no!

1033
01:47:06,585 --> 01:47:07,865
I have.

1034
01:47:09,105 --> 01:47:10,665
Lots of underdogs.

1035
01:47:11,225 --> 01:47:12,665
Not too cold too.

1036
01:47:13,185 --> 01:47:14,985
Row crops. Minerals.

1037
01:47:15,785 --> 01:47:17,145
Things we need.

1038
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:20,425
There are lots of underdogs.

1039
01:47:21,585 --> 01:47:24,065
And I think if you could see them.

1040
01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:27,305
You would not root for them either.

1041
01:47:29,905 --> 01:47:31,345
Unlike you..

1042
01:47:34,545 --> 01:47:35,825
Be careful.

1043
01:47:46,905 --> 01:47:49,225
Attention Tributes. Attention!

1044
01:47:49,265 --> 01:47:54,105
The regulations required a single
victor has been... suspended!

1045
01:47:54,145 --> 01:47:58,145
From now on, two victors maybe
crowned if both originate

1046
01:47:58,145 --> 01:48:02,185
from the same district.
This will be the only announcement.

1047
01:49:06,145 --> 01:49:07,705
Oh my God! Peeta!

1048
01:49:08,105 --> 01:49:09,345
Peeta!

1049
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:13,385
Hi.

1050
01:49:16,545 --> 01:49:17,785
It's okay.

1051
01:49:33,305 --> 01:49:34,545
What was it?

1052
01:49:35,065 --> 01:49:36,345
The sword.

1053
01:49:37,825 --> 01:49:39,065
It's badly hurt.

1054
01:49:40,745 --> 01:49:41,985
It's gonna be fine.

1055
01:49:55,104 --> 01:49:56,344
Katniss...

1056
01:49:59,784 --> 01:50:00,624
Katniss...

1057
01:50:00,624 --> 01:50:01,864
No!

1058
01:50:02,904 --> 01:50:04,184
I'm not gonna leave you!

1059
01:50:04,984 --> 01:50:06,504
I'm not gonna do that.

1060
01:50:14,304 --> 01:50:15,544
Why not?

1061
01:50:35,664 --> 01:50:38,224
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

1062
01:50:38,464 --> 01:50:39,864
They already found me.

1063
01:50:44,064 --> 01:50:46,264
We just get you some medicine.

1064
01:50:46,504 --> 01:50:48,424
He can't.
They don't give so much parachutes.

1065
01:50:49,504 --> 01:50:50,744
We'll figure something out.

1066
01:50:51,784 --> 01:50:53,024
Like what?

1067
01:50:53,944 --> 01:50:55,184
Something.

1068
01:51:56,544 --> 01:51:57,824
Is that medicine?

1069
01:51:57,864 --> 01:51:58,784
No!

1070
01:51:58,784 --> 01:52:00,024
Soup.

1071
01:52:11,664 --> 01:52:13,184
Nice taste.

1072
01:52:15,264 --> 01:52:17,304
Do you fed - once?

1073
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,944
I think about that all the time.

1074
01:52:24,104 --> 01:52:25,664
How I tossed you that bread.

1075
01:52:25,944 --> 01:52:26,704
Peeta.

1076
01:52:26,704 --> 01:52:28,584
I should've gone to you.

1077
01:52:28,584 --> 01:52:30,504
I should've just gone
out to the rain.

1078
01:52:33,264 --> 01:52:34,824
You feel hot.

1079
01:52:37,144 --> 01:52:39,184
I remember the first time I saw you.

1080
01:52:40,624 --> 01:52:43,144
Your hair was in two
braids instead of one.

1081
01:52:44,064 --> 01:52:45,384
I remember when you...

1082
01:52:45,704 --> 01:52:48,504
You sang in music as
simply the teacher said.

1083
01:52:48,544 --> 01:52:51,664
Who knows the pie song in
your head shut straight up!

1084
01:52:53,344 --> 01:52:54,864
After that...

1085
01:52:55,344 --> 01:52:57,304
I watched you going home everyday.

1086
01:52:59,984 --> 01:53:01,224
Everyday.

1087
01:53:09,304 --> 01:53:10,584
Well, say something.

1088
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,624
I'm not gonna say something.

1089
01:53:18,424 --> 01:53:19,664
You can come here.

1090
01:53:21,584 --> 01:53:22,864
Please.

1091
01:53:34,784 --> 01:53:36,944
If I don't even make it.

1092
01:53:45,144 --> 01:53:47,624
Attention Tributes. Attention!

1093
01:53:47,664 --> 01:53:49,424
Commencing Insuberance.

1094
01:53:49,464 --> 01:53:52,464
There will be a feast
tomorrow at the Curnocopia.

1095
01:53:52,784 --> 01:53:55,464
This will be no ordinary occasion.

1096
01:53:55,504 --> 01:53:57,664
Each of you needs something.

1097
01:53:57,704 --> 01:53:59,184
Desperately.

1098
01:53:59,544 --> 01:54:01,704
And we planned to be...

1099
01:54:02,184 --> 01:54:03,504
...generous hosts.

1100
01:54:03,744 --> 01:54:04,984
You rather sit.

1101
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,544
That we needed and you can't walk.

1102
01:54:08,584 --> 01:54:09,944
Promise me, you'll not gonna
risk your life for me.

1103
01:54:09,944 --> 01:54:11,344
I'm not gonna let you.

1104
01:54:11,544 --> 01:54:12,824
You would do it for me.

1105
01:54:13,664 --> 01:54:14,904
Wouldn't you?

1106
01:54:16,464 --> 01:54:17,784
Why are you doing this?

1107
01:54:38,944 --> 01:54:40,064
Peeta!

1108
01:54:40,064 --> 01:54:41,304
Please.

1109
01:54:42,064 --> 01:54:43,304
Stay.

1110
01:54:48,344 --> 01:54:49,584
Okay.

1111
01:54:50,624 --> 01:54:52,104
I'll stay.

1112
01:56:47,024 --> 01:56:48,304
No!

1113
01:56:53,784 --> 01:56:55,384
Where's lover boy?

1114
01:56:58,544 --> 01:57:00,544
Oh I see.

1115
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,344
You're gonna help him right?

1116
01:57:02,984 --> 01:57:04,223
That's sweet.

1117
01:57:04,423 --> 01:57:07,703
Now, it's too bad you couldn't
help your little friend.

1118
01:57:08,103 --> 01:57:10,983
That little girl...
what was her name again?

1119
01:57:11,503 --> 01:57:12,743
Rue?

1120
01:57:14,783 --> 01:57:17,023
Yeah. Well we killed her.

1121
01:57:17,823 --> 01:57:19,263
And now...

1122
01:57:19,743 --> 01:57:21,463
We're gonna kill you...

1123
01:57:26,983 --> 01:57:28,263
You kill her?

1124
01:57:28,263 --> 01:57:29,503
No!

1125
01:57:29,703 --> 01:57:31,743
Cato!

1126
01:57:31,783 --> 01:57:33,023
Shout her name!

1127
01:57:43,183 --> 01:57:44,983
Just this time twelve.

1128
01:57:45,823 --> 01:57:47,063
For Rue!

1129
01:58:02,743 --> 01:58:04,143
Peeta!

1130
01:58:04,183 --> 01:58:05,503
I got it.

1131
01:58:05,543 --> 01:58:06,983
I got the medicine.

1132
01:58:06,983 --> 01:58:08,343
What happened to you?

1133
01:58:08,383 --> 01:58:10,103
No, I'm not. What happened?

1134
01:58:10,223 --> 01:58:12,303
The girl from two, she threw a knife.
I'm okay.

1135
01:58:12,343 --> 01:58:14,263
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you aren't gonna go.

1136
01:58:14,303 --> 01:58:15,543
You got worse.

1137
01:58:22,463 --> 01:58:24,423
You get some of that too.

1138
01:58:24,463 --> 01:58:25,703
I'm okay.

1139
01:58:28,583 --> 01:58:29,823
That feels better.

1140
01:58:31,823 --> 01:58:32,943
Okay.

1141
01:58:32,943 --> 01:58:34,183
Are you?

1142
01:58:34,463 --> 01:58:35,223
I'm okay.

1143
01:58:35,223 --> 01:58:36,543
No, come on. You need it too.

1144
01:58:37,303 --> 01:58:38,543
Come on.

1145
01:59:41,743 --> 01:59:42,983
Oh.

1146
01:59:43,303 --> 01:59:44,543
You're so much better.

1147
01:59:47,223 --> 01:59:48,783
Oh my God, Peeta.

1148
01:59:49,783 --> 01:59:51,623
I couldn't feel anything.

1149
01:59:52,863 --> 01:59:54,143
We could go home.

1150
01:59:55,383 --> 01:59:57,143
We could. With all the team left.

1151
01:59:58,623 --> 01:59:59,863
We could go home.

1152
02:00:04,623 --> 02:00:06,423
We know - took off.

1153
02:00:06,623 --> 02:00:08,543
Cate's gonna be by
the Curnocopia.

1154
02:00:08,543 --> 02:00:10,423
He's not gonna go to
places he doesn't know.

1155
02:00:10,623 --> 02:00:12,543
Fox face, she could be anywhere.

1156
02:00:15,663 --> 02:00:18,743
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

1157
02:00:18,903 --> 02:00:20,823
Okay, uh, I'll take the bow.

1158
02:00:22,903 --> 02:00:24,183
I'm just kidding.

1159
02:00:43,503 --> 02:00:44,743
Peeta?

1160
02:00:48,903 --> 02:00:50,143
Peeta?

1161
02:00:53,343 --> 02:00:54,583
Peeta?

1162
02:00:55,543 --> 02:00:56,783
Peeta?

1163
02:00:56,783 --> 02:00:57,863
Are you okay?

1164
02:00:57,863 --> 02:00:59,343
I hear the cannon.

1165
02:00:59,783 --> 02:01:01,543
That's nightlock Peeta!

1166
02:01:01,543 --> 02:01:03,183
You will be dead in a minute.

1167
02:01:03,223 --> 02:01:04,423
I... I didn't know.

1168
02:01:04,423 --> 02:01:05,703
You scare me to death.

1169
02:01:05,903 --> 02:01:07,143
Damn you.

1170
02:01:07,183 --> 02:01:08,423
I'm sorry.

1171
02:01:10,463 --> 02:01:11,703
I'm sorry.

1172
02:01:19,703 --> 02:01:21,703
I don't even knew, she
was following me.

1173
02:01:22,223 --> 02:01:23,463
She's clever.

1174
02:01:23,903 --> 02:01:25,143
Too clever.

1175
02:01:26,583 --> 02:01:27,783
What're you doing?

1176
02:01:27,783 --> 02:01:29,543
Maybe Cato likes berries too?

1177
02:01:35,463 --> 02:01:36,743
What time is it?

1178
02:01:37,143 --> 02:01:38,583
A little afternoon.

1179
02:01:38,623 --> 02:01:39,983
Why is it so dark?

1180
02:01:40,023 --> 02:01:42,103
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1181
02:01:44,983 --> 02:01:45,863
Ready Lusia?

1182
02:01:45,863 --> 02:01:47,223
Oh right here sir!

1183
02:01:48,983 --> 02:01:50,223
That's great.

1184
02:01:51,023 --> 02:01:52,343
Can you put that in the middle?

1185
02:01:52,383 --> 02:01:53,623
Sure.

1186
02:02:01,823 --> 02:02:03,063
That's it.

1187
02:02:04,303 --> 02:02:05,903
That's it. Excellent.

1188
02:02:16,183 --> 02:02:18,063
Did you hear that?

1189
02:02:51,143 --> 02:02:52,423
What was that?

1190
02:02:53,303 --> 02:02:54,583
It's the finale.

1191
02:03:10,543 --> 02:03:11,783
Let's go.

1192
02:05:05,142 --> 02:05:06,382
Here.

1193
02:06:19,022 --> 02:06:20,302
Go on.

1194
02:06:21,142 --> 02:06:22,382
Shoot.

1195
02:06:24,182 --> 02:06:25,942
And we both go down and you'd win.

1196
02:06:29,822 --> 02:06:31,102
Go on.

1197
02:06:32,782 --> 02:06:34,502
Dead anyway.

1198
02:06:39,142 --> 02:06:40,462
I always want a drink.

1199
02:06:43,382 --> 02:06:44,862
Until not so now.

1200
02:06:48,782 --> 02:06:50,462
How's that? Is that what you want?

1201
02:06:50,502 --> 02:06:51,742
Huh!

1202
02:06:53,262 --> 02:06:54,502
No!

1203
02:06:56,582 --> 02:06:58,302
I can still do this.

1204
02:06:59,782 --> 02:07:01,702
I can still do it.

1205
02:07:02,622 --> 02:07:03,982
One more kill.

1206
02:07:06,542 --> 02:07:08,182
It's the only thing I know how to do.

1207
02:07:09,422 --> 02:07:11,942
Bring pride to the district.

1208
02:07:15,502 --> 02:07:16,742
Not that it matters.

1209
02:07:44,462 --> 02:07:45,742
Please...!

1210
02:08:33,142 --> 02:08:35,582
Attention. Attention Tributes.

1211
02:08:35,742 --> 02:08:39,062
There has been a slight rule change.

1212
02:08:39,302 --> 02:08:43,422
The previous provision
allowing for two victors

1213
02:08:43,422 --> 02:08:47,582
from the same district
has been revoked.

1214
02:08:47,622 --> 02:08:52,182
Only one victor maybe crowned.
Goodluck.

1215
02:08:53,102 --> 02:08:56,222
And may the odds be
ever in your favor.

1216
02:09:10,942 --> 02:09:12,182
Go ahead.

1217
02:09:16,062 --> 02:09:17,422
One of us should go home!

1218
02:09:18,942 --> 02:09:21,022
One of us has to die.
They had to have their victor.

1219
02:09:23,222 --> 02:09:24,462
No.

1220
02:09:25,342 --> 02:09:26,582
They don't.

1221
02:09:28,542 --> 02:09:29,822
Why should they?

1222
02:09:30,982 --> 02:09:31,822
No!

1223
02:09:31,822 --> 02:09:32,862
Trust me.

1224
02:09:33,502 --> 02:09:34,742
Trust me.

1225
02:09:53,822 --> 02:09:55,062
Together?

1226
02:09:56,662 --> 02:09:57,942
Together.

1227
02:09:59,182 --> 02:10:00,422
Okay.

1228
02:10:01,262 --> 02:10:02,542
One...

1229
02:10:04,822 --> 02:10:06,102
Two...

1230
02:10:12,142 --> 02:10:13,422
Three...

1231
02:10:15,102 --> 02:10:16,342
Stop!

1232
02:10:17,142 --> 02:10:18,382
Stop!

1233
02:10:21,742 --> 02:10:22,982
Ladies and gentlemen.

1234
02:10:23,982 --> 02:10:25,702
May I present the winners...

1235
02:10:26,222 --> 02:10:29,182
.. of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

1236
02:10:55,862 --> 02:10:57,782
They're not happy with you.

1237
02:10:58,582 --> 02:11:00,102
Why? Because we didn't die?

1238
02:11:01,422 --> 02:11:02,702
Because you showed them all.

1239
02:11:03,702 --> 02:11:04,742
Well..

1240
02:11:04,742 --> 02:11:06,462
I'm sorry it didn't go
the way they planned.

1241
02:11:06,462 --> 02:11:08,142
You know I'm not very
happy with them either.

1242
02:11:08,182 --> 02:11:09,422
Katniss...

1243
02:11:09,582 --> 02:11:10,822
This is serious.

1244
02:11:11,422 --> 02:11:12,822
Not just for you.

1245
02:11:12,822 --> 02:11:14,502
They don't take this things lightly.

1246
02:12:07,901 --> 02:12:11,381
You say you couldn't help yourself.
You're so in love

1247
02:12:11,381 --> 02:12:14,861
with this boy that the dark
have not with the most...

1248
02:12:14,901 --> 02:12:16,581
Unthinkable...

1249
02:12:16,621 --> 02:12:20,741
You rather die... than not
be with him you understand?

1250
02:12:20,781 --> 02:12:22,021
How did you feel?

1251
02:12:22,501 --> 02:12:25,621
When you found him by the river?

1252
02:12:29,901 --> 02:12:32,381
I felt like the happiest
person in the world.

1253
02:12:36,541 --> 02:12:38,461
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1254
02:12:45,061 --> 02:12:47,621
And what about you Peeta?

1255
02:12:48,141 --> 02:12:49,941
Damn, she just saved my life.

1256
02:12:49,941 --> 02:12:51,301
We saved each other.

1257
02:12:52,821 --> 02:12:54,101
Ladies and gentlemen.

1258
02:12:54,661 --> 02:12:59,021
The star cross lovers
of District 12, this

1259
02:12:59,021 --> 02:13:03,341
years victors of the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.

1260
02:13:19,821 --> 02:13:21,061
Congratulations.

1261
02:13:21,421 --> 02:13:22,661
Thank you.

1262
02:13:28,301 --> 02:13:29,661
What a lovely pin.

1263
02:13:30,021 --> 02:13:31,941
Thank you, it's from my district.

1264
02:13:33,341 --> 02:13:35,501
They must be very proud of you.

1265
02:13:48,221 --> 02:13:49,821
So what happens when we get back?

1266
02:13:52,021 --> 02:13:53,261
I don't know.

1267
02:13:54,461 --> 02:13:56,341
I guess I may try to forget.

1268
02:14:00,861 --> 02:14:02,661
I don't wanna forget.

1269
02:14:07,661 --> 02:14:12,661
