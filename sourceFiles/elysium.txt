1
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,308
Max!

2
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,398
Come on!

3
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:30,234
Don't keep the Sisters waiting.

4
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,408
This is Frey.

5
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:41,453
She's new here as well.

6
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,127
Can you read?

7
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,927
It's a giraffe. They were from Africa.

8
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,263
- You can read?
- Yes.

9
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,149
"There are many robot servants,
and they serve you all day.

10
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,445
If you live there,
you never get sick or old."

11
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:17,615
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really?

12
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,116
Yeah, I promise.

13
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,619
Frey and...

14
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,872
...Max...

15
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,333
...forever.

16
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,379
Max, have you been
stealing things again?

17
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:38,719
It breaks my heart. Why do you do this?

18
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,305
So you can save up?

19
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,642
One day buy a ticket up to that place?

20
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,282
That place is not for you, or for me.

21
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,369
But it's not fair, Sister.

22
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,162
Why can't I go there?

23
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,331
Sometimes in life
we don't understand...

24
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,000
...why things are the way they are.

25
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,462
But I know one thing.

26
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,173
I know you are special.

27
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,344
You will do something
very important one day.

28
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,805
Something you were born for.

29
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,183
My little Max.

30
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,940
Off to work, huh?
Gotta get up early to work that line.

31
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,234
Make the world a better place.

32
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,820
That's real funny, I have a job.

33
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,453
Come on. You think I got money?
Do I look like I have money?

34
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,663
Come on.

35
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,749
How about you?
You got a little money?

36
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,918
Come on. What have you got in there?
What have you got?

37
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,337
Oh, wait a minute.

38
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,880
Wait a minute.

39
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:43,177
Oh, it's 5 bucks. Hey, wait a minute,
I got 5 bucks. I'm rich.

40
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,680
I can finally buy my ticket to Elysium.

41
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,432
All right.

42
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:02,112
Please form an orderly queue.
Your bus has arrived.

43
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,330
Leave me alone!

44
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,999
Checked. Move on.

45
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,002
Your bags may be searched.

46
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,842
Good morning, officer.

47
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,139
Extensive criminal history.
Multiple felonies. What's in the bag?

48
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,226
Hair products, mostly.

49
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,645
I'm just fucking with-- Hey, hey, hey.

50
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,231
I'm just going to work.
Nothing's in the fucking bag.

51
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,482
Come on, I--

52
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,651
Misdemeanour: citizen disobedience.

53
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,153
I'm just going to work, man. Come on.

54
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,328
- Checked.
- Nothing in there, is there?

55
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,705
Zero tolerance policy
applies to all citizens.

56
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,124
No shit.

57
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,088
You must report immediately to
your parole officer. Thank you, citizen.

58
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,506
No, thank you.

59
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,354
- Frey, fracture, Bed 2.
- Just let us work, okay? Let us work.

60
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,403
Max?

61
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,449
Frey. I thought you were...

62
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,367
When did you get back?

63
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,036
Been back for a while.
I see things haven't changed.

64
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,081
- No, this wasn't even my fault.
- Of course not.

65
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,293
- Let me have a look. Pretty bad break.
- It isn't pleasant.

66
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,046
So you're a nurse, huh? You did it.

67
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,549
Yeah.

68
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,093
That's great.

69
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,554
You still stealing cars?

70
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,057
No. God, no. I don't do any
of that stupid shit anymore.

71
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,559
I work at Armadyne.

72
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,438
- On the line, working my way up.
- They need you on the third floor.

73
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,731
Be right there.

74
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,900
So, you know, now that you're back--

75
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,069
Just a second, Max. Two seconds.

76
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,655
Dominica. Can you take over here?

77
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,909
Hey, listen. Now, you know,
because you're back and everything--

78
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,744
Max, I'm so sorry. I have to go.

79
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,163
It's good to see you.
Stay out of trouble.

80
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,416
I do.

81
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,547
Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.

82
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,841
Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.

83
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,261
- Out of the way, sir.
- Look, I get it.

84
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,805
I know why you left the neighbourhood.
I understand.

85
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:39,686
If I was as smart as you, I would have
left too. Have dinner with me. Just...

86
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,648
All right. Look, I'll settle for a coffee.

87
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,317
- No.
- Oh, Jesus.

88
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,611
I gotta break my other arm
to get attention?

89
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,613
- Stop. Stop.
- Because I will do that.

90
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,866
My life is complicated, Max.

91
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,995
I just-- I-- I-- I miss you.

92
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,209
- My shift ends at 8 on Wednesday, okay?
- Yeah. All right.

93
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,336
- Coffee.
- Yeah, coffee. Right.

94
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,672
Get out of here.

95
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,718
All parolees must pass
weapons inspection.

96
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,226
Hello.

97
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,812
I'd just like to explain--

98
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:26,191
Max Da Costa. Violation of Penal Code
2219 today at Bus Stop 34B.

99
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,652
Yes, that's exactly what I wanted
to talk about.

100
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,487
See, there was a misunderstanding.

101
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,781
Immediate extension of parole
by eight months.

102
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,826
Wait, what? No, no, no.
I can explain what happened.

103
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,995
I just made a joke, and, you know--

104
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,416
Stop talking. Police officers noted
violent and antisocial behaviour.

105
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,668
We regretfully must extend parole.

106
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,548
Elevation in heart rate detected.
Would you like a pill?

107
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:53,218
No. Thank you.

108
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,304
- I'd like to explain--
- Stop talking.

109
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,849
Personality matrix suggests
a 78.3 percent chance of regression...

110
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,226
...to old behaviour patterns:
Grand theft auto.

111
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,562
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Resisting arrest.

112
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,442
- Would you like to talk to a human?
- No, I am okay, thank you.

113
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,360
Are you being sarcastic and/or abusive?

114
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,695
Negative.

115
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,323
It is a federal offence
to abuse a parole officer.

116
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,490
Understood.

117
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,121
Safety is our priority.

118
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,374
- Hey. Da Costa.
- No weapons detected.

119
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,710
- You're late for your shift.
- I had a thing--

120
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,046
No, you can't work with that.
You're out.

121
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,050
No, no, no. I'm good, man. I can work.
This comes off today. I'm fine.

122
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,384
- You're good?
- I'm good.

123
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,470
Okay. I'm docking you half a day.

124
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,222
- Yeah, all right.
- You're lucky to have this job.

125
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,267
No weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.

126
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:47,230
--the restroom more than once per shift.
Please keep your workstation tidy.

127
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,942
A tidy workstation
is an efficient workstation.

128
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,832
Check it out, man. I think he likes you.

129
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,251
Think he got his face peel today?
He looks good.

130
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,338
Attention. All workers
must reach weekly quotas.

131
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,508
Please report any unsafe activity
to your supervisor.

132
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,094
If we don't have a clear path to upside...

133
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,514
...our investors are going to start
losing a lot of confidence.

134
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,891
What do you think I've been doing
down on Earth?

135
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,602
- You think I enjoy breathing this air?
- No, of course--

136
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,940
I am doing everything possible
to restore profitability to this company.

137
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,983
The company that I built.

138
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,527
Now, if you will excuse me...

139
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,530
...I have to not speak to you people
any longer. Thank you.

140
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,459
Closing 34.

141
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,673
Fire in 34.

142
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,780
Burn her ID!

143
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,337
Let's go. Let's go.
We don't have much time.

144
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,673
We hacked three
transponder codes, Spider.

145
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,383
Okay. Pull them up on-screen.

146
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,427
Codes have been accepted.

147
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,013
Fire up the shuttles!

148
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,974
We are going UP!

149
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,551
- Welcome.
- Hello, madam.

150
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,054
- Take a look at the garden.
- We will. Thank you.

151
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,389
Yes, I understand...

152
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,310
MY, how you've grown!

153
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,813
Are the children here?

154
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,314
Yes, with Dominica.

155
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,858
I have a present for you.

156
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,861
Go and get it with your mother.

157
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,905
It's next to the couch.

158
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,033
Ma'am, would you care
for a refreshment?

159
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,326
Command: Cancel.

160
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,472
Sorry for disturbing you, ma'am.

161
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,933
We have a number of
undocumented ships inbound.

162
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,940
Good afternoon,
Defence Secretary Delacourt.

163
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:21,486
Three undocumented ships
are approaching Elysium airspace.

164
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:25,282
Emergency orders six and seven
are now in effect.

165
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,954
Protocol 22/B-39 in progress.

166
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,503
Attention, incoming vessels.

167
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,133
You have made unauthorized entry
into Elysium airspace.

168
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,178
Return to Earth or we will be forced
to take immediate action.

169
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,223
You are in violation
of Elysium airspace.

170
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,058
The standard warning didn't work.

171
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,438
Fifteen thousand kilometres and closing.

172
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,691
- What do you want us to do, ma'am?
- Activate Kruger.

173
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,236
Ma'am, according to
Executive Order 355...

174
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,739
...we are unauthorized
to use our assets on Earth.

175
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,991
I am authorising you.

176
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,535
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,846
Agent 32 Alpha,
we are sending a packet. Over.

178
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,943
Welcome, Agent Kruger.

179
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,531
Ten thousand kilometres and closing.

180
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,241
Sending coordinates to asset.

181
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,035
Syncing target data.

182
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,705
Shoot them down.

183
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,124
Green light, 21B. Green light.

184
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,256
Missiles away.

185
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:52,262
Two ships destroyed.
Forty-six total casualties.

186
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,930
Impact in five...

187
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,356
- The last missile was a miss.
Ridiculous.

188
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,692
Only one made it.

189
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,864
The ship has breached
our atmosphere.

190
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,464
First undocumented ship
just touched down.

191
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,717
I want everyone coming out
of that vehicle apprehended.

192
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,331
Identification confirmed.

193
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,501
Scanning.

194
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,922
Reconstruction process initiated.

195
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,011
No.

196
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:20,558
We have 32 arrests, 13 casualties
and two illegals still at large, ma'am.

197
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,603
Reconstruction complete.

198
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,244
You are under arrest
under the 68-C Immigration Act.

199
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,833
- All illegals are now in custody, ma'am.
- Yes.

200
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,044
Send them to Deportation.
Get them off this habitat.

201
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:04,227
Secretary Delacourt, please report
to President Patel immediately.

202
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,814
Secretary Delacourt,
report to President Patel.

203
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,591
What up, man?

204
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,217
What happened?

205
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,595
- The police.
- You okay?

206
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,096
Don't worry about it.

207
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,057
Max, I gotta talk to you.
Okay, you know--

208
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,893
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

209
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,271
- You didn't hear what I was gonna say.
- All right. Go ahead. Go ahead.

210
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,566
Okay. You know the house of Los Zetas,
up on the hill?

211
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,320
- Yeah, the one with all the guns.
- Yeah. They have five cars. New ones.

212
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,448
It's gonna be three of us.
Tomorrow at lunch.

213
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,075
- Lunch time. That's the plan?
- Yeah.

214
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,286
- Jesus Christ.
- What? You have a better plan?

215
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:07,373
Yeah. We just take one guy,
go before the sun comes up.

216
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,960
You take the two fastest cars,
torch the batteries on the other one so--

217
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,795
Fuck you, fuck you.

218
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,591
I got you. Please, man, you're the best.
Give me one year.

219
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,843
- Just one year.
- I'm not going back to prison.

220
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,511
One year, please.

221
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,640
Look at you. You used to be a legend,
and now what?

222
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,695
The time is 5:50 a.m.

223
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,584
No weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.

224
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,425
Closing 34.

225
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,905
Hey. You're holding up the line.

226
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,907
No. No, no. I got a jam.

227
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:26,369
Attention. Workers may not visit
the restroom more than once per shift.

228
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,539
- What have you done, Da Costa?
- No, I'm just trying to reset.

229
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,041
Let me look. Let me look.

230
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,086
- The pallet's pinched.
- Yeah, it moved.

231
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,463
- Just go in there.
- No. I mean...

232
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,259
Look, either you go in there right now
or I'll find someone who will...

233
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,678
-...and you can clean out your locker.
- Come on.

234
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,681
No. That's the deal, okay? In you go.

235
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,895
Let's go, people. Back to work.

236
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,482
Fuck.

237
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,924
No, no. No, no, no!

238
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,302
No. No, no! No, stop. No, no!

239
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,720
Hey! Hey! Hey!

240
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:38,941
Hey.

241
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,324
Hey, come on, you guys.

242
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,119
It's too late. It's too late, come on.

243
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:51,662
Come on.

244
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,040
Extraction!

245
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,114
They started the fight, Sister.

246
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,367
I just want to live there.

247
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,205
You see how beautiful it looks to us
from here?

248
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,999
Yes.

249
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,169
Well...

250
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,714
Now look how beautiful we look
from there.

251
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,301
Keep it.

252
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,846
This is yours now.

253
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,350
To never forget about
where you come from.

254
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,703
What happened?

255
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,373
You have been exposed
to a lethal dose of radiation.

256
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,376
You will experience
catastrophic organ failure.

257
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,463
In five days' time, you will die.

258
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,767
What is going on?
Why has production stopped?

259
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,354
- He's been exposed.
- Don't breathe on me. Cover your mouth.

260
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,564
I'm sorry, sir.

261
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,910
Does his skin fall off or something?

262
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,496
I don't want to replace the bedding.
Get him out.

263
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,081
- Yes, sir.
- Great. Thank you.

264
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,585
Mr. Carlyle,
your shuttle is ready for departure.

265
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,552
Please sign this to receive medication.

266
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:24,899
Miporol, extremely potent, will keep you
functioning normally until your death.

267
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:30,279
Please take one pill with each meal.
Thank you for your service.

268
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:46,963
At 1500 hours yesterday, you shot down
two shuttles, killing 46 civilians.

269
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,632
Your mandate is to deal
with illegals quietly.

270
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,384
I am aware of that.

271
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,636
And then there's the use of this...

272
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,807
...agent, a Mr. M. Kruger.

273
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:02,478
Fifteen human rights violations.
Rapes. Kidnappings. Torture.

274
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,648
The man's been diagnosed
with serious psychological issues.

275
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,817
We made it explicitly clear to you...

276
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,361
...that we are no longer using
sleeper agents.

277
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,322
Tell me something, President Patel.

278
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,741
Do you have children?

279
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,662
I am not the one being reviewed here.

280
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,374
Then I will assume you do not.

281
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:28,296
Perhaps if you did have children,
then you would behave in a manner...

282
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:32,216
...that is more conducive
to the longevity of this habitat.

283
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:37,096
I understand that it is not the fashion
to think and to act as I do.

284
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,016
I understand that perfectly.

285
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,184
But when they come for your house...

286
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,687
...for the house you built
for your children...

287
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,856
...and your children's children...

288
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:52,612
...it won't be PR and campaign promises
that keep them out. It will be me.

289
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,531
I've heard enough.
This is your final warning.

290
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:59,535
Any further unauthorized actions,
and you will be removed from office.

291
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:03,956
And let's discharge
this Agent Kruger permanently.

292
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,625
All in favour?

293
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,045
Good. Effective immediately.

294
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,858
You want some beer?

295
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,745
You have been discharged from CCB.

296
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,790
Please return all weapons
to the local embassy.

297
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,586
Fuck your politics, man! Fuck you!

298
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,061
Max.

299
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,441
Max.

300
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,488
What happened? Jesus.
Let me help you.

301
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:18,864
Let's go in, come on.

302
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,285
Max, what happened? Jesus.

303
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,912
Max. What happened?

304
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,665
- I shouldn't have gone in, man.
- Go in where?

305
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,418
Jesus.

306
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,465
I took a full dose, man.

307
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,884
I got a full dose.

308
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,264
You're gonna be okay. Let me help.

309
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,517
You're gonna be okay, Max.

310
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,895
They gave me Miporol, man.

311
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,356
They gave me fucking...

312
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,651
...Miporol.

313
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,281
Five fucking days, man.
I only got five days.

314
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,450
You have to take this.

315
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:08,080
- They can fix this shit on Elysium, man.
- I know.

316
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,040
I'm gonna go see Spider.

317
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,169
Max. Max, take the pill.

318
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,675
There you go.

319
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,511
To see Spider, you need money.

320
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,891
I'll give you everything I have,
but it's not enough for a ticket.

321
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,519
He's gonna give me a ticket.

322
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,856
He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.

323
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,612
Frey, we've done everything we could
to help your daughter.

324
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,741
I met with the board today and they
recommend we send her home with you.

325
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,202
How can I work here
and leave her at home?

326
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,454
It can happen any minute, Dr. Faizel.

327
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:52,041
I know. If she has another seizure,
of course bring her back to the ward.

328
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,542
Of course.

329
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,419
But until then, she's discharged.

330
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:59,215
This isn't Elysium.
We can't just heal her.

331
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,759
Max.

332
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,136
It's been a while, my brother.

333
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,472
How's life at the factory?

334
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,308
I need to ask you a favour.

335
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,352
What? I can't hear you. What?

336
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,438
I need a ticket up there.

337
00:30:57,398 --> 00:31:00,276
- And an ID.
- Oh, yeah.

338
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,821
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

339
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,449
Absolutely.
Do you prefer aisle or window?

340
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,036
I'm being fucking serious, man.

341
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,498
Listen. I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna come back and work for you.

342
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,628
Anything you need, man.
I'll fucking pay it back.

343
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,297
You know what?

344
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,552
This is priceless.

345
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:32,057
This is priceless.

346
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,643
Yeah. Let me ask you a question.

347
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,273
Do you have any idea
how many idiots come in here...

348
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,817
...saying the same kind of bullshit?

349
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:45,529
I got little kids coming in here
every day.

350
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,115
Max, if I were you...

351
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,160
...I'd get the fuck out of here right now.

352
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,496
Max, don't. Hey, Max, don't.

353
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,664
I did three years for you.

354
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,334
After everything I did for you,
you'll get me up there.

355
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,502
- Can you feel this?
- Go ahead and shoot.

356
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,381
I got so much radiation in my body,
you're probably getting sick yourself.

357
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,718
- You're really dying?
- I'm fucking dying, motherfucker.

358
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:12,056
See this? It's over. Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!

359
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,308
Put the gun down! Get out of here!

360
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,852
Okay?

361
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:21,065
Listen. I've been looking for someone
to take a job for me.

362
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,027
But no one here had the balls!

363
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,364
You said you'd do anything, right?

364
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,532
Max.

365
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,627
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

366
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,885
All right, here we go.

367
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,308
This...

368
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,895
...my friend...

369
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,983
This can be your ticket up there.

370
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:09,989
One last job for me,
you earn your way up.

371
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:15,869
- What is it?
- Take an Elysian asshole, right?

372
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,579
A billionaire.

373
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,541
He's down on Earth for some business.

374
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:23,669
He's here for whatever. We hijack him.

375
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,587
- Fuck that.
- Okay, relax.

376
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,091
It gets, like, much worse.

377
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,678
Forget his watch. Forget his ride.
Forget all that shit.

378
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:36,265
This is what you take.

379
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,937
Organic information,
right out of his head.

380
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:46,900
Now, I'm talking about bank codes,
passwords, log-in data.

381
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,445
Access to billions.

382
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,115
All you have to do
is plug into his brain...

383
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:56,076
...download the data into yours
with this baby...

384
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,203
...and bring it to me.

385
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,705
This is crazy, Max. Come on.

386
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:05,335
Once we verify the data, I'll give you
a one-way ride, all expenses paid.

387
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,297
Even throw in some snacks
and a drink.

388
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:12,593
All you have to do is walk
into a house and use the med bay...

389
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,802
...and you're cured.

390
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,431
Sandro will do the surgery.
You know him?

391
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,683
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

392
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,143
I'm good.

393
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:26,398
Actually, you seem
all weak and fucked up.

394
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,652
So you know what? I'll have them...

395
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:34,740
This is crazy. Let's get out of here,
please. Listen to me.

396
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,868
- What the fuck am I gonna do?
- I'll have them instal...

397
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,122
...this. A third-generation exo-suit.

398
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,335
We hook this into your nervous system,
it'll make you as strong as a droid.

399
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,670
You're already under the knife, right?

400
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,589
Let's get out of here. Please.

401
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,008
I want a four-man team, but I pick them.

402
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,844
I'm sending my own data wrangler.

403
00:34:56,011 --> 00:35:00,057
- Brain-to-brain data is real tough.
- Okay.

404
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,769
But I'm taking Julio.
He gets a ticket up there, same as me.

405
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,147
Yeah, sure.
Okay. I'll go get the boys ready.

406
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,024
Wait.

407
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,528
It's gotta be John Carlyle.

408
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:17,282
The CEO of Armadyne Carlyle?

409
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:20,035
That's the mark.

410
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,336
Secretary Delacourt,
Mr. Carlyle has arrived.

411
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:34,925
You are here to persuade me
to renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?

412
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,468
Astute as always.

413
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,429
Come with me.

414
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,815
I'm not interested in your little ideas.

415
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,110
I'm interested in something
much larger.

416
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,612
This habitat is dying.

417
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,240
There is a political sickness
inside of it.

418
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,160
A tumour that needs to be removed.

419
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,830
You and your company
are in need of revenue...

420
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,582
...that is drying up.

421
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,252
So you built the torus.

422
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:15,799
Can you override the servers
and place a new president in power?

423
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,762
A coup?

424
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,599
Are you suggesting a coup?

425
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,976
Is it possible?

426
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:31,732
I could write a reboot sequence
and shut down the entire system.

427
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,609
And at that point...

428
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,446
...you could encode
a new president, yes.

429
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,489
Then that is what you will do.

430
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,785
And you will have your contract secured
for the next 200 years.

431
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,038
Missile defence batteries, droids.

432
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,166
Everything we need
to protect our liberty.

433
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:54,338
All guaranteed, of course,
by your new president.

434
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,765
You have work to do, Mr. Carlyle.

435
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,811
This is the guy.

436
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,815
- This is the guy?
- This is him.

437
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,567
Sit down.

438
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,446
We're gonna cut you a good one.

439
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,532
Play nice, Sandro. Play nice.

440
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,118
Let's get him an ID first.

441
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,829
Get the chief
one of them identification codes.

442
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,248
Get that ready.

443
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:31,083
Arm up.

444
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:41,510
That'll merge with the DNA
and you'll fit in like you were born there.

445
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,764
Now it's time for the real fun.

446
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,022
Okay. What we got?

447
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:06,576
Hey, man.

448
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:11,039
Yo. Is this gonna hurt?

449
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,461
Yeah, bitch, it's gonna hurt.
It's gonna hurt good.

450
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,881
When we're done with you,
you're gonna be a favela ninja.

451
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,969
Marianna, hey,
bring down the bone saw.

452
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,517
- Bring the bone saw!
- This ain't gonna kill me.

453
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,687
You're gonna be all right, my brother.

454
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,648
Max.

455
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,900
I'm here.

456
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,739
We got this, man. We got this.

457
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,909
Yeah.

458
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,964
Hey!

459
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,383
He's awake!

460
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,304
You made it, huh? Surprise.

461
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,019
You can still jack off.

462
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,648
- How's everything going?
- He's ready to kick ass.

463
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:07,447
What the fuck did you do to me?

464
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,159
Gave you a way out.

465
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,462
Damn.

466
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:10,635
What's up, partner? How's that suit
working out for you, man?

467
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:14,598
That shit is tight.

468
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,391
Show me.

469
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,148
Hold that.

470
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,985
What's this, a family heirloom?

471
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:28,612
Wait for it.

472
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:34,326
Air-bursting ammunition.
Designate your enemy...

473
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:38,079
...and any round you fire will explode
around them, five-metre kill radius.

474
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,248
And...

475
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,669
...synced detonation rounds
for this bad boy.

476
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,505
That'll work.

477
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,173
Move out.

478
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,684
Sir?

479
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,853
Shuttle is ready.

480
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,374
Do you read me?

481
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,838
Here's the deal.

482
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,132
We'll wait outside the factory
until we see his shuttle leave.

483
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:35,053
One of you puts an explosive round in it,
goes to the crash site, gets the data.

484
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:37,806
Okay. Copy that.

485
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,313
Camera's live, boys.
You getting this, Spider?

486
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,315
I got it. Let's go. Let's play ball.

487
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:50,652
- Move out of the way.
- Coming through.

488
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,661
- You nervous?
- No.

489
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:00,996
No?

490
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,375
I'm shitting my pants.

491
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,341
- We're not gonna fucking die here.
- Yeah.

492
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,239
GO, go:

493
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:55,467
Acceleration to supersonic speeds
in 15 seconds.

494
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,021
Come on, come OH, come on.

495
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,740
Critical engine failure.

496
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:24,120
Ma'am, we have an Elysian citizen
on Earth in danger.

497
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,747
Data coming up now.

498
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,585
Citizen identified. John Carlyle.
N8321P...

499
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,547
I see you, motherfucker.

500
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,261
I have a situation here.

501
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,180
Kruger, do you read me?

502
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:45,975
Miss Delacourt,
how lovely to hear your voice.

503
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:49,396
There is a citizen carrying
sensitive brain data out of the city.

504
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,440
- Some thieves are trying to hijack it.
-What's in it?

505
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,775
That's classified.

506
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:56,778
You don't call
a recently deactivated agent...

507
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,698
...to retrieve classified
fucking information, man.

508
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,991
The government doesn't know
about this, do they?

509
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,619
I can ask for whatever I want, can't I?

510
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,709
Please brace for impact.

511
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,136
Please remain calm.
You have sustained zero injuries.

512
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,804
Oh, that's a real comfort.

513
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:31,771
I got one condition.
I do this, I get reinstated.

514
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:36,359
Fine. I've recommissioned
two of your preferred agents...

515
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,361
...completely confidentially, of course.

516
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,864
They should be at your position
any second.

517
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,824
Send me the mission data.

518
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,427
Let's go, guys. Out of the cars.

519
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:13,605
Droids, there appears to be some type
of wheeled vehicle with one...

520
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,025
Two occupants...

521
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,111
...and they are armed
and I'd like them dead.

522
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,866
Droid!

523
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,791
It's jammed! It's jammed!

524
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:40,256
- No!
- Identified. Max Da Costa.

525
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:45,762
Federal parole number 61492-8-557.

526
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:47,222
Come on.

527
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,397
It's jammed, man!

528
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,150
Got it.

529
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,655
He's reloading!

530
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,051
- You all right?
- We gotta go faster. I got the door.

531
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,220
Go, go! I got you covered!

532
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,597
GO, go!

533
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,443
Don't fucking move.

534
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,450
- Bring it!
- There's another one.

535
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,872
Die, motherfucker!

536
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,127
Don't hit the mark!

537
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:54,641
No, no, no! No, no!
He got hit, he got hit!

538
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:58,102
Citizen has sustained
a cardiothoracic trauma.

539
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,938
Blood pressure is dropping.

540
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,190
It's not in the head. It's in the chest.

541
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,360
We're fucking good, man.
Hold his head. Hold his head.

542
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,196
Plug this into you.
Come on, get that shit in.

543
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,741
- Come on, baby.
-It's in.

544
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,576
- Yes.
- Is it working?

545
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:15,203
Yeah, yeah, we're syncing.

546
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,415
You have no idea what you're doing.

547
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,379
One minute to target, sir.

548
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:31,094
All right. All right, we're synced.
Come on, baby, here we go.

549
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,223
It's gonna work. We got it.
It's gonna work.

550
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,309
It's a data heist, ma'am.
They're downloading now.

551
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,816
Guys, we got incoming.

552
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:46,985
Oh, fuck me.

553
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,780
Come on, guys, hurry up.

554
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,740
That's a Raven. That's military.

555
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,326
That's all right, we got this.
Ninety-seven, 98.

556
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,370
- Hurry up! They're coming!
- Almost there.

557
00:49:57,537 --> 00:50:00,581
Ninety-nine! Ding, here we go!

558
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,837
Oh, shit. Something must be corrupted.

559
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,173
- What the fuck? What does that mean?
- Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

560
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,550
I can't read the data.

561
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,469
- It's scrambled. I can't read the data.
- What?

562
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:16,931
Come on, guys, we gotta move!

563
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:19,600
- What the fuck does "scrambled" mean?
- Fuck this.

564
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,687
No, no, no. We have to run it again!
Run it another time, man!

565
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,606
Fucking get off me, man.
I'm fucking bailing.

566
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,775
Please run it again.

567
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,611
- I can't. Get the fuck off me.
- Let's get out of here.

568
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,447
Where the fuck
are you going, Sandro?

569
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,619
- Let's get out of here!
- Goddamn it!

570
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,296
Come on, Max.

571
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:50,298
Get out of there! Let's go!

572
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:54,010
We gotta go! Come on, Max. Come on.

573
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:58,306
Hey, boss. We got a runner.

574
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,641
Locked on.

575
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,477
Fire!

576
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:15,782
Shit, man.

577
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,249
That's what I'm talking about!

578
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,834
Fuck, man!

579
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,878
Targets moving south-southwest.

580
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:31,380
Move, Max. It's coming.

581
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:38,179
We got another one.

582
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,597
Okay.

583
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:43,184
This is wrong. This is all wrong, man.

584
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,486
Going into a holding pattern, sir.

585
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,072
Where do you think you're going?

586
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,450
Come on!

587
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,440
Fuck! Fucker!

588
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:18,613
Come on.

589
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:20,573
No!

590
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,530
No. No.

591
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:03,574
No.

592
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,409
Get up!

593
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,585
Get up!

594
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:24,595
No!

595
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:46,534
We've got one assailant
leaving on foot, ma'am.

596
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,744
They have the data. Repeat:

597
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,915
The thieves have the data.
Apprehend the target at all costs.

598
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:55,209
Do not damage his brain.

599
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:58,045
Let's go! We got a runner, boys!

600
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:07,138
Citizen has suffered catastrophic
blood loss leading to cardiac arrest.

601
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:10,975
Time of death: 17:45.

602
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:58,689
Come on, where are you hiding?
What's that?

603
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,785
It looks like a herd of pigs, boss.

604
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,121
Fuck you, man! Find him!

605
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,957
Take us back to the crash site.
See what they left behind.

606
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,125
Roger that.

607
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,999
Hey, boss.
I think you'd better come look at this.

608
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,628
This is a record of what we picked up...

609
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,256
...in transfer between Carlyle
and the criminal, sir.

610
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,259
That's why she wants it so badly.

611
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:11,846
He's got the keys to the kingdom
in his fucking head.

612
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,807
Now we just need to find him.

613
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,727
I'm gonna let the girls out.

614
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,030
Searching grids three through 11.

615
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,410
I'm authorising a full containment order.

616
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:37,037
Issue a no-fly zone for Los Angeles.

617
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,291
- All of Los Angeles?
- The murderer is still out there.

618
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,878
Until we apprehend him,
no one leaves the surface of that city.

619
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,054
What the...?

620
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,894
Max.

621
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,772
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

622
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,774
We can go home.

623
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:49,235
Am I better?

624
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:54,240
I'm gonna get the car, okay?

625
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,452
Be right back.

626
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,626
Frey...

627
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,963
Max.

628
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,510
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

629
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,348
- Shit. Let me get the medics.
- No.No.

630
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,559
I can't go in there.

631
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,478
- Max, listen to me. You need a doctor.
- I can't go in there.

632
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,772
People are looking for me.
They'll kill me.

633
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:28,941
- I came for you. I need your help.
- Max.

634
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:31,652
You've got to go through the system
to get treatment.

635
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:35,906
Please help me. I don't wanna die.

636
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,868
Max.

637
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,870
Max.

638
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:45,165
Stay awake.

639
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,759
I wanna see the man.

640
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,888
Mommy's gonna help him, okay?
Try and sleep.

641
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,686
Don't sleep.

642
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:11,609
Come on.

643
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,111
Max, you can do it, come on.

644
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:17,615
Stay awake.

645
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:18,782
Let's turn you over.

646
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,707
Max. Max, wait.

647
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:13,796
Thank you.

648
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,255
Who did this to you?

649
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:18,550
Oh, no, I got...
I got hurt at work, and I had to...

650
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:23,722
I had to take a job from Spider
to try to get up there and get healed.

651
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,265
It went bad.

652
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,476
- I'm in trouble.
- Mommy?

653
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:33,190
Hey, sweetie. Come here.

654
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,614
Who's that man?

655
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:45,452
His name is Max. Mommy knew him
when he was your age.

656
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:47,121
This is Matilda.

657
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,623
Hi.

658
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:54,586
You can go watch cartoons, okay?
I'll be right there.

659
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,632
I didn't-- I didn't know you had...

660
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:01,969
- I'm so sorry. I need to go.
- Wait, Max. Wait.

661
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:04,346
- Don't leave. Wait.
- I shouldn't have come here.

662
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:08,642
Max. She's dying.
She's in the final stages of leukaemia.

663
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:11,478
I told you my life was complicated.

664
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:15,941
I need you to help me.
I have no idea how to do this.

665
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,152
- How to do what?
- Get her to Elysium.

666
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,238
- I can't help her. I would...
- Max.

667
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:25,159
- I would if I could.
- What about this? Fake citizenship.

668
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,328
If you took her there,
could you heal her with this?

669
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:31,331
It doesn't work that way.
This is coded to me.

670
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,000
It's locked to my DNA.

671
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,002
These people
who are looking for me--

672
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:37,713
You don't understand
who these people are.

673
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,174
If they find me here,
they will kill all of us.

674
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,343
The only thing I can do to help you
is leave, I promise you.

675
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,847
- She's all I have.
- I'm sorry.

676
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:54,688
You have bandages.

677
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:58,776
Yeah, I got bandages.

678
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,784
- What are you doing?
- I don't want you to be sick.

679
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,370
- Do you wanna hear a story?
-No--

680
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:14,708
There once was a meerkat
who lived in the jungle.

681
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,878
He was hungry, but he was small.

682
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:23,133
So small. And the other big animals
had all the food...

683
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,719
...because they could reach the fruits.

684
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:28,889
So he made friends
with a hippopotamus to--

685
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:30,307
Okay, stop.

686
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,603
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.

687
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:40,901
Yes, it does, because he can stand
on the hippopotamus's back...

688
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:44,321
...to get all the fruits that he wants.

689
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,114
What's in it for the hippo?

690
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,408
The hippo wants a friend.

691
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,927
I'm sorry.

692
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:46,300
Hey, boss.

693
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,637
I think we got him.

694
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:57,978
Land this fucking craft.

695
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:27,007
- Mommy, is everything okay?
-It's okay, sweetie.

696
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,809
Clear.

697
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:41,730
It's okay, sweetie.

698
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,650
Afternoon.

699
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,194
Sorry to come bursting into your home.

700
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:50,864
I didn't mean to traumatize
your young daughter.

701
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:53,533
Me and the boys here...

702
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,619
...we're looking
for a young gentleman...

703
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:58,080
...who was in this very house
a moment ago.

704
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,416
We're hoping you can tell us
where he went.

705
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:05,629
No. I...

706
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,049
I don't know where he is.

707
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:14,471
I don't believe in committing violent acts
in front of kids...

708
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,057
...so I just need you to
close your eyes, sweetheart.

709
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,184
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

710
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,145
I really need you to tell me.

711
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,982
Where is he? You remember now?

712
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,566
- Mommy.
- Close your eyes.

713
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,194
Keep your fucking eyes closed.
Keep your eyes closed.

714
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:30,904
Please, I don't know where he is.

715
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:34,950
He was wounded.
I helped him and he left.

716
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:36,410
Please.

717
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,746
Do you fucking hate that?
No loyalty nowadays, eh?

718
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,126
It's okay, sweetie.

719
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:48,088
And what's this here? This a hospital
you running here? What's going on?

720
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:51,174
- She's sick.
- She's sick?

721
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,343
She's sick? Let me have a look at her.

722
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:57,764
- Don't touch her.
- See that? Protective instinct there, eh?

723
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,182
I said don't touch her!

724
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,184
I'm trying to get a word with your child.

725
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,437
If you give me a second.
Bring her. Come.

726
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,148
- Where are you taking us?
- I've got something you want.

727
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,399
-It's okay.
- Mommy.

728
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,276
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

729
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,694
Sit down. Shut up.

730
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:27,002
Stop.

731
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,130
Hey, hey, he)'-

732
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:33,133
No, no, no.
Don't shoot him, don't shoot him.

733
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,177
Put the guns down. Let him come.

734
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,972
- You got something, didn't you?
- What?

735
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,809
That's why they shut down the sky.
Come on. What is it? Wire transfers?

736
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,103
Corporate intel?
You gotta have something big.

737
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,563
I fucking got nothing, man.

738
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,150
It all got scrambled. Julio is dead.
You owe me.

739
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:52,319
- Let's go fucking now!
- We can't!

740
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:54,738
The flight system is jammed!

741
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:56,656
Nobody is going up there.

742
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,329
- Till when?
- Till I don't fucking know.

743
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:06,374
- I gotta get up there, man.
- Oh, everyone needs to get up there.

744
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:09,044
My guys are working to see
if we have a hope in hell...

745
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:12,339
...which I personally think we do not,
of ever getting back online.

746
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:15,175
But for now...

747
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:18,011
...let's just take a look
at that head of yours.

748
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:21,348
- Get away from me, man.
- Just look at me.

749
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:27,354
If they shut down the whole fucking sky
for what's in your head...

750
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:32,192
...maybe the key to opening it
could be in there too, right?

751
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:35,237
Come on.

752
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,743
All right.

753
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:54,714
They will hunt you
to the edge of the Earth for this.

754
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,299
What is it?

755
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,052
It's a reboot programme for Elysium.

756
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:03,932
Whoever has this has the power
to override their whole system.

757
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,810
Open the borders.

758
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:10,981
Make everyone a citizen of Elysium.

759
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:17,362
This can save your life.

760
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,740
We can save everyone.

761
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,075
When can I go?

762
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,828
They're trying to hack through
the signal jam, but soon.

763
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:29,416
- Don't bullshit me. When can we go?
- I don't know. Five days.

764
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:32,085
Fuck you. I don't have five days.

765
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:34,171
- I got hours.
- My guys are working on it.

766
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:37,674
You're always working on it.
You can't get me up there.

767
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,927
Why do you even try sending people up?
They just get shot down.

768
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,597
Not with what's in your head!
That's what I'm talking about.

769
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:47,017
We would control the system here.
We would be in charge.

770
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:49,603
We can change the course
of fucking history here.

771
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,104
Back up, then.

772
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:55,525
What I have in my head
is worth a lot to them, right?

773
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,528
Don't do this.

774
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:02,365
If that falls into the wrong hands,
they could shut us out for good.

775
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,452
Listen, man,
I'm going up there right now.

776
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:10,123
Now, if you can find me and I'm healed,
you can have all of this.

777
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,210
- But I'm not fucking dying.
- This is wrong, Max. Don't do this.

778
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,556
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.

779
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,683
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.

780
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:37,025
It's okay. It's okay.

781
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,906
I always wanted a wife.

782
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:49,204
I just couldn't quite settle down,
you know.

783
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:52,123
Too much temptation.

784
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,128
But you...

785
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,636
You make me ready to settle down.

786
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:07,264
You really make me wanna
settle down, baby.

787
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:21,278
Holy shit, sir.

788
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,072
- You better take a look at this.
- What? What is it?

789
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,533
Check this fucking oke.

790
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:30,787
Turn us around.

791
01:11:56,021 --> 01:11:57,480
-Drakey?
-Yes?

792
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,940
Open the door.

793
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:12,746
Stop right there!

794
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:17,250
You're gonna do exactly what I say
or I'm gonna blow my fucking head off!

795
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,795
- You understand?
- Yeah.

796
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,256
You can have everything in my head!

797
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,760
Just take me up there
and get me in a med bay!

798
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:29,429
What I have is very valuable!

799
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:31,806
We can fix you up.

800
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,060
Put you in a med bay,
sort all this kak up.

801
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:39,022
Let's go. We'll take you up there.

802
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:42,192
Weather's nice. Air's nice and clean.

803
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:44,652
Lekker, you'll dig it.

804
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:47,530
Don't you fucking try anything.

805
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:51,659
Step aboard. Come meet the boys.
Come, boet.

806
01:12:52,494 --> 01:12:54,287
Don't be shy. They won't bite.

807
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:56,998
Let me introduce you. This is Drakey.

808
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,501
- This is Max.
- How is it, butch?

809
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,628
Close up, Drakey.

810
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:03,588
Copy that.

811
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:11,971
Crowe, let's go.

812
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:19,062
Yes, ma'am.
We apprehended the subject.

813
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:21,231
Open the skies, we're coming home.

814
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:23,483
I'll expect you in 19 minutes.

815
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,165
Cancel the no-fly zone.

816
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:41,000
Yes, ma'am.

817
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,462
What?

818
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,632
What is that? What is that?
Are we back?

819
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:51,177
- What the fuck is that? Are we back?
- We're back online, Spider.

820
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:04,566
Frey.

821
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:08,778
I'm sorry. I'm gonna make this right.

822
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,041
We've got him.

823
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,418
All right. Where is he?

824
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:27,088
He's leaving Earth,
heading to Elysium.

825
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:37,515
Manuel, Rico.
Get weapons. Let's get up there.

826
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,317
Echo Leader 234
requesting landing in Sector 22.

827
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:50,570
Roger that, Echo Leader M-234.
You are cleared for entry.

828
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:49,337
I see you got the G-19.

829
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:51,965
Hey, back the fuck up.
Back the fuck up.

830
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,341
- Or what?
- I'll let it go.

831
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:54,968
What you gonna do, huh?

832
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,470
I want what's in your head, boykie.

833
01:15:58,388 --> 01:15:59,889
Come on. Come on.

834
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,849
Legs! Grab his legs!

835
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,026
Grab the grenade!

836
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,695
Hold on!

837
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,535
Get down!

838
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,369
- What do you want us to do?
- I want everyone...

839
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:06,497
...coming out of that vehicle
apprehended by Homeland Security.

840
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:10,043
Evacuate everyone under Level 5
clearance out of the building now.

841
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:18,885
Matilda!

842
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:20,595
I warned you of this.

843
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:24,057
An unlicensed vehicle just crashed,
potentially threatening the torus.

844
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:28,353
All because of your inability to act.
Evacuate him.

845
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,732
- Get your hands off of me.
- This is an act of war.

846
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:35,777
That puts the CCB under my control.

847
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,237
Now, if you'd let me do my job...

848
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:41,908
...I'm sure you have
a fundraiser to attend.

849
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,576
Let's go, sir.

850
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,959
Why are you not answering me?

851
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,632
Max.

852
01:17:57,799 --> 01:18:01,969
- Take me out of here, Max!
- Yeah. I'm trying!

853
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,348
Air quality reaching toxic levels.

854
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:12,939
Get me out of here.

855
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:16,526
It is recommended
you exit the craft immediately.

856
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:30,123
- Run!
- Come here, you fucker.

857
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,850
Two illegals heading northeast
in Zone 3.

858
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:00,319
You deal with those two.
I'll handle this poes.

859
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:04,907
Welcome to this spectacular property,
sprawling over...

860
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:18,296
Error.

861
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:22,425
- No.
- No citizen detected.

862
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:29,348
Please. She's sick. Help us.
She's gone into a coma. Please.

863
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:57,710
Shouldn't we remove this thing?

864
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:02,173
Can't, till we get all the data.
It's wired into him neurologically.

865
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,008
The data is intact, yes?

866
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:06,427
Data looks intact.

867
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:08,095
Warning.

868
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,973
We can still pull the data out of him,
which will kill him.

869
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:15,603
Oh, that's fine. How long before you can
download and turn the system online?

870
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,063
Not long, ma'am.

871
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:20,733
Keep everything in a restricted cloud.
Lock down all access.

872
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,068
Starting prep right now.

873
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,573
And get these two out of here.

874
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:29,408
Roger that.

875
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:32,411
Crowe, you wanna go get
the boss's chicks?

876
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,413
Yeah, boet.

877
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:02,942
Give them the runaround.
Keep them busy.

878
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:07,905
Got him.

879
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:09,448
Let's go.

880
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,869
All right, 50 exabytes, buddy.
You ready?

881
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,913
What are you taking out of him?

882
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,292
Hey. What are you doing to him?

883
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,502
What's gonna happen to him? Hey.

884
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,463
Rise and shine.

885
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:26,632
- Get up.
- Max.

886
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:29,218
Max. Max!

887
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:31,137
Max!

888
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,652
Get in there.

889
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:53,326
Away.

890
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:58,581
Boss got fucked up, eh?

891
01:21:58,748 --> 01:22:00,875
Ate that fucking grenade, eh?

892
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:08,049
His brain is fine, but he's gonna
be pissed when he wakes up, eh?

893
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:11,510
Remember the kak that happened
in India when he lost his legs.

894
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:36,619
Kruger.

895
01:22:38,913 --> 01:22:40,748
Hey, boss.

896
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,168
It's Crowe.

897
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:49,256
Where is he?

898
01:22:50,675 --> 01:22:51,842
All right. We're all set.

899
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,178
Okay. Let's re-sedate him.

900
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:58,099
Got the needle prepped.
Here, you wanna grab this and then--

901
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,893
Grab the needle! Grab the needle!
Stick him with it!

902
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:23,582
- Where did they take the girls?
- The armoury.

903
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:27,962
- Where the fuck is that?
- Level three.

904
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,722
Lethal radiation poisoning detected.

905
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:40,850
You require urgent medical attention.

906
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:51,527
You idiot.
Do you realise what you've done?

907
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:56,198
You crashed an unlicensed vehicle
into a suburban area.

908
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:01,454
Your orders were to keep this covert.

909
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,832
Do you even remember
what that means?

910
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,795
Have you completely lost your mind?

911
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,464
You're useless to me.

912
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,467
If the administration realised
what we're doing...

913
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,927
...they'd hang us both for treason.

914
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,974
For God's sake, Kruger,
are you listening to me?

915
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,478
Yes.

916
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,647
Yes, ma'am...

917
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:30,649
...I'm listening.

918
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:37,490
I'm sorry that we crashed the vehicle
and ruined someone's lawn.

919
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:40,242
But nobody is gonna hang us
for treason.

920
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,495
We do the hanging.

921
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:48,542
Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.

922
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,295
Not so chirpy now, eh?

923
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:55,841
It's all right, boys. Elysium is about
to get its first proper president.

924
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:02,890
She needs some medical attention.

925
01:25:09,063 --> 01:25:11,023
I was gonna heal your daughter.

926
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,568
But now I will make sure
that she is never healed.

927
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,364
Drakey, don't trust
any of these politicians.

928
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:22,451
- You clear out this whole building.
- Thank you, boss.

929
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:26,038
I'm gonna find that little gangster
and I'm gonna take what's in his head.

930
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:28,582
This place is mine now.

931
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:32,044
You wanna come to my fucking house
and play? Let's play.

932
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:35,422
I'm going to annihilate
that little motherfucker.

933
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:38,050
I'm going to pulverize that little one.

934
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,056
Hey!

935
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:53,649
What the hell was that?

936
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:59,572
All members of CCB,
please go to the nearest exit...

937
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:02,241
...and proceed calmly to ground level.

938
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,291
- Move, move, move!
- Go, go, go!

939
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:13,878
No.

940
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:16,505
No more.

941
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:23,929
Citizen deceased.

942
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:39,945
Please exercise caution.
Illegals detected in multiple locations.

943
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:45,659
Emergency systems are now online.
Please follow indicated procedures.

944
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,788
Spider. Do you read me, Spider?

945
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,123
Max, where are you?

946
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,460
The thing in my head, it can make
everyone a citizen here, right?

947
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:58,964
- Yeah.
- You know how to get it out, right?

948
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,883
- Yes.
- You're sure?

949
01:27:01,217 --> 01:27:02,801
Yeah, I'm sure.

950
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,178
Okay, listen carefully.

951
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:14,063
Armoury selected.

952
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,078
Set.

953
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,209
Turn me on.

954
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:41,382
Okay.

955
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:47,263
- Crowe, get rid of those two.
- My pleasure, boss. My pleasure.

956
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,598
Where are you, boykie?
Where are you?

957
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,452
How is it, girl?

958
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,580
- Let's play.
- No.

959
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,458
- Come on. I'll be nice, I promise.
- No, please.

960
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,419
- Come on.
- Get off me.

961
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:20,004
- Want me to hurt the girl?
- No.

962
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,630
- Then come here.
- Please.

963
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,245
Oh, fuck!

964
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:59,126
You fucker!

965
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:07,343
The only way out of here
is through me.

966
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:34,453
- Is she alive?
- For now.

967
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:36,205
Stay behind me.

968
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:40,125
I'm gonna get you out of here.

969
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,002
I have a plan.

970
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:50,302
You hear that sound?
That's the sound of me coming for you.

971
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:54,807
I will find you! I will hunt you down!

972
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:59,228
- Okay, Frey, we have to split up.
- What?

973
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:02,189
Listen. You're gonna go to
the surface, okay? Take this.

974
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:04,691
All right. Find a house.
Get her to a med bay.

975
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:06,735
- It won't work.
- Don't stop for anybody.

976
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:12,032
- She doesn't have an ID. It doesn't work.
- It will this time. I know how to fix it.

977
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:13,700
- Surface selected.
-Go.

978
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,370
- Come with me.
- I'm right behind you.

979
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:18,664
- No.
- I promise.

980
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:42,187
Okay. A mother and a daughter
just went up in that elevator right there.

981
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,690
They're going to the surface,
headed for a med bay.

982
01:30:44,857 --> 01:30:48,735
Send one of your guys, make sure
they get there, and we have our deal.

983
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:49,945
All right.

984
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:52,906
Right to a med bay, man.

985
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:55,909
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

986
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:03,250
- Go, go, go.
- This way. Come on.

987
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,711
- Come on. This way.
- Hurry up, man.

988
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:09,548
Emergency lockdown initiated.

989
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:12,885
Almost there. Almost there.

990
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:22,102
Pull it out! It's just a flesh wound, boet.

991
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,406
That's what I'm talking about.

992
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:42,456
- Fire has been detected. All affected...
-Open the door. Open the door.

993
01:31:42,623 --> 01:31:44,666
...areas will be shut down.

994
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,545
- Come on, come on.
- I got it. Go, go, go.

995
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:52,424
Let's go.

996
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,931
Fucking door, come on. Go.
You first, come on.

997
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,974
Emergency lockdown initiated.

998
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:03,602
- Please stand clear of all exits.
-Come on.

999
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,444
Get up. Get up.
Come on, let's go. Stand up.

1000
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:15,531
Come on. Stand up.
Stand up. Come on.

1001
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:20,702
Come on. Stand up.

1002
01:32:21,078 --> 01:32:22,496
Hey.

1003
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:32,130
You little fucker.

1004
01:32:32,548 --> 01:32:35,300
I'm gonna take your fucking head off.

1005
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:37,386
You should definitely stand up now!

1006
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:03,036
Stay there.

1007
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,876
Fuck.

1008
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:17,593
Okay.

1009
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:39,531
- You think you can get through me?
- Come on, Max! Come on!

1010
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:41,241
I'm just getting started.

1011
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,146
Come on.

1012
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,566
Don't give up now. Get up. Come.

1013
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:17,986
Come on, you've got
more than that. I know you.

1014
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,405
You look a little bit dizzy, eh?

1015
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:26,411
Did I get you? Are you bleeding?
You must get that looked at.

1016
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:27,996
Eh, boykie?

1017
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:43,261
You wanna heal that little girl?

1018
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,056
You just need to come through me.

1019
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:02,823
You've got some fire in you, boykie.

1020
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:22,884
You almost had me.

1021
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:25,178
We die together, boykie.

1022
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:37,983
Okay. Okay.

1023
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,652
Okay. Come on, man. Let's go.

1024
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,913
Let's go, man. Let's do it. Come on.

1025
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,840
Okay. Let's go.

1026
01:36:05,886 --> 01:36:07,429
Get the door!

1027
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:14,686
Come on.

1028
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,190
All right. Let's do it.

1029
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,711
All right.

1030
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:47,135
Okay, we're good. We're good.
We're good.

1031
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:48,929
What?

1032
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:54,184
Max?

1033
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:56,394
It's okay. I know.

1034
01:36:57,604 --> 01:36:59,397
There's no coming back from this.

1035
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,983
No med bay can heal you.

1036
01:37:16,206 --> 01:37:17,833
All right. Give it to me.

1037
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:22,128
Take it.

1038
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:27,759
Okay. You just have to
press that button.

1039
01:37:31,847 --> 01:37:33,265
Frey.

1040
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:37,018
Max? Max, where are you?

1041
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,521
I'm gonna have to break my promise.

1042
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:42,357
I can't make it back up there.

1043
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,861
You remember what I said
when we were kids?

1044
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:47,112
Yes.

1045
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:50,782
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really?

1046
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:52,158
Yeah, I promise.

1047
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:04,796
You wouldn't believe
what I'm looking at now.

1048
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:15,557
Tell Matilda I really liked her story.

1049
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:17,100
And I...

1050
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:21,688
I figured out why the hippo did it.

1051
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,217
Come on.

1052
01:38:52,469 --> 01:38:54,179
You first. Come on.

1053
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:57,349
Everyone has one special thing, Max.

1054
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:00,518
One thing that they are destined to do.

1055
01:39:01,478 --> 01:39:03,730
One thing they were born for.

1056
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:11,571
- Neutralise him.
- Fuck you!

1057
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:21,373
Let go of me.

1058
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,554
Come on.

1059
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:00,912
Hey, Chiquita.

1060
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:08,753
Hey.

1061
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:14,426
Stand down, officers.

1062
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:25,937
- Arrest him!
- I cannot arrest a citizen of Elysium.

1063
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:30,316
- What?
- You did a great job.

1064
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:34,112
Guess who Elysium belongs to now.

1065
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:32,545
You see how beautiful it looks to us
from here?

1066
01:41:33,088 --> 01:41:36,216
Now look how beautiful
we look from there.

1067
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:38,218
This is yours now.

1068
01:41:39,135 --> 01:41:42,847
To never forget about
where you come from.

1069
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:56,903
My little Max.
