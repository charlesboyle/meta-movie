1
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,770
- Hi, sis.
- Hey.

2
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,811
- Hi.
- Hey, Carolyn.

3
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,730
Michael, if I could just get
you to sign this right...

4
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,967
Whoops.

5
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,246
Here, which gives you the
contents of the safe deposit box.

6
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,087
Fine. Thank you. And this
one, which clears the bank...

7
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,210
of all responsibility
for the contents.

8
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,925
It's kind of exciting, huh?

9
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,449
Maybe we'll find out that your
mother had secret millions.

10
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,362
Why don't we get started?
Your mother is interred...

11
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,601
at the Cedar Heights Funeral Home
until arrangements can be made.

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,246
I thought it was arranged.

13
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,488
- Well, there's a problem.
- What problem?

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,770
Well, your mother left explicit
instructions to be cremated.

15
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,007
- Cremated?
- Ew.

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,602
- I don't understand it either.
- When did she decide this?

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,531
Oh, apparently just
before her death.

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,566
- I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
- Lots of people do.

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,362
Nobody in my family did. Dad
bought plots at Prairie Hills...

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,130
one for him, one for Mom.

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,728
- The will clearly states...
- I don't care what it says.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,369
Maybe Mom was delirious. Maybe she
didn't know what she was saying.

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,049
If she wanted to be cremated, why the
hell did she let Dad buy two plots, huh?

24
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,163
She was very specific.

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,241
She wanted her ashes to be
thrown off Roseman Bridge.

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,204
- What?!
- Bizarre!

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,244
Mr. Peterson, are you
sure Mom wrote all this?

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,206
It was notarized and witnessed
by Mrs. Lucy Delaney.

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,607
- Maybe you could ask her.
- Who the hell is she?

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,848
I remember her, I just don't...

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,770
I don't care if it's legal. We're
not cremating her and throwing...

32
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,408
her ashes off some bridge
where we can't visit her...

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,251
because she'll be blown all over!

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,720
- And people driving all over her, dogs...
- We're not doing it.

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,402
I'm not even sure it's Christian.

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,723
Maybe it's an Italian thing.
She was Italian.

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,928
Doesn't matter!

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,925
Move on.

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,162
We can come back to this.

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,091
Why don't we open the box?

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,288
Michael, look at these.

42
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,281
Have you ever seen these pictures?

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,087
Huh?

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,090
It was in this envelope from 1965.

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,329
She's not wearing a bra.

46
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,481
That's the Holliwell Bridge.

47
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,731
- In case anyone's interested.
- Why are there two deeds here?

48
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,289
Oh, this is for the additional
acres he purchased in '59.

49
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,285
And this?

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,608
Those were bills of sale from
equipment your mother sold.

51
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,921
- This is for the original land parcel.
- Beautiful picture of her.

52
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,963
- Michael.
- Yeah?

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,527
- Michael.
- What?

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,287
Could you come here for a minute?

55
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,487
What?

56
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,405
Where are we going?

57
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,850
She say anything in there about me?
About leaving me anything?

58
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,883
No.

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,440
What's going on?

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,809
Um...

61
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,001
We were just wondering
if it might be better...

62
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,886
if Carolyn and I looked
at this stuff ourselves.

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,811
We don't want to keep
you waiting around.

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,843
I'll, uh...

65
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,328
I'll contact your office
about the legal work.

66
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,446
"I struggle to...

67
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,324
put it together in a way that
allows me to continue...

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,643
knowing that we're
on separate roads.

69
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,530
Then...

70
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,721
But then, I look through the lens
of my camera and you're there.

71
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,926
I start to write an article and I
find myself writing it to you.

72
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,764
It's clear to me now that we have
been moving towards each other...

73
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,884
towards those four
days, all of our lives."

74
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,845
I don't want to hear anymore.
Burn the damn thing.

75
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,844
I don't want to hear it.

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,925
Throw it away.

77
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,724
What's he saying now?

78
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,967
He just goes on about how
if Mom ever needed him...

79
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,007
she could reach him through the
National Geographic magazine in D.C.

80
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,682
He was a photographer.

81
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,687
He promises not to write again.

82
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,011
And then, all it says is:

83
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,527
"I love you. Robert."

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,650
Robert.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,525
Jesus.

86
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,926
I'll kill him.

87
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,803
That would be some trick. He's dead.
That's what this letter is...

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,764
from his attorney.

89
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,926
He left most of his things to Mom.

90
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,444
And requested...

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,401
What?

92
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,049
That he be cremated and his ashes
thrown off Roseman Bridge.

93
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,291
Damn him. I knew Mom wouldn't
have thought that up herself.

94
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,168
It was some damn perverted...

95
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,689
photographic mind influencing her.

96
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,644
When did the bastard die?

97
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,205
'82.

98
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,569
Wait a minute, that was...

99
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,363
three years after Daddy...
Do you think...?

100
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,370
I don't know. I'm
completely in the dark.

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,528
That's what I get for moving away.

102
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,371
We were kids when
this happened. I...

103
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,083
I can't believe it.

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,450
Do you think that she...

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,449
had sex with him?

106
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,605
Must be nice inside your head with
Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.

107
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,724
Don't talk to me like that.
She was my mother!

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,571
Now I find that she was...
She was a...

109
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,524
A what? Don't say that!

110
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,768
What am I supposed to think?

111
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,966
I can't believe she never told me.

112
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,525
We spoke at least once a week.
How could she do that?

113
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,291
When did she meet him?
Did Dad know?

114
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,570
Is there anything else
in that envelope?

115
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,048
No, I don't think so.

116
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,770
You read it.

117
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,571
You read it.

118
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,091
"January, 1987.

119
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,850
Dear Carolyn:

120
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,841
I hope you're reading
this with Michael.

121
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,288
I'm sure he wouldn't be able
to read it by himself...

122
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,370
and he'll need help
understanding all this.

123
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,090
First and most of all...

124
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,607
I love you both very much.

125
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,162
And although I feel fine,
I thought I'd put my affairs...

126
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,164
...excuse that word, in order."

127
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,847
I can't believe she's making jokes.

128
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,691
"After going through the
safety deposit box...

129
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,328
I'm sure you'll find
your way to this letter.

130
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,251
It's hard to write this
to my own children.

131
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,365
I could let this die with
the rest of me, I suppose.

132
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,848
But as one gets older...

133
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,401
one's fears subside.

134
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,011
What becomes more and
more important...

135
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,370
is to be known.

136
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,327
Known for all that you were
during this brief stay.

137
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,046
How sad it seems to
leave this earth...

138
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,247
without those you love the most
ever really knowing who you were.

139
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,731
It's easy for a mother to love
her children, no matter what.

140
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,651
I don't know if it's as
simple for children.

141
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,930
You're all so busy being angry
at us for raising you wrong.

142
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,046
His name was Robert Kincaid.

143
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,087
He was a photographer and
he was here in 1965...

144
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,521
shooting an article for
<i>National Geographic...</i>

145
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,570
on the covered bridges
of Madison County.

146
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,361
Remember when we got that issue,
how we felt like celebrities?

147
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,285
Remember when we started
getting the subscription?"

148
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,329
That's Roseman Bridge.

149
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,321
That must be Robert Kincaid.

150
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,481
And that's Mom's medallion.

151
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,290
"I don't want you to
be angry with him.

152
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,726
I hope after you know the story,
you think well of him, even grateful."

153
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,010
- Grateful?
- "It's all there in the three notebooks."

154
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,081
"it was the week of the
Illinois State Fair.

155
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,526
The two of you were going
with Dad to exhibit...

156
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,966
Carolyn's prize steer.

157
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,401
It was the Sunday night you left.
I know it sounds awful..."

158
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,080
<i>But I couldn't wait
for you to leave.</i>

159
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,601
<i>You were going to be
gone until Friday.</i>

160
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,890
<i>Four days.</i>

161
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,083
<i>Just four days.</i>

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,970
Michael! Carolyn!

163
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,402
Richard! Dinner!

164
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,845
- What I tell you about the door?
- Sorry.

165
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,044
Okay, so, would you
like to say grace?

166
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,170
Grace.

167
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,127
- Uh.
- Oh, more sauces.

168
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,610
A piece of bread.

169
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,767
Thanks.

170
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,882
<i>That was The Shangri-Las
with the number 10 spot...</i>

171
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,401
<i>and moving up to number nine
on this week's nifty 50...</i>

172
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,722
<i>is "Baby, I'm Yours."</i>

173
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,930
Damn drawer.

174
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,527
Here.

175
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,649
You can't get mad at it.

176
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,770
Sorry. Didn't mean to yell.

177
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,162
I want you to stay away
from anything too spicy.

178
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,250
- Mm-hm.
- And you promise me.

179
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,161
I swear. Only filters. No
more than half pack a day.

180
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,881
- I've got my orders.
- Doc Reynolds said so.

181
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,122
- I know, I'm only kidding.
- Yeah.

182
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,683
- Are you sure you don't want to go?
- I'm positive.

183
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,891
What are you going to do
as a woman of leisure?

184
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,170
Same thing I do as a hired
hand, except with less help.

185
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,481
I won't be able to sleep. I can't sleep
without you next to me anymore.

186
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,530
It's only 4 days, hon.

187
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,130
Okay.

188
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,520
Oh, God, where have you been, huh?

189
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,720
You missed them, you know.
They already left.

190
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,410
Why do you love me so much?
You know I don't like you.

191
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,170
Get down.

192
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,731
God.

193
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,204
You like that song?

194
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,363
It's just you and me, buddy.

195
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,250
Just you and me.

196
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,327
Hi.

197
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,409
I get the distinct
feeling that I'm lost.

198
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,289
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?

199
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,610
Yeah.

200
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,048
Well, then you're not that lost.

201
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,642
I'm looking for a bridge.

202
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,889
One of those covered bridges
in this neighborhood.

203
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,611
Roseman Bridge?

204
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,246
That's it.

205
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,485
Well, you're pretty close. It's
only about two miles from here.

206
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,451
Which way?

207
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,122
Well, you go that way and come
to Cutter's and turn left.

208
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,484
To Cutters?

209
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,289
Cutter's a farm. Small
house, close to the road.

210
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,244
Big, mean yellow dog.

211
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,842
Mean yellow dog. Okay.

212
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,891
Yeah. Then you go along that
road until you come to a fork.

213
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,005
It's only... Less than half a mile.

214
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,127
And then where, after the fork?

215
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,365
The right.

216
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,205
And then you...

217
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,761
No, no. Not that fork. Excuse me.

218
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,731
You pass Peterson's.

219
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,287
Peterson's.

220
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,043
Peterson's is a farm.

221
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,723
Past the old schoolhouse, you turn
left. It'd be easier to tell you...

222
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,849
if the roads were marked.

223
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,089
Yeah, it certainly would.

224
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,081
Well, I can take you if you want.

225
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,805
Or I can tell you.

226
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,170
I can take you or tell you.

227
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,886
Either way, it's up to you.
I don't care.

228
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,291
I wouldn't want to take you
away from what you're doing.

229
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,921
No, I was just going to have
some iced tea, and then...

230
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,567
split the atom, but that can wait.

231
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,166
Okay.

232
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,089
I'll just get my shoes.

233
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,691
I wasn't exactly expecting company.

234
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,971
Okay.

235
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,770
Where are we headed?

236
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,728
Out. Then right.

237
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,121
Out...

238
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,965
then right.

239
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,648
Wonderful smell to Iowa. Kind of
particular to this part of the country.

240
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,330
You know what I mean?

241
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,207
No.

242
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,011
It's kind of hard to explain.
I guess it's in the loam of the soil.

243
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,367
That kind of rich, earthy...

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,685
alive... Well, maybe not alive.

245
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,291
Anyway, you don't smell it?

246
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,128
Maybe it's because I live here.

247
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,170
Yeah, I guess so.

248
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,329
Smells great, though.

249
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,402
Are you from Washington originally?

250
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,410
Yeah, I lived there till
I was in my mid-20s.

251
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,160
I moved to Chicago
when I got married.

252
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,644
Oh.

253
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,450
When did you move back?

254
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,570
After the divorce.

255
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,729
Oh.

256
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,562
How long have you been married?

257
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,321
Um...

258
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,566
Long time.

259
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,527
- Long time, huh?
- Mm.

260
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,166
Where are you from?
Do you mind me asking?

261
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,365
No, I don't mind
your asking. I'm from...

262
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,482
- I'm born in Italy.
- Italy, huh?

263
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,730
Yeah.

264
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,322
From Italy to Iowa.
Whereabouts in Italy?

265
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,403
We lived in a small town
on the eastern side.

266
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,409
No one's ever heard
of it. Called Bari.

267
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,203
- Bari?
- Mm-hm.

268
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,890
Yeah, I know Bari.

269
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,685
- No.
- Yeah.

270
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,041
- Really?
- Yeah.

271
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,568
I was on assignment to Greece...

272
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,570
and I had to go through Bari
to get the boat in Brindisi.

273
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,888
I was looking out, it
looked like pretty country.

274
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,686
So I got off the train
and stayed a few days.

275
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,091
You just got off the train
because it looked pretty?

276
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,610
Yeah.

277
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,729
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

278
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,366
Excuse me.

279
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,605
Care for a cigarette?

280
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,963
Uh, sure. Sure, I'll have one.

281
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,890
So tell me, how long
have you lived in Iowa?

282
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,163
Long. You just got off the train...

283
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,886
and stayed without
knowing anyone there?

284
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,730
Yeah.

285
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,691
That's it.

286
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,044
- It's beautiful.
- Mm.

287
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,444
Yeah, this is great.

288
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,330
I won't shoot this today.
I'll just do a little prep work.

289
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,484
Shoot it tomorrow. The
light's no good right now.

290
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,727
Okay.

291
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,167
So I'll just wait.

292
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,731
I don't mind.

293
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,723
Go on down here.

294
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,523
This is about as good a
place to start as any.

295
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,720
- Beautiful bridge.
- Mm.

296
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,048
Beautiful. You out here much?

297
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,487
No.

298
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,403
Always this hot around here?

299
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,006
Oh, yes. This time of year. Yeah.

300
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,322
There's some sodas in back of
the truck if you'd like one.

301
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,843
- Oh, would you like one?
- Not right now.

302
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,491
I'll go get one.

303
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,964
Oh, there you are.

304
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,245
You caught me.

305
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,167
I was just picking
you some flowers.

306
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,800
Oh?

307
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,242
Men still do that, don't they?
I'm not out of date, am I?

308
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,444
Picking flowers for a woman
as a sign of appreciation?

309
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,888
No, except those are poisonous.

310
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,524
I'm kidding! I'm sorry.

311
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,203
I'm just kidding.

312
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,564
I never... I'm so sorry.

313
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,571
Are you sadistic by nature or what?

314
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,529
I don't know why I did that.

315
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,604
- Here.
- They're beautiful.

316
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,125
I'm sorry.

317
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,209
You looking for something in particular?
There's not much selection.

318
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,929
I had a station out of Chicago
earlier. Played good blues.

319
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,484
It's 1410.

320
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,730
That's nice.

321
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,724
Care for another cigarette?

322
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,811
Sure.

323
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,163
Is that the mean yellow dog?

324
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,207
- Is it white?
- No, it's yellow.

325
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,527
Well, I want to thank you for all
your kindnesses, Mrs. Johnson.

326
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,370
Francesca.

327
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,281
Robert.

328
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,448
Would you like some iced tea?

329
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,727
Yeah.

330
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,610
Yes, sit down.

331
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,040
- You like lemon?
- Sure.

332
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,041
Maybe...

333
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,971
a little bit of sugar?

334
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,406
You bet.

335
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,402
If you want more...

336
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,607
Thanks.

337
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,047
Aren't you afraid to
have those in here?

338
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,403
I'm so sorry I did that.
I don't know why...

339
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,250
Why I said that.

340
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,841
Where are you staying
while you're here?

341
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,763
Uh, some place with small cabins.

342
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,929
Something-or-other motor inn.

343
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,164
I've got it written down,
but I haven't checked in yet.

344
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,967
And how long are you here for?

345
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,886
Well, I don't know, maybe four or
five days, a week at the outside.

346
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,806
As long as it takes to do the work.
Where's your family?

347
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,890
My husband took the kids
to the Illinois state fair.

348
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,930
My daughter is entering
a prize steer.

349
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,327
- How old?
- Oh, uh, a year and a half.

350
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,290
No, I meant the kids.

351
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,720
Oh.

352
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,646
Michael is 17 and Carolyn is 16.

353
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,801
- That's nice, having kids.
- Yeah.

354
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,489
Yeah. They're not kids anymore.

355
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,650
Things change.

356
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,490
They always do.

357
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,769
One of the laws of nature.

358
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,287
Most people are afraid of change,
but if you look at it like...

359
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,882
it's something you always can count
on, then it can be a comfort.

360
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,762
There's not many things
you can really count on.

361
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,008
Yeah, I guess.

362
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,004
I'm one of those people
that it frightens, I think.

363
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,241
No, I doubt that.

364
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,364
Why do you say that?

365
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,522
Well, from Italy to Iowa,
that's a big change.

366
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,810
Oh, yeah.

367
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,771
But Richard was in the Army there.

368
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,204
I met him when I was
living in Naples.

369
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,727
I didn't know anything about Iowa.

370
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,205
I just cared that it was America...

371
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,887
and, of course,
being with Richard. So...

372
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,371
What's he like?

373
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,723
He's very clean.

374
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,726
Clean?

375
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,571
Yeah. No. I mean...

376
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,971
He's other things too.

377
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,888
He's a very hard worker...

378
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,246
very caring...

379
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,720
honest.

380
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,085
He's gentle.

381
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,884
He's a good father.

382
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
And clean.

383
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,211
Yeah. Clean.

384
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,403
And you like living
here in Iowa, I guess?

385
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,731
Mmm. Yeah...

386
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,244
Go ahead. I'm not
going to tell anyone.

387
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,602
I'm supposed to say:

388
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,761
"Oh, it's just fine. It's quiet
and the people are real nice."

389
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,765
And all that's true. Mostly.

390
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,610
It is quiet.

391
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,448
And the people are nice.

392
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,770
In certain ways.

393
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,602
You know, we all
help each other out.

394
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,287
If someone gets sick or hurt,
all the neighbors come in.

395
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,884
They pick the corn, harvest the
oats or whatever needs to be done.

396
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,002
If you go into town, you can leave your car
unlocked, and let the kids run around.

397
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,645
Don't worry about them.

398
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,088
There are a lot of nice...

399
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,288
things about the people here.

400
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,801
And I respect them
for those qualities.

401
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,207
But...

402
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,207
But?

403
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,323
Well, it's not...

404
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,649
what I dreamed of...

405
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,845
as a girl.

406
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,525
You know, I scribbled
something down the other day.

407
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,529
I often do that when
I'm out on the road.

408
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,683
Kind of goes like this:

409
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,843
"The old dreams...

410
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,524
were good dreams.

411
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,368
They didn't work out,
but I'm glad I had them."

412
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,046
I don't know what it means.
I thought I might use it someday.

413
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,722
Anyway, I think I
know how you feel.

414
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,528
Would you like to stay for dinner?

415
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,528
There's not much of
a choice in town.

416
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,247
And you'd have to eat alone.

417
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,051
So would I.

418
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,564
Yeah, I'd like that.
I'd like that, yeah.

419
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,606
I don't get a home-cooked meal too often
out on the road. I'd like that a lot.

420
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,967
Okay.

421
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,964
This is ridiculous.

422
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,209
Oh.

423
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,645
Do you mind if I put
some film in the fridge?

424
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,123
- No, go ahead.
- This heat out here isn't too forgiving.

425
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,767
Anything I can do to help?

426
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,367
- To help? What, cook?
- Yeah, men cook.

427
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,010
Okay, sure.

428
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,131
Yeah.

429
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,761
Sure.

430
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,405
Well, what can I do?

431
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,205
You can scrape the carrot.

432
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,045
Scrape the carrots?

433
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,567
And grate them. Make a nice salad.

434
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,205
All right.

435
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,408
Scrape the carrots.
Like that. How's that?

436
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,728
Very good. Very nice.

437
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,525
Not bad, huh?

438
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,566
Don't forget to pick off the end.

439
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,370
Okay.

440
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,883
Pick off end.

441
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,246
Let me get these...

442
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,002
Excuse me. I can take the
ends off of these too.

443
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,564
Hmm? Yes. That's a good idea.

444
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,565
This the way you do it?

445
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,244
That's good. But don't use
your fingers because...

446
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,084
you know, then they smell like...

447
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,084
I'll get you some lemon.

448
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,921
Right.

449
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,447
- Say, would you like a beer?
- Yeah.

450
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,126
- I've got some in the car.
- I would love a beer.

451
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,204
Anything to get out
of a little work.

452
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,921
Very nice.

453
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,446
Nice.

454
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,641
- Ha-ha-ha.
- No, wait a second. It gets better.

455
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,247
You've gotta picture this: There I am
with three cameras around my neck...

456
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,284
and I've got a tripod, and my
pants are around my ankles.

457
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,882
I'm behind a bush, and then all
of a sudden I see this gorilla.

458
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,811
The hugest gorilla you've ever
seen, staring right at me...

459
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,890
with the most lascivious look
you've ever seen in your life.

460
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,402
I mean, more than you've ever seen
on any creature with that much hair.

461
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,282
Well, I freeze, of course, because
that's what you're supposed to do.

462
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,091
And then it started
coming towards me.

463
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,650
And what?

464
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,930
What? Oh, my God!

465
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,486
I can't...

466
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,644
You're blushing.

467
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,281
It's a very painful subject.
A very sore...

468
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,801
sore subject matter, really.

469
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,688
- What happened?
- We became engaged.

470
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,929
You should really...

471
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,527
write these stories down.

472
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,121
- I would, except this is a female gorilla.
- Uh-oh!

473
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,765
It had on eye shadow...

474
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,560
and a little lip gloss on her
little lips and it was so nice...

475
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,246
We still write.

476
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,241
I don't want to put
this stuff down.

477
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,091
I'm afraid...

478
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,844
I'm afraid my writing's
a little too technical.

479
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,642
The trouble with being a
journalist too long is...

480
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,565
you stop giving yourself
permission to invent.

481
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,211
I think I'll just stick
to making pictures.

482
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,449
Making pictures.

483
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,205
I like that.

484
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,521
You really love what you do.

485
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,329
Yeah. I'm obsessed by it, really.

486
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,728
Why is that, do you think?

487
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,611
I don't know.

488
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,329
I don't think obsessions have reasons.
That's why they're obsessions.

489
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,769
You sound like an artist.

490
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,884
I wouldn't say that.

491
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,409
<i>National Geographic</i>
likes their photos in focus...

492
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,924
and not too much personal
comment. I don't mind really.

493
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,571
I'm no artist.

494
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,364
That's one of the curses of being
too well-adjusted, too normal.

495
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,807
I don't think you're so normal.

496
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,607
Really?

497
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,087
I didn't mean it in the way...

498
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,727
In the way that it sounded.
I mean, you know...

499
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,571
That's, uh...

500
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,287
That's all right. We'll just
chalk it up to a compliment...

501
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,045
and move on.

502
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,923
Did you just love teaching?

503
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,731
Yes, when there was a particular
student who can make a difference...

504
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,522
They're all supposed to,
but they don't. You tend...

505
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,125
to single out 1 or 2 who you think
you can contribute something to.

506
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,291
- And did you?
- I hope so. One went to medical school.

507
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,531
Why'd you quit?

508
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,641
My children, my kids.

509
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,804
And...

510
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,051
Richard didn't like my working.

511
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,963
But you miss it, obviously.

512
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,164
I never think about it.

513
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,569
What's the most exciting
place that you've ever been?

514
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,364
- Hm?
- Hm.

515
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,122
- Unless you're too tired to talk.
- Most exciting...

516
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,291
If you're asking if a man's tired of talking
about himself, you haven't been out much.

517
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,446
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
make it sound like a dumb...

518
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,967
No, just maybe it's a
little dull for you...

519
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,721
sitting here telling this to some
housewife in the middle of nowhere.

520
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,165
This is your home.
This isn't nowhere.

521
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,891
And it's not dull.

522
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,685
Let's see.

523
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:16,126
I guess I'd say that the most exciting
place I've been to was Africa.

524
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,363
Because it's another world.

525
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,883
It's not just the
cultures and the people.

526
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,322
That's great, but it's the air.

527
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,000
The colors from dawn to dusk.

528
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,726
There's something tangible
about the whole thing.

529
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,843
The cohabitation of man and
beast, and beast and beast.

530
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,202
Who'll survive and who won't.

531
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,526
There's no judgment
about it either.

532
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,882
There's no imposed morality.

533
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,726
It's just the way it is.

534
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,162
It's beautiful, really.

535
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,727
Just nothing like it. It's...

536
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,440
a voyeur's paradise.

537
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,042
I'd love to see that.

538
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,369
They have safaris. You
could ask your husband.

539
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,091
Yeah.

540
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,527
Looks like it's a beautiful evening out.
Would you like to take a walk?

541
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,330
Mm-hm.

542
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,602
You've got it all right here.

543
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,404
I'm serious. This is as nice
a place as I've ever been.

544
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,567
<i>The silver apples of the moon
And golden apples of the sun</i>

545
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,767
Yeats. "The Song of
Wandering Aengus."

546
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,610
Huh?

547
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,201
- Good stuff, Yeats, huh?
- Yes.

548
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,649
Realism, economy, sensuousness...

549
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,482
beauty and magic. All that
appeals to my Irish ancestry.

550
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,686
- Something wrong?
- No. Would you like something to drink?

551
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,644
Maybe some coffee?

552
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,049
Maybe some brandy?

553
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,044
Maybe some both.

554
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,971
- Yes?
- Yeah.

555
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,971
Let's.

556
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,161
Sure you don't want me
to help you clean up?

557
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,720
No. I'm not going to wash them now.
I'll rinse them now. I'll do it later.

558
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,804
Francesca.

559
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,726
Huh?

560
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,531
You all right?

561
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,011
Yeah.

562
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,769
Francesca.

563
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,485
What?

564
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,086
What?

565
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,722
We're not doing anything
wrong, you know.

566
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,121
Nothing you couldn't tell
your children about.

567
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,920
To ancient evenings
and distant music?

568
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,880
He's getting her drunk.
That's what happened.

569
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,523
Jesus, maybe he forced himself.
That's why she couldn't tell us.

570
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,291
Oh, he did not.

571
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,128
- He's such a nice guy.
- Trying to sleep with somebody's wife?

572
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,484
I don't think so. And that
doesn't make you a bad person.

573
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,408
He reminds me of
Steve in a way. Steve's...

574
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,088
weak, immoral and a liar,
but he's still a real nice guy.

575
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,123
He just shouldn't be married.

576
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,770
At least not to me.

577
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,763
I'm hungry. Are you getting hungry?

578
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,767
I had no idea it's
gotten that bad, sis.

579
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,082
Oh, please don't feel sorry for me.
Nobody's forcing me to stay.

580
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,646
Why do you?

581
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,721
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- No.

582
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,684
Why did you get divorced?

583
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,129
I was never around.

584
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,844
So Why'd I get married?
That's a good question.

585
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,682
I guess I needed a
home base. Roots.

586
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,289
You can kind of get
lost on the road.

587
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,086
Mm. So, what happened?

588
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,490
I never got lost.

589
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,082
I was more at home everywhere
than just in one place.

590
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,886
Kind of like a citizen
of the world.

591
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,442
- Must get lonely sometimes.
- No. I never indulge in that.

592
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,688
I've got friends all over the world I can
visit from time to time if I feel like it.

593
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,010
Women friends too?

594
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,206
Well, I'm a loner, but not a monk.

595
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,568
You really don't need anyone?

596
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,445
No, I think I...

597
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,404
I think I need everyone.

598
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,405
I love people. I'd
love to meet them all.

599
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,364
Yeah, that's the thing about Iowa.

600
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,406
You tend to meet the same kind
of person over and over again.

601
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,003
So when Mrs. Delaney's husband has
an affair with the Redfield woman...

602
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,282
- ...the whole town wakes up.
- Yeah.

603
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,922
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of that going around.

604
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,246
It seems to me there's too much of:

605
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,046
"This is mine"
and "He or she is mine."

606
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,846
There's just too many
lines being drawn.

607
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,320
You know?

608
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,924
Doesn't it scare you though?
Being alone?

609
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,604
I don't think so.

610
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,922
I think I embrace the mystery.

611
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,889
Do you ever regret it?

612
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,930
- What?
- The divorce, I mean.

613
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,125
No.

614
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,046
Do you ever regret
not having a family?

615
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,167
Not everyone's supposed
to have a family.

616
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,885
How can you live for just what
you want? What about other people?

617
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,848
- I told you, I love other people.
- But no one in particular.

618
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,203
- But I love them just the same.
- It's not the same.

619
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,801
I know it's not the same...

620
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,444
but what you're saying is it's not as
good, it's not normal, it's not proper.

621
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,085
No, that's not what I said.

622
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,802
I have a little bit of a problem
with this American family ethic...

623
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,084
that seems to have hypnotized
the whole country.

624
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:01,326
You probably think of somebody like
me as a poor, displaced soul...

625
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,684
who's destined to wander the planet with
not having a TV or self-cleaning oven.

626
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,282
Just because someone
decides to settle down...

627
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,966
and have a family doesn't
mean they're hypnotized.

628
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,126
Just because I've never
seen a gazelle stampede...

629
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,681
doesn't mean I'm asleep in my life.

630
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,285
You wanna leave your husband?

631
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,366
No. Of course not.

632
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,771
I'm sorry about that.
I apologize for that.

633
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,684
What made you ask such a question?

634
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,322
I thought that's what we're doing.
Asking questions. It was stupid. I'm sorry.

635
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,568
No, I thought we were
having a conversation.

636
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,800
But you're asking me these questions,
you're reading these meanings into it.

637
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,965
It's meanings I must be too simple
to understand or interpret.

638
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,565
I'm sorry.

639
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,006
I apologize.

640
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,403
Well, Roseman Bridge at dawn.

641
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,249
I guess I better be going.

642
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,407
- Look, I'm sorry.
- No.

643
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,769
I apologize. You must forgive me.

644
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,930
That was a very indiscreet
question. It was just...

645
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,440
dumb.

646
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,288
I feel like something's
been spoiled now.

647
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,404
It was a perfect evening,
just the way it was.

648
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,242
Perfect evening...

649
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,965
a nice walk.

650
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,084
Thank you for the...

651
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,802
company and the brandy.

652
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,447
You're a good woman, Francesca.

653
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,289
Keep that brandy forward in the cupboard.
It might work out after a while.

654
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,124
Oh...

655
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,607
And don't kid yourself, Francesca.

656
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,003
You're anything but a simple woman.

657
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,325
Johnson's.

658
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,961
Richard, hi.

659
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,929
Yes.

660
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,282
Everyone settled in okay?

661
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,723
Uh-huh.

662
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,445
Good.

663
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,324
I said, "good."

664
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,160
Johnson's.

665
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,886
<i>Hi, it's Robert Kincaid.</i>

666
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,565
Hi.

667
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,607
<i>I got your note.</i>

668
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,928
W.B. Yeats and all.

669
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,604
I put it in my pocket and didn't read it
right away because the light was changing.

670
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,769
I had to get my shots.

671
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,650
The light was changing.

672
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,767
<i>Yeah. But I do accept your invitation.
It'll have to be later though.</i>

673
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,049
<i>I'm going to the Holliwell Bridge
and do some shooting over there.</i>

674
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,641
<i>- After 9:00, how about that?</i>
- Yes.

675
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,567
Yes, get your work done.
That's what's important.

676
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,929
I'll make something nice we can
warm up when you get here.

677
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,329
You know, it's just a thought. Maybe
you'd like to come along with me.

678
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,647
Yes, I would like that, but I...

679
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,086
I'll drive my pickup and meet
you there. All right?

680
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,760
<i>- All right.</i>
- What time?

681
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,042
<i>How about 6:00?</i>

682
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,210
Okay.

683
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,121
Great. Okay. Bye.

684
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,450
Bye. Hmm.

685
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,681
- God, it's Lucy Redfield.
- Apparently Mrs. Delaney caught them.

686
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,722
There's a seat down
here, if you'd like.

687
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,726
Thank you.

688
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,564
Kind of hot out, isn't it?

689
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,327
Yeah.

690
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,371
Well? Are you ordering anything?

691
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,605
No.

692
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,761
Thanks. I've changed my mind.

693
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,450
How about this one?

694
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,731
Mmm.

695
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,610
Oh, it's...

696
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,360
Oh, I don't know, I don't
know, I don't know.

697
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,644
I haven't bought a dress
for myself in so long.

698
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,605
I'm just buying a dress. It's
not for a special occasion.

699
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,122
I'm just shopping for
a new dress is all.

700
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,049
That might work.

701
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,245
And if he's still mad, tell him
you married him out of pity.

702
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,568
That always works for me.

703
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,850
Johnson's.

704
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,844
<i>Hi, it's Robert.</i>

705
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,685
Oh, hi.

706
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,930
Listen, I'm running a
little late. But I'll still...

707
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,167
<i>be there.</i>

708
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,170
I don't want this to
sound the wrong way...

709
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,091
but I'm wondering if this
is such a good idea.

710
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,087
Oh?

711
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,805
<i>I had lunch in town.</i>

712
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,163
And I crossed paths with
that Redfield woman.

713
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,964
Oh.

714
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,401
I guess you got the whole story.

715
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,164
The cashier at the grocery
store was most generous.

716
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,966
Yeah.

717
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,521
He's running for town
crier next year.

718
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,768
<i>I know more about the
Delaney affair...</i>

719
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,530
<i>than I knew about my marriage.</i>

720
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,246
If it's gonna be a problem
for you to see me tonight...

721
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,363
don't feel pressured to do so.

722
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,643
I'm sometimes not too bright
about people's reactions.

723
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,209
<i>I wouldn't want you to be put
in a compromising situation.</i>

724
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,242
Yeah, I understand.

725
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,722
That's very kind of
you to think of that.

726
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,681
Robert?

727
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,321
Yeah?

728
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,643
I want to come.

729
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,081
Okay? So I'll meet you at the
bridge like we planned...

730
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,601
and don't worry about
the rest of it.

731
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,771
I'm not.

732
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,647
All right. I'll see you then.

733
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,451
Okay.

734
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,809
- Bye.
- Bye.

735
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,805
Hi.

736
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,011
Beautiful here.

737
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,682
Make yourself at home. I just
gotta knock off a few shots here.

738
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,366
Oh, look at the butterfly.

739
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,331
- Got you!
- Oh!

740
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,000
Come on.

741
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,281
- No, don't take my picture.
- Yeah, come on.

742
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,522
Go ahead, give me a pose. Come on.

743
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,727
One of those French model looks.

744
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,807
- I can't.
- Like Gina Lollobrigida.

745
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,605
Oh, can I help?

746
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,566
No. No, I've got
everything under control.

747
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,849
I'm just going to go...

748
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,562
clean myself up a bit.
I'm going to take a bath.

749
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,451
What happens if I set the table?

750
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,082
Oh. That's fine. Sure. Good.

751
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,288
Would you like a beer...

752
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,766
for your bath?

753
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,167
Yeah.

754
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,484
That's nice.

755
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,204
Dinner will be ready...

756
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,130
in half an hour.

757
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,602
<i>I realized that he had been here...</i>

758
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,723
<i>just a few minutes before.</i>

759
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,405
<i>I was lying where the water
had run down his body...</i>

760
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,524
<i>and I found that intensely erotic.</i>

761
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,966
<i>Almost everything about
Robert Kincaid...</i>

762
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,170
<i>had begun to seem erotic to me.</i>

763
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,480
What's wrong?

764
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,166
You look stunning. If you
don't mind me saying so.

765
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,561
Make-them-run-around-the-block-
howling-in-agony stunning.

766
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,287
Johnson's. Hi.

767
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,161
Hi, Madge. Yeah.

768
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,090
No, I was just...

769
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,402
fixing myself something to eat.

770
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,925
No, what?

771
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,605
Oh, yeah, I heard about him.

772
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,843
I hear he's some kind of
photographer or something.

773
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,245
Uh-huh.

774
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,323
Hippie? No. Uh...

775
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,887
I don't know, is that
what a hippie looks like?

776
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:37,007
Um, no, I was just going to step into
a bath when you called, so maybe...

777
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,122
Yeah, they don't get
back till Friday.

778
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,801
Yeah. Maybe I'll
call you then, okay?

779
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,209
Bye.

780
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,925
If you want me to
stop, tell me now.

781
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,647
No one's asking you to.

782
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,925
"He told me he wouldn't apologize
for what was going to happen."

783
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,045
What's the matter?

784
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,922
I'm going to go get some air.

785
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,086
- Take me someplace.
- What?

786
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,124
Right now. Take me someplace...

787
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,930
that you've been.

788
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,605
Someplace on the other
side of the world.

789
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,210
How about Italy?

790
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,165
Yeah.

791
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,004
How about Bari?

792
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,810
Yeah.

793
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,008
Tell me about that time...

794
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,566
that you got off the train.

795
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,689
- Well, you know the station.
- Yeah.

796
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,690
You know the little restaurant
with the striped awning...

797
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,487
<i>serves arancinos.</i>

798
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,011
<i>Arancino.</i>

799
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,491
<i>Arancinos,</i> yeah.

800
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,684
And <i>zeppoli.</i> I know that place.

801
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,841
I had coffee there.

802
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,211
Did you sit...

803
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,681
by the doorway or near
the front of the church?

804
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,250
I was near the church.

805
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,646
I know, I sat there once.

806
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,210
I sat there once...

807
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,244
on a day like this.
It was very hot and...

808
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,728
I'd been shopping and I had all
these packages around my feet.

809
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,922
I had to keep moving them.

810
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,411
Then what?

811
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,446
You make me forget my story.

812
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,930
Lucky me.

813
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,286
<i>I had thoughts about him...</i>

814
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,282
<i>I hardly knew what to do with.</i>

815
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,328
<i>And he read every one.</i>

816
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,930
<i>Whatever I felt.</i>

817
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,851
<i>Whatever I wanted,
he gave himself up to.</i>

818
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,200
<i>And in that moment...</i>

819
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,490
<i>everything I knew to be true
about myself, was gone.</i>

820
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,011
<i>I was acting like another woman...</i>

821
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,363
<i>yet I was more myself
than ever before.</i>

822
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,890
<i>We decided to spend Wednesday
away from Winterset...</i>

823
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,128
<i>away from Madison County.</i>

824
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,769
<i>Away from pastures and bridges
and people too familiar...</i>

825
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,361
<i>and reminders too painful.</i>

826
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,044
<i>We let the day take
us where it wanted.</i>

827
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,611
Oh, is that India? It's beautiful.

828
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,691
Oh, look at this one.

829
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,166
Look at their expressions.
So beautiful.

830
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,807
As if the camera isn't on them.

831
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,723
They're not photographs,
they're stories.

832
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,563
You should have these published.
You should have your own collection.

833
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,806
Nobody'd buy it.

834
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,411
Why do you say that?

835
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,771
Six publishers have told me so.

836
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,769
No big deal.

837
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,610
Whatever it is...

838
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,282
that makes an artist look like
an artist to the world...

839
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,921
is just a feature I
don't have, that's all.

840
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,083
Maybe you have to
convince yourself first.

841
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,606
Maybe.

842
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,721
Maybe you have to ask yourself
why it's an obsession.

843
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,525
What's that?

844
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,490
I remembered I had this the
other night, after you left.

845
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,366
It was made for me in Assisi.

846
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,482
My aunt gave it to me
for my 7th birthday.

847
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,444
"Francesca."

848
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,887
Keep it.

849
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,521
<i>A musician friend of
Robert's told him...</i>

850
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,563
<i>of a place off the interstate.</i>

851
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,244
<i>A place, Robert assured me,
no one I knew would see us.</i>

852
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,966
Thank you.

853
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,280
Thank you.

854
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,125
Cheers.

855
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,201
What were you like
when you were younger?

856
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,400
Trouble.

857
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,571
- Why?
- I just wondered.

858
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,569
Why were you trouble?

859
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,444
I had a temper.

860
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:25,284
What were your parents like,
your mother and father?

861
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,891
I don't know if I can
do this, you know.

862
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,127
What?

863
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:40,287
Try to cram in a whole lifetime
between now and Friday.

864
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,762
- Where'd you go?
- Bar in town.

865
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,011
Have you called Betty?

866
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,770
Well, maybe you should.

867
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,803
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.

868
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,965
Remember the Delaneys
from Hillcrest Road?

869
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,170
Yeah, but I thought she died.

870
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,646
He remarried. Lucy Redfield.

871
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:24,003
Apparently, they were
having an affair for years.

872
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,329
The first Mrs. Delaney
was a bit of a stiff.

873
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,400
You mean...

874
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,730
she didn't like sex?

875
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,764
Mom could have helped.

876
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,286
Oh.

877
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,685
Oh, boy!

878
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:48,483
All these years I've resented not living
the wild life in someplace like Paris.

879
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,161
And all the time I could
have moved back to Iowa.

880
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,211
Are you drunk?

881
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,606
Not yet.

882
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,245
Oh.

883
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,202
You wanna get out of
here for a while?

884
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,410
I think I'd better.

885
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,963
I'll take the keys.

886
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,050
I'm driving.

887
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:35,524
I've never cheated on Betty.
Not once we were married, I mean.

888
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:40,401
- Did you want to?
- Only about a thousand times.

889
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,484
What do I do now?

890
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,690
What's good enough for Mom
is good enough for me?

891
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,684
What gets me...

892
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,331
is I'm in my forties.

893
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,526
I've been in this crummy frigging
marriage for over 20 years...

894
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,451
because that's what I was
taught. You stick things out.

895
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,210
Normal people don't get divorced.

896
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,802
I can't remember the last time my
husband made love to me so intensely...

897
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,401
that he transported me to
Africa, for Christ sake.

898
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,927
Quite frankly, I don't
think he ever did.

899
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,881
Now I find out that in between bake
sales, my mother was Anais Nin.

900
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,326
What about me?

901
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,127
I feel really weird.

902
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,927
Like she cheated on me,
not Dad. Isn't that sick?

903
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,250
When you're the only son
you sort of feel...

904
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,610
like the prince of the kingdom. In
the back of your mind, you think...

905
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,526
your mother shouldn't want sex
anymore because she has you.

906
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,043
You're right, that is sick.

907
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,170
If she was so unhappy,
why didn't she leave?

908
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,086
Can I...

909
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,850
read it now?

910
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,608
Did I miss anything important?

911
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,251
Well...

912
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,531
She just took him up to her room.

913
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,330
Dad's room?

914
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,961
All right, you can skip
that part. Let's just start...

915
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,361
here.

916
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,411
"Robert lay asleep in the bed.

917
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,487
I was up all night that night.

918
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,602
What happens tomorrow?

919
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,649
By the end of that day he will leave
and everything new and unknown...

920
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,207
that had become so familiar...

921
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,567
<i>...would be gone."</i>

922
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,490
Did you sleep well?

923
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,966
Thanks.

924
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,606
Good.

925
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,841
- More coffee?
- Sure.

926
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,447
I hope you don't mind my asking,
but I feel like I should.

927
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,725
What?

928
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,847
These women friends of yours all
over the world, how does it work?

929
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:07,648
Do you see some of them again,
or do you forget others?

930
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,608
Or do you write to some
of them now and then?

931
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,162
- How do you manage it?
- What do you mean?

932
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:20,760
I just need to know the procedure,
so I don't upset your routine.

933
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,446
Want some jam?

934
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,483
What are you talking about?
Routine? There's no routine.

935
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,644
Is that what you think this is?

936
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:32,489
Well, what is this?

937
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,849
Well, is it up to me?

938
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,726
You're the one who's married and you have
no intention of leaving your husband.

939
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,280
To do what?

940
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:49,202
Go off with someone who needs
everyone, but no one in particular?

941
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,250
What would be the point? Will
you pass me the butter, please?

942
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,283
I was honest with you.

943
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,524
Yes. Absolutely.

944
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,606
You have this habit of not needing,
and that's very hard to break.

945
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,885
In that case, why sleep?
You don't need rest.

946
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,441
Why eat? You don't need food.

947
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,045
What are you doing?

948
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:21,250
Gee, I don't know. Maybe I'm not
cut out to be a world citizen...

949
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,006
who experiences everything and
nothing at the same time.

950
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,282
How do you know what I experience?

951
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,601
- I know you.
- Oh?

952
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,486
What can this possibly mean to
someone who doesn't need meaning...

953
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:38,805
who just goes with the mystery,
pretends he's not scared to death?

954
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,610
Let's stop this right now.

955
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:44,242
After you leave, I'll have to sit
here for the rest of my life...

956
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,201
and wonder what happened to me,
if anything happened at all.

957
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,402
I'm gonna have to wonder if
you're gonna be sitting...

958
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,762
in some housewife's
kitchen in Romania...

959
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:59,126
telling her of your world of good friends,
and you secretly include me in that group.

960
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,044
What do you want me to say?

961
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:05,530
I don't want you to say anything.
I don't need you to say anything.

962
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,008
I want you to stop this now.

963
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,091
Fine.

964
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,483
More eggs? Or shall we fuck on
the linoleum one last time?

965
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:18,811
- I'm not gonna apologize for who I am.
- No one asked you to.

966
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,568
- I won't feel like I did anything wrong.
- You won't me made to feel, period!

967
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,122
You've carved yourself a part
in the world as a voyeur...

968
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,931
a hermit, a lover when
you feel like it.

969
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:35,491
The rest of us are supposed to feel
grateful for this... Go to hell!

970
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,891
It isn't human not to
be lonely and afraid!

971
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,441
You're a hypocrite and a phony!

972
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,482
I don't want to need you.

973
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,685
Why?

974
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,646
Because I can't have you.

975
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,041
What difference does that make?

976
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,251
Hm?

977
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,365
Don't you see?

978
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:21,009
Robert, don't you see?
I just have to know the truth.

979
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,166
I have to know the truth,
because if I don't, I'll go crazy.

980
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,769
So just tell me, either way.

981
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,607
I can't act like this is
enough because it has to be.

982
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,363
And I can't pretend not
to feel what I feel...

983
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,682
because it's over tomorrow.

984
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,882
If I've done anything...

985
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,251
to make you think that...

986
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,882
what we have between us
is nothing new for me...

987
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,002
is just some routine...

988
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,681
then I do apologize.

989
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,246
What makes it different?

990
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,761
It's just when I...

991
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,530
When I think...

992
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,041
of why I make pictures...

993
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,690
the only reason I
can come up with...

994
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:21,211
It just seems that I've
been making my way here.

995
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,089
Seems right now, that all
I've ever done in my life...

996
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,567
was making my way here to you.

997
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,891
And if I have to think about
leaving here tomorrow...

998
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,571
without you...

999
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,011
Don't let go.

1000
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,571
Oh, my God, what are
we going to do?

1001
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,284
No. Where's your truck?

1002
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:31,285
It's out behind the barn.
I'll go...

1003
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,285
upstairs.

1004
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,406
Hi!

1005
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,968
- Hi, Madge.
- I made some brown betty.

1006
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,242
Sent Floyd off to town
with the boy. I said:

1007
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,411
"I'm gonna visit my girlfriends, spend
the afternoon, that's all there is to it."

1008
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:02,291
He said, "Who's gonna
make lunch?" I said:

1009
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,524
"I'm taking a sick day.
Eat at the diner."

1010
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:09,448
Isn't that hilarious? He
didn't dare raise an eyebrow.

1011
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:13,446
I don't even want to tell
you how late he was out.

1012
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:18,203
Sorry two days passed before I came by.
With the boy home, time escapes me.

1013
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,489
Have you heard from Richard?
How's the fair? God, it's hot.

1014
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:24,166
Yes. It's hot.

1015
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,531
Come with me.

1016
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,129
Come away with me.

1017
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,491
Care for a beer?

1018
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,001
No.

1019
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,081
You're not coming with me, are you?

1020
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,127
No matter how many times I
turn it over in my mind...

1021
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,287
it doesn't seem like
the right thing.

1022
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,485
For who?

1023
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,530
For anyone.

1024
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:51,125
They'll never be able to
live through the talk.

1025
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,010
And Richard...

1026
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:03,042
Richard will never be able
to get his arms around this.

1027
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:10,528
It will break him in half.
He doesn't deserve that.

1028
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,366
He's never hurt anyone
in his whole life.

1029
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:19,683
He can move on. People move.

1030
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,650
His family has had this farm
for over a hundred years.

1031
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,245
Richard doesn't know how
to live anywhere else.

1032
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,444
And my kids...

1033
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,765
They're practically grown. You said
yourself they hardly talk to you.

1034
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,923
Yeah, they don't say much.

1035
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,688
But Carolyn is only 16.

1036
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:54,127
She's about to find out about
all of this for herself.

1037
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,601
She's going to fall in love...

1038
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:00,203
and she's going to try to
build a life with someone.

1039
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,050
If I leave...

1040
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,089
what does that say to her?

1041
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,290
What about us?

1042
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,484
You have to know...

1043
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,570
deep down...

1044
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,485
the minute we leave here,
everything will change.

1045
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:28,405
Yeah, it could...
It could get better.

1046
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:33,601
No matter how much distance we put
between ourselves and this house...

1047
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,642
I carry it with me.

1048
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:42,244
I feel it every minute
we're together.

1049
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,164
And I will start to blame loving
you for how much it hurts.

1050
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,924
And then, even these...

1051
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,080
even these four...

1052
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:58,769
beautiful days will seem just like
something sordid and a mistake.

1053
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:00,730
Francesca.

1054
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:05,164
Do you think that what happened
with us just happens to anyone?

1055
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,442
What we feel for each other?

1056
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,730
We're hardly...

1057
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,171
hardly two separate people now.

1058
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,564
Some people search all their
life for this and never find it.

1059
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:23,525
Others don't even think it exists.

1060
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,328
You're going to tell me...

1061
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:31,890
You're going to tell me this is the
right thing to do? Giving it up?

1062
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:38,040
We are the choices that
we have made, Robert.

1063
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,765
You don't understand.

1064
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,651
Don't you see?

1065
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:53,248
Nobody understands when
a woman makes a choice...

1066
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:55,801
to marry and have children...

1067
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:01,610
in one way, her life begins,
but in another way, it stops.

1068
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:06,207
You build a life of details...

1069
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:10,367
and you just stop
and stay steady...

1070
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:14,042
so that your children can move.
And when they leave...

1071
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:17,602
they take your life
of details with them.

1072
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:22,608
You're expected to move on, but you
don't remember what moved you...

1073
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:26,561
because no one's asked you in
so long, not even yourself.

1074
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,767
Oh, but you never think...

1075
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,047
You never think love like this
is going to happen to you.

1076
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,089
But now that you have it...?

1077
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:45,923
Well, now I want to
keep it forever.

1078
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:50,802
I want to love you the way I do
now for the rest of my life...

1079
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,244
but if we leave...

1080
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,005
we lose it.

1081
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,203
And I can't make an
entire life disappear...

1082
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,244
to start a new one.

1083
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,364
All I can do is try
to hold on to us...

1084
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,489
somewhere inside of me.

1085
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,848
You have to help me.

1086
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,324
Don't lose us.

1087
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:27,404
Don't throw us away.

1088
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,124
Maybe you feel this way.
Maybe you don't.

1089
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,651
Maybe it's because
you're in this house.

1090
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:45,165
Maybe tomorrow, when they come
back, you'll feel differently.

1091
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,091
- Don't you think that's possible?
- I don't know.

1092
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,921
Look, I'm going to be
here a few more days.

1093
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,443
We can talk later. We
don't have to decide now.

1094
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,011
Robert, don't. Don't do this.

1095
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:05,607
I don't want to say
goodbye right now.

1096
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,361
We don't have to
make that decision.

1097
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,328
Maybe you'll change your mind.

1098
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,885
Maybe we'll see each other
and you'll change your mind.

1099
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,931
If that happens you
have to decide...

1100
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,406
because I can't.

1101
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,403
I'll only say this once.

1102
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,928
I've never said it before.

1103
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:13,686
But this kind of certainty comes
but just once in a lifetime.

1104
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:18,126
Look!

1105
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:35,445
- You got it.
- I couldn't sell him.

1106
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,325
I know. I knew you would win.

1107
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,603
- Good girl. Proud of you.
- Thanks.

1108
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,325
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, darling.

1109
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,767
- Did you eat?
- Yeah. I ate.

1110
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,929
Hey, there. How you doing?

1111
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:52,004
It didn't take you too
long to get here.

1112
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:54,447
- No.
- Three hours, what?

1113
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:58,040
- We really had fun.
- Are you hungry?

1114
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,049
I got something for you.

1115
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,489
The fair was great.

1116
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:12,008
<i>You all came home.</i>

1117
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,526
<i>And, with you...</i>

1118
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,240
<i>my life of details.</i>

1119
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,808
<i>A day or two passed, and
with each thought of him...</i>

1120
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,964
<i>a task would present
itself like a lifesaver...</i>

1121
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:31,761
<i>pulling me further and further
away from those four days.</i>

1122
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,729
<i>I was grateful.</i>

1123
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,968
<i>I felt safe.</i>

1124
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:48,370
<i>Put me out of my misery.
I can't stand the suspense.</i>

1125
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,568
<i>I'm not talking about you.</i>

1126
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:53,923
<i>I know I'm a goner. I can't
stand the suspense. Shoot.</i>

1127
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:56,202
<i>I don't even need a blindfold.</i>

1128
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:00,126
<i>Condemned man's dinner.
Chicken, peas, watermelon.</i>

1129
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,208
Do you want anything special?

1130
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,681
How about that brown
sugar meat loaf?

1131
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,325
Okay.

1132
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,529
<i>For a moment, I didn't
know where I was.</i>

1133
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:33,160
<i>And for a split second, I thought
that he didn't really want me.</i>

1134
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,847
<i>That it was easy to walk away.</i>

1135
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:20,161
<i>Robert leaned over as if to get
something from the glove box.</i>

1136
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:24,046
<i>Eight days ago, he'd done that...</i>

1137
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:27,051
<i>and his arm had brushed
across my leg.</i>

1138
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:31,203
<i>A week ago I'd been in Des
Moines, buying a new dress.</i>

1139
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,888
That truck's a long way from home.

1140
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,243
Washington State.

1141
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:09,009
I'll bet it's that photographer
they talked about over at the cafe.

1142
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:17,447
Boy, what's he waiting for?

1143
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:51,600
Come on!

1144
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:19,130
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1145
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,767
<i>The words were inside of me.</i>

1146
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:29,408
<i>"I was wrong, Robert. I was
wrong to stay, but I can't go.</i>

1147
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:32,484
<i>Let me tell you again
why I can't go.</i>

1148
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:39,090
<i>Tell me again why I should go."</i>

1149
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:42,449
<i>I heard his voice
coming back to me:</i>

1150
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:47,249
<i>"This kind of certainty comes
but once in a lifetime."</i>

1151
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:53,605
What's wrong, Franny?

1152
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,411
Will you please tell me
what's wrong with you?

1153
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:07,322
I just need a minute, Richard.

1154
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,562
I just need...

1155
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:26,808
<i>And now for the farm report.</i>

1156
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:30,841
<i>Some areas reporting an
increase in wind activity...</i>

1157
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:14,322
- Dad, you bought the wrong feed!
- What?

1158
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,168
<i>I was grateful for the
silence that night.</i>

1159
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:47,086
<i>I realized love won't
obey our expectations.</i>

1160
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:50,922
<i>Its mystery is pure and absolute.</i>

1161
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,329
<i>What Robert and I had...</i>

1162
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:56,285
<i>could not continue
if we were together.</i>

1163
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,647
<i>And what Richard and I shared
would vanish if we were apart.</i>

1164
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:05,124
<i>But how I wanted to share this!</i>

1165
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:10,170
<i>How would our lives
have changed if I had?</i>

1166
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:14,201
<i>Could anyone else have
seen the beauty of it?</i>

1167
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:19,125
Hi.

1168
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,084
I'm Francesca Johnson.

1169
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:23,164
And I...

1170
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:28,925
I feel awful that I haven't come to
visit you sooner. Is it a bad time?

1171
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:31,891
Am I interrupting anything?
Is it too late?

1172
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:34,168
No, not at all.

1173
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:37,963
<i>"We became inseparable, Lucy and I.</i>

1174
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:44,160
The funny thing is, I didn't tell
her about Robert until years later.

1175
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,080
But for some reason,
being with her...

1176
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,283
somehow made me feel...

1177
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,922
it was safe to think about him...

1178
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:57,449
to continue loving him.

1179
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:03,241
This town loved talking about the
two of us, but we didn't care.

1180
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,203
And neither did your father."

1181
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:09,726
It's time, huh?

1182
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:11,247
Mm.

1183
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,884
There. That's it.

1184
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:27,320
Yeah?

1185
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:31,451
Is better?

1186
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,605
Is better.

1187
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,200
Franny.

1188
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:13,327
I just want to say...

1189
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:19,202
I know you had your own dreams.

1190
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:25,329
I'm sorry I couldn't
give them to you.

1191
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,884
I love you so very much.

1192
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,282
<i>After your father died...</i>

1193
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:08,042
<i>I tried to get in touch with Robert,
but he had left the National Geographic.</i>

1194
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,801
<i>No one seemed to know where he was.</i>

1195
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:15,489
<i>My only connections to him were the
places that we'd been to on that one day.</i>

1196
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:19,048
<i>And so, each year on my birthday...</i>

1197
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:20,765
<i>I'd revisit them.</i>

1198
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:32,127
<i>Then one day, I received a
letter from his attorney...</i>

1199
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:33,850
<i>with a package.</i>

1200
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:21,484
<i>There has not been a day since
that I have not thought of him.</i>

1201
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:27,248
<i>When he said we were no longer
two people, he was right.</i>

1202
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:33,530
<i>We were bound together as
tightly as two people can be.</i>

1203
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,682
<i>If it hadn't been for him...</i>

1204
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,720
<i>I don't think I would have lasted
on the farm all those years.</i>

1205
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:47,885
<i>Remember that dress of
mine you wanted, Carolyn?</i>

1206
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:51,285
<i>The one you said I never wore?</i>

1207
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:54,284
<i>I know I was silly...</i>

1208
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:59,321
<i>but to me it was as if you were asking
to wear my wedding dress to the movies.</i>

1209
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,169
<i>After reading all this...</i>

1210
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:09,485
<i>I hope you can now understand
my burial request.</i>

1211
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:12,889
<i>It was not the ravings
of some mad old lady.</i>

1212
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:16,562
<i>I gave my life to my family.</i>

1213
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,088
<i>I wish to give Robert
what is left of me.</i>

1214
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:21,800
Hey, Dad.

1215
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,049
Can I talk to you?

1216
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,846
You've been gone all night long. Do I even
have the right to ask where you've been?

1217
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:38,401
Do I make you happy, Betty?

1218
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:40,324
Because I want to.

1219
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,722
More than anything.

1220
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,684
Hi, Steve. It's me.

1221
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:58,446
Good. You?

1222
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:02,081
Listen, we have to talk.

1223
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:04,444
Well, how about now?

1224
02:08:05,480 --> 02:08:07,642
Uh, no...

1225
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:11,331
I've decided I'm gonna
stay here for a while.

1226
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,683
I don't know how long.

1227
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:18,325
No, I'm not angry, Steve.

1228
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,123
I'm not.

1229
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,522
I'm not angry at all.

1230
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:27,851
<i>I gave Lucy his photography book.</i>

1231
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:31,050
<i>If you are interested, take a look.</i>

1232
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:34,927
<i>If my words still leave
some things unclear...</i>

1233
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:38,130
<i>perhaps his pictures
can illuminate.</i>

1234
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:42,446
<i>After all, that's what
an artist does best.</i>

1235
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:53,288
<i>I love you both...</i>

1236
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,522
<i>with all my heart.</i>

1237
02:08:56,760 --> 02:09:00,446
<i>Do what you have to
to be happy in this life.</i>

1238
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:04,090
<i>There is so much beauty.</i>

1239
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:08,045
<i>Go well, my children.</i>
