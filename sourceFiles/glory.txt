1
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,317
One! One!

2
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,569
One, two, one!

3
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,779
One! One!

4
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:54,616
One, two, one!

5
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,534
Dear Mother:

6
00:01:56,743 --> 00:02:00,246
I hope you are keeping well
and not worrying too much about me.

7
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:03,291
You mustn't think that any of us
are going to be killed...

8
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:08,171
...for they are collecting such a force
here that an attack would be insane.

9
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,050
The Massachusetts men
passed through here this morning.

10
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,637
How grand it is to meet the men
from all the states, east and west...

11
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,014
...down here ready
to fight for their country...

12
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,099
...as the old fellows did
in the Revolution.

13
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,854
<i>But this time we must</i> make <i>it</i>
a <i>whole country...</i>

14
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:29,108
...for all who live here,
so that all can speak.

15
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,737
Before this war began...

16
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,199
...many of my regiment
had never seen a Negro.

17
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:39,661
Now the roads are choked
with the dispossessed.

18
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:45,041
We fight for men and women
whose poetry is not yet written...

19
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:49,879
...but which will presently be
as enviable and as renowned as any.

20
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:54,550
Last night we heard
of yet another defeat.

21
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,594
But we are not disheartened.

22
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:59,889
I am honored to be part
of such a splendid company.

23
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:03,643
They have made me captain,
of which I am enormously proud.

24
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,355
You would think it strange to see me
giving orders to a hundred men...

25
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,440
...most of whom are older
than I am.

26
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,528
Thank you for sending
my volume of Emerson.

27
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,239
His words come home to me
like truth.

28
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:21,452
'A deep man, ' he says, 'believes
that the evil eye can wither...

29
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,163
...that the heart's blessing
can heal...

30
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,291
...and that love
can overcome all odds.'

31
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,754
My dearest love to Father.

32
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,174
Your son, Robert.

33
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,195
Company, forward!

34
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,575
- Charge!
- Fire!

35
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,208
Fire!

36
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:10,960
Ready, men?

37
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,966
Fire!

38
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,219
- Aim!
- Aim!

39
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,222
- Fire!
- Fire!

40
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,567
Stand. Fire!

41
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,239
Steady, boys!

42
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,622
- Forward!
- Fire!

43
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,004
Fire!

44
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,385
Forward, men! Forward!

45
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:04,222
For God's sake, come on!

46
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,271
Fire!

47
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,616
Robert, come on!
We must fall back!

48
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,285
No! Forbes!

49
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,288
Forbes!

50
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,895
Charge!

51
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,374
You all right there, captain?

52
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,009
Please! Not my leg!

53
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,678
- Where's the chloroform?
- Stop!

54
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,638
Stop!

55
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,935
No! Wait!

56
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:41,480
- No!
- Hold on!

57
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,401
So it's the neck, right, captain?

58
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,903
Well, the surgeons are all busy,
but I'll fix you up.

59
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,113
All right, I'll just--

60
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,948
- Let me know if I hurt you.
- Stop!

61
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,284
Oh, this is nothing.

62
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,121
- Heard the latest?
- What's that?

63
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,790
Well, I heard it from a friend
who's a dispatch rider...

64
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:04,378
...who got it from a friend who's one
of Stanton's clerks in the War Office.

65
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,506
He says Lincoln is gonna issue
an emancipation proclamation.

66
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,509
Gonna free the slaves.

67
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,927
What?

68
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,388
Maybe not in the border states
or something...

69
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,766
...but he's gonna free
some of them, anyway.

70
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,642
- My God.
- Yeah.

71
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,645
Would've done it sooner,
only he was waiting on a big victory...

72
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,606
...which is, I guess, what this is.

73
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,525
Oh, my God!

74
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,528
Please don't cut anymore, please!

75
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,739
Please!

76
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,033
This might hurt you, captain.
I'm sorry.

77
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,868
Thank you.

78
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,816
Dashing.

79
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,760
- Robert.
-Thomas.

80
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,597
Captain Shaw.
I was so proud when I heard.

81
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,976
Well, they had no choice.
All the other officers are dead.

82
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,895
- And Forbes?
- Impossible, as always.

83
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,523
He's around here somewhere.

84
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,732
How about you?

85
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,777
Working for your father,
helping him with the resettlement...

86
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:53,821
...for the Freedmen's
Relief Association.

87
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,614
There's a shortage of housing.

88
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,867
Robert! Are you all right?

89
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,619
Yes. I'm sorry.

90
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,916
Robert! Darling, there's someone
who wishes to meet you.

91
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,461
General Hunter rounded up
a bunch of slaves from the fields...

92
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,840
...called them "contraband"
and put them in camps like cattle.

93
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,927
Then the War Department decided
to issue them pikes rather than guns.

94
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,555
Of course they deserted.
So would I.

95
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:20,639
Robert.

96
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,391
Governor, you know my son Robert.

97
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,936
- Yes, good to see you again, Robert.
- Governor Andrew.

98
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,231
Robert, have you met
Frederick Douglass?

99
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,405
Mr. Douglass.

100
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,659
I understand you were at Antietam.

101
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,246
Yes.

102
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,084
A great and a terrible day.

103
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,506
Well, I could use your help, Robert.

104
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,927
The governor is proposing to raise
a regiment of Negro soldiers.

105
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,597
No, no. It was not just my idea.
Mr. Douglass and some of us--

106
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,850
We will offer pride and dignity...

107
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,228
...to those who have known
only degradation.

108
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,939
Colored soldiers, Robert.
Just think of it.

109
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,190
Wonderful.

110
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,984
I've submitted your name
to be commissioned colonel...

111
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,446
...of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry.

112
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:28,999
Thank you, governor. That's--
It's a wonderful idea.

113
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,921
Excuse me.

114
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,178
- Well done, Shaw.
- Well done, captain.

115
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:44,640
- Splendid job, young man.
- Bravo, Robert.

116
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,369
What's the matter, chester?
Too much punch?

117
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,543
I mean, I know how much
you'd like to make colonel...

118
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,753
...but a colored regiment?

119
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,760
You know how popular
that would be?

120
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:25,097
Handing out guns
to a thousand coloreds?

121
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,357
Hey, Robert.

122
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,360
What's wrong?

123
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,784
I'm gonna do it.

124
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,749
You're not serious.

125
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,251
Yeah.

126
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,798
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?

127
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,801
And you?

128
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,726
Can you picture me
in charge of a regiment?

129
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,815
Picture me in charge of anything?

130
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,109
I would be honored to have you.

131
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,824
Well, then you're an idiot.

132
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:31,830
Rob, is it true?
There's to be a colored regiment?

133
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,416
So it seems.

134
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,627
Then I am your first volunteer.

135
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,182
Present arms!

136
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,603
How do we look, colonel?
We gonna whup the Seoesh?

137
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:56,313
Boss, when do we get the blue suit?

138
00:14:56,522 --> 00:15:00,150
- Yeah, the blue suit.
- Yeah.

139
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,784
- Ready to whip them Rebs.
- Ready, colonel!

140
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,870
- When are we gonna get to fight?
- Yeah!

141
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,706
Are we really gonna get to fight
this time?

142
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,971
Attention!

143
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,891
- Morning.
- Morning.

144
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,272
Good morning, gentlemen.

145
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,192
I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.

146
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,236
I am your commanding officer.

147
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,076
It is a great pleasure
to see you all here today.

148
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:56,999
It is my hope
that the same courage...

149
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:03,046
...spirit and honor,
which has brought us together...

150
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,716
...will one day restore this Union.

151
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,929
May God bless us all!

152
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,182
Yeah!

153
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,937
Form companies?

154
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,273
We will commence
with forming companies.

155
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:24,067
Company officers, take charge.

156
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:29,406
You recruits will report
to your respective officers...

157
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:34,369
...by the letter of your company
in alphabetical order...

158
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:39,124
...which is in the top left-hand corner
of your muster sheet.

159
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,479
- Good book, brother?
- Yes, it is, actually.

160
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,981
Name's Searles. Thomas Searles.

161
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,776
Jupiter Sharts, sir.
What it about, that book?

162
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,653
It's a collection of essays actually.

163
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,448
Fourier, Emerson,
all the transcendentalists.

164
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:15,035
- It got pictures?
- No.

165
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,913
- Teach me?
- Yes, I'd be happy to.

166
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,429
Will you look at what's
walking in here! Look at them.

167
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,933
I'd rather have a hog than a nigger.
At least you could eat the hog!

168
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,019
Getting dark mighty early
around here.

169
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,317
Come on! Show us a little dance,
will you, boys?

170
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,421
Sergeant of the guard,
post your sentry.

171
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,298
Yes, sir!

172
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,218
Right there!

173
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,970
Shoulder!

174
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:19,057
Right file, right. March!

175
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,060
Wait, no.
See, that's my space, nigger.

176
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,062
I sleep better close-up on that door.

177
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:28,775
If you don't mind, I'd prefer a space
with more sufficient reading light.

178
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,236
Oh, I like it when niggers
talk good as white folk.

179
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,617
I'd be happy to teach you.
It would be my pleasure.

180
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,704
Hey, look here, snowflake, I ain't got
nothing to learn from no house nigger.

181
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,832
I am a free man,
as was my father before me.

182
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,167
- Oh, you free, nigger?
- Yes.

183
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,587
Good. Why don't you move
your free black ass before I bust it up?

184
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,214
- Hey, hold up, buck.
- Nobody said nothing to you, pap.

185
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,759
It's all right.

186
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,094
I'll be fine over here.

187
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,472
Excuse me.

188
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,019
Wonder when they gonna
give us the blue suit.

189
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,773
Ain't give no blue suit to no black
soldiers. Blue suits for the whites.

190
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,108
Well, we soldiers now.

191
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:15,113
- Where you from, field hand?
- South Carolina.

192
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,450
South Carolina? Well, you ought
to know better than that, boy.

193
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:23,038
Hey, would you quit that?
Say, boy, quit that drumming.

194
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,707
Hey, hey, hey-

195
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,843
What's your name, boy?

196
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,889
I said what's your name, boy?

197
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,101
- Can't you see that he's mute?
- He what?

198
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,144
He's mute.

199
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,273
You mean this child can't talk?

200
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,153
Hey, come over here, hon.

201
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,285
Dummies and field hands.
Ain't that a bitch?

202
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,996
What about you there, buck?
Whereabouts are you from?

203
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,459
I'm from around Tennessee.

204
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,754
Ran away when I 12 years old,
I ain't never looked back.

205
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,173
Wh--? What you doing since then?

206
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,884
I've run for president.

207
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,183
I didn't win though.

208
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,986
Boy.

209
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,745
Come on, give us some food, man.

210
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,634
Major? Forbes?

211
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:00,927
That's you.

212
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,262
- Thomas.
- Hello.

213
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,639
- How are you?
- You know Charlie Morse.

214
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,057
- Charlie.
- Thomas Searles.

215
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,852
- Hello.
- Cabot.

216
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,147
So how was your meal?

217
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,274
The rémoulade was a trifle tart...

218
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,152
...but the soufflé for dessert
more than made up for it.

219
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,780
And your comrades?

220
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,993
Charming. Extraordinary
conversationalists, every one.

221
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,037
Major Forbes.

222
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,247
A word, please.

223
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,958
Oh, excuse me, Thomas.

224
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,256
Yes, Robert?

225
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,259
I won't permit
that kind of fraternization.

226
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,722
-It's only Thomas.
- He's an enlisted man.

227
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,434
You're right, of course.

228
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,479
I've sent for help.

229
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,065
These men need a proper teacher.

230
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,485
For God's sakes, men, you march
like a bunch of crippled old goats!

231
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:02,113
Jesus Christ, we're gonna be here
day and night until we get this right.

232
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,824
One, one!

233
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,367
Company, halt!

234
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,744
About-face!

235
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,290
You are ugly Mexican,
African fucking whores!

236
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,168
We're gonna work on this
day and night, gentlemen.

237
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,796
Forward at the half step. March!

238
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,507
One. You half-wit black bastard.

239
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,717
Is it true they cut your balls off
at birth?

240
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:26,513
I'm gonna work on you, you bastard,
until I get you broken.

241
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,223
Company, halt!

242
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,059
For God's sake, do you not know
your right from your left?

243
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,144
No, no, no, sir.

244
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,315
How many here do not know
right from left?

245
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,903
Jesus, have pity.

246
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,738
This is your front!

247
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:47,117
This is your rear!
This is your right! And this--

248
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,662
Now you're learning, boyo.

249
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,373
Company, forward, march!

250
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,834
One, one, one.

251
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,002
"Two!
'one!

252
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,086
"Two!
'one!

253
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:58,879
"Two!
'one!

254
00:22:59,087 --> 00:22:59,838
"Two!
'one!

255
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,047
"Two!
'one!

256
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,424
"Two!
'one!

257
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,218
You bloody Hindus, get it right!

258
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:09,347
Stop. Start it again.
In each rank. Count!

259
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:14,102
Left. Left, right, left.

260
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,271
Right, on my word, march.

261
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:20,567
Left-- Get your goddamn hand
out of your pocket, soldier!

262
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,070
Left. Left, right, left.

263
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,072
Oh, look at this.
Bonnie Prince Charlie.

264
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:29,284
Are you a gentleman? Are you
a member of congress, or something?

265
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,369
Or are you the bloody
prince of Africa?

266
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,247
Don't look at me! Look straight
ahead! Look straight ahead!

267
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,624
I'll eat your ass up, boyo.

268
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:39,502
You know, the Irish are not noted
for their fondness for the coloreds.

269
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,922
What about the uniforms?

270
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,382
Still no word.

271
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,384
The rifles?

272
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:50,096
- Left. Left, right left.
- See to it.

273
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,390
You're a big buck.
You're tough, aren't you?

274
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,186
You've got a lot to learn.
You haven't had a master like me.

275
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,479
Dear, Mother.

276
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,023
<i>The men learn very quickly.</i>

277
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,692
Faster than white troops,
it seems to me.

278
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,987
They are almost grave
and sedate under instruction...

279
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,531
...and they restrain themselves.

280
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,410
But the moment
they are dismissed from drill...

281
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,540
...every tongue is relaxed
and every ivory tooth is visible.

282
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:21,044
And you would not know from the
sound of it that this is an Army camp.

283
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,423
<i>They must have had to learn this
from long hours of meaningless...</i>

284
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,967
...and inhuman work.

285
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,345
To set their minds free so quickly...

286
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,347
...it gives them great energy.

287
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,933
And there is no doubt
that we will leave this state...

288
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,269
...as fine a regiment as any
that has marched.

289
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,897
As ever, your son, Robert.

290
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,321
They've done it.

291
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,451
Assemble the men.

292
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,663
Attention!

293
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,957
Battalion!

294
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:07,841
In accordance with
President Lincoln's wishes...

295
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,760
...you men are advised...

296
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:15,473
...that the Confederate Congress
has issued a proclamation.

297
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,519
It reads:

298
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,024
"Any Negro taken in arms...

299
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:27,027
...against the Confederacy...

300
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:31,156
...will immediately be returned
to a state of slavery.

301
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:37,495
Any Negro
taken in Federal uniform...

302
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,832
...will be summarily put to death.

303
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:51,051
Any white officer
taken in command of Negro troops...

304
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,847
...shall be deemed as inciting
servile insurrection...

305
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,601
...and shall likewise
be put to death."

306
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:09,986
Full discharges
will be granted in the morning...

307
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,072
...to all those who apply.

308
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:19,454
- Dismissed.
- Dismissed.

309
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,333
If you're not here in the morning...

310
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,336
...I understand.

311
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,721
Still want that blue suit, nigger?

312
00:27:57,177 --> 00:28:00,638
- Good morning, major.
- Sir. Formed and ready, sir.

313
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,724
How many are left?

314
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,813
Attention!

315
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,150
Battalion!

316
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,503
Glory hallelujah.

317
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,214
One. One, two, one.

318
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:37,592
One, one. One, two, one.

319
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,677
Company, halt!

320
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,685
You're not dismissed, boyo!
Get up!

321
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:51,564
You'll fall out when I say
and not before. Do you understand?

322
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,650
I said, get up!

323
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,693
Sergeant major.

324
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,787
- Sir.
- At ease, sergeant.

325
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,710
I have no doubt
that you are a fair man, Mulcahy.

326
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,715
I wonder if you are
treating these men too hard.

327
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,053
You disagree?

328
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:27,642
- You may speak freely.
- The boy's your friend, is he?

329
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,644
We grew up together, yes.

330
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:33,439
Let him grow up some more.

331
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,612
- I see.
- Will that be all, sir?

332
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,532
Yes.

333
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,535
Dismissed.

334
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,748
- Order.
- Order.

335
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,016
Fifty-seven caliber Enfield rifle musket.
Best in the world here, boy.

336
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,767
Sharts.

337
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,853
"11911."

338
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,480
Think you can handle that, boy?

339
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,774
Shit, I can knock something down
with this.

340
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,276
Trip.

341
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:21,779
"12192."

342
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:25,199
- Beautiful.
- Hawkins.

343
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,411
"12186."

344
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:30,788
- Jefferson.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,832
Robert.

346
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:36,210
Finally.

347
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,795
There's a rumor going around...

348
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,757
...that we're to be used
only for manual labor.

349
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,176
I can't believe
the kind of things we hear.

350
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,931
It's not true, is it? I mean,
about not being allowed to fight.

351
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:53,519
The men are all living for that day.
I know I am.

352
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,816
- Fletch.
- Don't bother about him.

353
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,819
- He's just ignorant.
- Excuse me.

354
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,557
For God's sake, come on!

355
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,852
Good shot, man.

356
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:37,688
Do that again. Here, give him
your weapon. Give him that.

357
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:38,856
Do that again.

358
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,692
- One dime, he can't do it.
- Dime? Dime on each of you.

359
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,820
- I want money.
- That's a bet.

360
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:47,448
- Go on, boy.
- Go ahead. Go ahead, Sharts.

361
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:56,499
- That's a dime on each of you!
- Double or nothing!

362
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,838
Attention, company!

363
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,091
Attention, company!

364
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,884
As you were.

365
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,846
Front and center.

366
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,727
You're a good shot, private.

367
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,814
Thank you, sir. Squirrel hunting.

368
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,694
- You ever killed a man?
- No, sir.

369
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,196
- But you're handy with a gun.
- Yes, sir.

370
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,701
Reload.

371
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,418
Faster.

372
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,505
Faster.

373
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,924
Faster!

374
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,930
Discharge your weapon.

375
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,934
Discharge your weapon.

376
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,479
Do it!

377
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:05,276
Now do it again.
Only this time, I want it done quickly.

378
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:10,948
A good man can fire three aimed shots
in a minute.

379
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:16,537
Major Forbes,
give me your Colt revolver.

380
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,623
- What?
- Your gun.

381
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,834
Give it to me.

382
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,757
Faster.

383
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,842
Reload.

384
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,929
Quickly. Faster!

385
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,682
Faster! Load.

386
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,685
Faster!

387
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,981
Do it! Do it!

388
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,025
Do it!

389
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,069
Do it!

390
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,254
Teach them properly, major.

391
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:10,466
Yes, sir.

392
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,179
Attention, company!

393
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:20,184
Ready!

394
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,936
Aim!

395
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,021
Fire!

396
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,710
Good morning, major.
You're up early.

397
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,962
I wanna talk to you.

398
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,047
Certainly.

399
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:54,760
If you wouldn't mind
getting down from your horse.

400
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,984
Better?

401
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:13,571
Why do you treat the men this way,
Robert?

402
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,283
How should I treat them?

403
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,493
Like men?

404
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,584
And what about Thomas?
Why are you so hard on him?

405
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,839
He's not a very good soldier.
I'm getting these men ready for battle.

406
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:35,718
Robert, they're already as good
as the Seventh ever was.

407
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,429
- They march well. They're disciplined.
- No thanks to you.

408
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:41,265
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

409
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:46,312
Who do you think you are,
acting the high-up colonel?

410
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,440
You seem to forget, I know you...

411
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,400
...and so does Thomas.

412
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,198
Forbes.

413
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,202
If you don't believe in
what we're doing here...

414
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:05,581
-...maybe you shouldn't be part of it.
- Part of what?

415
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:12,129
Left, right, left, right, little finger
along the seams of your trousers?

416
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,467
Marching is probably all
they'll ever get to do, Robert.

417
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,179
It is my job...

418
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:24,058
...to get these men ready.

419
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,893
And I will.

420
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,605
They have risked their lives
to be here.

421
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,315
They have given up their freedom.

422
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,150
I owe them as much
as they've given.

423
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,403
I owe them my freedom...

424
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,780
...my life, if necessary.

425
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:40,616
Maybe so do you, Cabot.

426
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,494
I think you do.

427
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,173
Develop! Guard!

428
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,676
Thrust! Develop!

429
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,594
Guard! Thrust!

430
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,888
Develop! Guard!

431
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,349
You're not at dancing school, son.
Take his head off.

432
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:07,643
Thrust! Develop!

433
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:08,978
Guard!

434
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,188
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
what have we here?

435
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:14,233
Bonnie Prince Charlie
and his little toy bayonet.

436
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:18,028
You're not reading your books now.
Go on, go on, get over there.

437
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,990
- Now stab me.
- What?

438
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,033
Stab me.

439
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,622
Come on, stab, not tickle. Hit me.

440
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,207
Come on!

441
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,917
You prissy little schoolgirl.

442
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:35,129
You're the worst soldier
in this whole company. Now hit me!

443
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,724
No shame, son. Get up.

444
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,228
I said, get up.

445
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:53,647
Nigger forgot to duck. That's all.

446
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,233
Sergeant, deal with that man.

447
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,700
Let me tell you a wee secret, son.

448
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:08,412
The only thing you're to learn
to do is to keep your mouth shut.

449
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:13,250
Save it, son. Save it.

450
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,253
Carry on, Sergeant Mulcahy.

451
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,757
- First rank to the rear. Back to work.
- Robert. Robert.

452
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:25,554
I'd like to speak to you
for a moment in private, if I may.

453
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:33,354
Enlisted men wishing to speak
to their commanding officer...

454
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,439
...must first get permission.

455
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,359
You understand, private?

456
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,281
Yes, sir.

457
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,034
Guard! Thrust!

458
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,036
Develop! Recover!

459
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,998
Thrust! Develop! Recover!

460
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,918
Thrust! Develop! Recover!

461
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,213
En garde!
Thrust! Develop! Recover!

462
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:02,258
You better put some oomph
into that, boyo!

463
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,517
Oh, my, my, my-

464
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,019
Some things never change.

465
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:17,231
I guess the whole world
hate the nigger.

466
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,441
Boy, if you don't quit
that drumming in here...

467
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,280
Honey, why don't you take your drum
on outside and practice?

468
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,744
That Colonel Shaw, he a hard man.

469
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:35,165
Yeah, swell.
Just a nigger-beating swell.

470
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,835
But he in the same boat with us.

471
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:41,297
Secesh come, take him, kill him too.

472
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:43,257
Not him.

473
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,092
He a swell.

474
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,845
He just a boy.

475
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:52,266
Yeah. He a weak white boy.

476
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,144
Beating on a nigger
make him feel strong.

477
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:58,647
Ain't that right, snowflake?

478
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,819
You know, he ain't never been
to no West Point...

479
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,738
...and the only reason
he in charge...

480
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,948
...is because
his mommy and daddy fixed it.

481
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:09,950
Ain't that so?

482
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,377
You thought he was different,
didn't you?

483
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,424
What you think now?

484
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:32,389
You just thought you was so smart,
didn't you, nigger?

485
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,976
Yeah, you in real school now
though, ain't you?

486
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,438
What you gonna do? Cry?

487
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,403
Yeah, he sure enough
learning now, ain't he?

488
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:50,950
- Sergeant, post your sentries.
- Yes, sir.

489
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,743
Attention, company.

490
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,495
Forward, march.

491
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:55,955
Right face.

492
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:57,915
Oh, shit.

493
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:03,420
Young man say there's a farm
ain't but two or three miles from here.

494
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:09,426
Said the lady over there
give him biscuits and gravy.

495
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,015
She said, if he bring his friends,
she feed them too.

496
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:19,019
- Don't even think about it.
- What you say, buck?

497
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:22,398
Biscuits and gravy sound good to me.
Maybe get myself some real shoes.

498
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:26,443
I'm telling you, boy.
They find out, they liable to shoot you.

499
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,446
Nigger, is you an old man
or is you an old woman? I forget.

500
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,449
All right.

501
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,248
Collard greens.

502
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,461
Corn bread.

503
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,844
Come on, dream.

504
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:55,180
I'm waiting on you.

505
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,148
Throw it over here.

506
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,484
Dear, Mother.

507
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,404
News today of the defeat
at Fredericksburg.

508
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:14,491
<i>If things continue to go badly,
I wonder if I might not end my days...</i>

509
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:17,911
<i>...as an outlaw leader
of a band of fugitive slaves.</i>

510
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:22,374
Try as I may,
I don't know these men.

511
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,085
Their music, their camaraderie...

512
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,504
...which is different from ours.

513
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:31,592
<i>I am placed in</i> a <i>position where,
if I were</i> a <i>man of real strength...</i>

514
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,886
<i>...I might do</i> a <i>great deal.</i>

515
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:37,347
But I am afraid I shall show
that I am not of much account.

516
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:42,019
I don't want to stand in their way
because of my own weakness.

517
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,730
<i>I miss Christmas
on the Shaw Island...</i>

518
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,690
...and the smell of the sea.

519
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:49,902
Robert.

520
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,530
It's Thomas.

521
00:42:58,077 --> 00:43:00,204
I just wanted to say...

522
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:09,171
I wanted to say...

523
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:14,676
Merry Christmas, Robert.

524
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,556
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

525
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,596
You're Shaw, aren't you?

526
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,848
Merry Christmas.

527
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,975
Kendric, division Quartermaster.

528
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:05,519
This sorry piece of work is Haggis.

529
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,187
He writes vouchers.

530
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:09,064
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

531
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:13,443
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, very well. Thank you.

532
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:17,614
That's all right. Brass are all up
to division, planning the next disaster.

533
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,783
You're among friends.

534
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:21,952
How much longer do you figure
they last?

535
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:24,872
I hear they're deserting,
10 at a time.

536
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,540
Oh, you're misinformed.

537
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,625
- We haven't had a single incident.
- See?

538
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,211
I figure the nigs
never had it so good.

539
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,630
Three square a day,
a roof over their heads.

540
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,467
And they gotta know that nobody's
gonna let them fight. Am I right?

541
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,180
Yes, of course.

542
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,099
Listen, if there's anything you need.

543
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:47,644
- A bottle for the cold nights?
- Yes, actually, I put in a requisition...

544
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:50,105
...for some shoes two weeks ago...

545
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:51,982
...and I haven't heard anything.

546
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:54,526
Well, provisionally speaking...

547
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,654
...we're extremely limited
as to footwear.

548
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:59,990
I'm afraid that kind of item
has to be reserved...

549
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,493
...for those units
whose fighting readiness...

550
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,496
...supersede yours.

551
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:07,956
You understand, I'm sure.

552
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,670
Yes, I understand.

553
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,222
- Excuse me.
- Oh, stop by tomorrow.

554
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,724
I have got my hands on
the most delicious local jam.

555
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:27,684
- Myrtle berry, isn't it?
- Blueberry.

556
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:29,853
Oh, right, right.

557
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,688
Nice meeting you, Shaw.

558
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,445
Twit.

559
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,622
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

560
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,708
We've caught a deserter.

561
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:09,101
Oh, lordy, this is bad.

562
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,478
They ain't gonna shoot him, is they?

563
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:13,021
No.

564
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,065
It'll be all right.

565
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:16,817
Won't it?

566
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,737
Re-form your ranks!

567
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,699
- Re-form your ranks!
- Re-form your ranks!

568
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:26,743
Fall in. Quiet in the ranks.

569
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:30,622
Quiet in the ranks!

570
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:34,543
Right. Untie his hands
and take off his coat.

571
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:38,755
The prisoner is in position, sir.

572
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:40,924
What is this?

573
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:43,927
The prisoner is to be flogged
before the entire regiment.

574
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:46,555
Robert, not with a whip.
Not on them.

575
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:52,519
- Excuse us, Sergeant Mulcahy.
- At your pleasure, colonel.

576
00:46:56,189 --> 00:47:00,319
Never question my authority
in front of others.

577
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:05,115
Well, I is sorry, massa. You be
the boss man now and all us chilluns...

578
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:09,286
-...must learn to obey.
- Major Forbes, stand at attention.

579
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:20,464
Sergeant Mulcahy.

580
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:24,801
You may commence.

581
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,819
Proceed.

582
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,533
Attention.

583
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:24,337
Mr. Rawlins.

584
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,009
This morning I--

585
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:35,849
It would be a great help
if I could talk to you...

586
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:38,310
...about the men from time to time.

587
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:48,528
That's all.

588
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:52,782
Shoes, sir.

589
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:04,711
The men need shoes, colonel.

590
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:08,256
Yes, I know. I've been after
the quartermaster for some time now.

591
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:11,176
No, sir. Now.

592
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,974
The boy was off trying to find hisself
some shoes, colonel.

593
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:20,977
He wants to fight...

594
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:23,605
...same as the rest of us.

595
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,775
More, even.

596
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,082
All of the men, like this?

597
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,001
Yes. Most of them.

598
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,685
Good afternoon, colonel.

599
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:04,938
You change your mind about
that bottle I was talking about?

600
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:08,233
I want 600 pair of shoes
and 1200 pair of socks...

601
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,944
...and anything else
you've been holding out on us.

602
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:13,029
Piece of rat filth.

603
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:15,824
I'd love to help you, colonel,
but we just don't have any.

604
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,117
Not for niggers, you don't.

605
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,954
- Not for anybody.
- I see. Pity.

606
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:24,249
I'll just have a look around,
see that you haven't misplaced them.

607
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,961
Hey.

608
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,046
Hey!

609
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:32,882
Son of a bitch!

610
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,260
- Damn it, you can't--
- Can't I?

611
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:38,680
I'm a colonel, nasty little cuss.

612
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:42,309
You really think you can keep
700 Union soldiers...

613
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:45,979
...without proper shoes
because you think it's funny?

614
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:50,984
- Where would that power come from?
- All right, all right. Calm down.

615
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,071
Look, have a drink.

616
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:09,169
Hey, you barefoot men,
come on out here!

617
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:10,712
Got something for you.

618
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:13,006
Shoes! Shoes!

619
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:14,758
Have a pair.

620
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:18,470
Here's a pair there.
One pair of shoes here.

621
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:23,725
Here's another pair.
One pair per customer.

622
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:02,347
Steward, is there
anything you need?

623
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,058
- No, sir.
- Keep me informed.

624
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:07,102
Yes, sir. I will.

625
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:17,904
Shoulder arms!

626
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:20,156
Sir.

627
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:22,409
From the War Department.

628
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,169
Can anything be done?

629
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:38,174
- They've got families.
- I know.

630
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:41,636
We'll protest this
through channels later on.

631
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,432
- Attention, battalion.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:51,187
Attention, battalion!

633
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:57,193
You men enlisted in this regiment...

634
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,155
...on the understanding...

635
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:03,825
...that you would be paid
the regular Army wage...

636
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,494
...of$13 a month.

637
00:54:06,703 --> 00:54:09,205
This morning I have been notified...

638
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,083
...that since you are
a colored regiment...

639
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:15,044
...you will be paid $10 a month.

640
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:16,796
That ain't fair. They said 13.

641
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:20,759
Regiment, fall out by company
to receive pay.

642
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:26,473
- Where you going, boy?
- To get paid.

643
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:29,100
Ten dollar, a lot of money.

644
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:33,229
Hey, pop, you fitting to lay down
for this too?

645
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:38,818
- Fall in!
- Fall in!

646
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,240
Hey. Hey, come on.
Where's your pride, now?

647
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:46,326
Make your mark right here.

648
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,662
- I can write my name.
- Then do it.

649
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:53,249
They give them $13, only gonna give
us but ten? You gonna go for that?

650
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:56,711
I mean, a colored soldier stop a bullet
just as good as a white one!

651
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,505
And for less money too!

652
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:02,258
Yeah. Yeah, Uncle Abe got hisself
a real bargain here!

653
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:04,636
- Hey, what you say, boy?
- That's right, slaves!

654
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:07,430
Step right up, make your mark.
Get your slave wages.

655
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:09,849
All you good colored boys,
go ahead and sign up.

656
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:12,435
That's right. Tear it up, tear it up.

657
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:15,438
Tear it up! Tear it up!

658
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:19,108
- Get back in line!
- Tear it up, tear it up!

659
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:22,278
Tear it up, tear it up!

660
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:28,243
Tear it up! Tear it up!

661
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:34,123
Tear it up, tear it up, tear it up!

662
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:39,420
Tear it up, tear it up,
tear it up, tear--

663
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,894
If you men will take no pay...

664
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:57,313
...then none of us will.

665
00:55:57,564 --> 00:56:00,525
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

666
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:03,611
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

667
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:06,072
Let's hear it for the colonel!

668
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:08,616
Yeah!

669
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:18,835
Attention, battalion!

670
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,253
Attention.

671
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:22,672
Attention.

672
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,801
Eyes right!

673
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:20,355
Eyes front!

674
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:28,154
Eyes“.

675
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,406
...right.

676
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:57,910
Mainly, I forgot how hot
it was down here.

677
00:58:58,119 --> 00:58:59,787
Welcome home, boy.

678
00:58:59,996 --> 00:59:03,291
Don't worry about it, buck.
Take a good look.

679
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:05,877
It's all a memory
now that the North man come.

680
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:08,713
Now that we come.

681
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:11,340
Colonel Shaw?

682
00:59:12,175 --> 00:59:15,511
Edward Pierce, special assignment
from Harper's Weekly.

683
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,139
- Harper's Weekly?
- Serving an entire nation.

684
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,349
Million readers want to know
what happens...

685
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:22,769
...when the men
of the 54th see action.

686
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:24,687
A million and one.

687
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:27,982
Well, you'll want to see this.

688
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:32,278
Attention, company!

689
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:35,531
- Rawlins, front and center.
- Sir!

690
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:41,537
Mr. Rawlins, this regiment
was formed with the promise...

691
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:44,999
...that only white officers
would be commissioned to lead it.

692
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:49,128
Nothing was mentioned, however,
about nonoommissioned officers.

693
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:53,549
Therefore, in recognition of initiative
taken not only for yourself...

694
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,969
...but on behalf
of the entire regiment...

695
00:59:57,303 --> 01:00:01,641
...you are hereby awarded the rank
of sergeant major.

696
01:00:07,522 --> 01:00:09,107
Congratulations.

697
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,194
- Thank you, sir.
- Hip, hip, hooray!

698
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:17,740
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

699
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:23,871
Congratulations.

700
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,749
I ain't sure I'm wanting this, colonel.

701
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:29,961
I know exactly how you feel.

702
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:46,727
Mama, they're coming home!
They're coming home!

703
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:02,493
That's right, hons. Ain't no dream.

704
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,996
We run away slaves,
but we come back fighting men.

705
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:09,167
Go tell your folks how kingdom come
in the year of jubilee!

706
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,283
Left. Up tight up there.

707
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,328
Left.

708
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,962
- Who are these ragamuffin?
- Contrabands, right out of the fields.

709
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:57,882
- Hey. Hey, old man, where from?
- Massachusetts.

710
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:01,344
Oona march better than we.
Oona march like the buckra soldier.

711
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:04,513
- I beg your pardon?
- He says we march like white soldiers.

712
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,891
Even talk like the buckra soldier.

713
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,518
- Where you from?
- Oh, round about here.

714
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:13,147
We were slaves in the field when the
Yankee man come. Say we soldiers.

715
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:14,857
How you like the Army, contraband?

716
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:18,152
Oh, we love it. We thank the Lord
every day for the good vittles...

717
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,238
...and these beautiful clothes.
Tell true.

718
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,323
This year, every day like Christmas.

719
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:25,368
- Like what?
- Like Christmas.

720
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:02,655
Splendid.

721
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:06,117
They've been working for weeks
in anticipation of your arrival.

722
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,661
We're all very excited
to have you here, Shaw.

723
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,955
- Thank you, sir.
- Lincoln's idea.

724
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,748
Hired a group of New Englanders...

725
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:15,626
...to teach our colored
how to read and write.

726
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:19,005
Just your sort of people,
I should think.

727
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:22,633
The regiment should enjoy
their stay here.

728
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:27,263
Yes, I'm sure we'll have a fine time,
but that's not why we're here.

729
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:32,393
Well, can't promise you much action.
Just having the coloreds around...

730
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:35,187
...seems to have scared the bejesus
out of the Rebs.

731
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:37,773
- Colonel Shaw?
- Excuse me.

732
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:40,776
I'd like you to meet
some of our instructors.

733
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,778
Dr. Thorpe of Salem.

734
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:45,031
-It's my pleasure, Colonel Shaw.
- Pleasure.

735
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:47,783
Dr. Rogers of Philadelphia.

736
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:51,495
- I know and admire your parents.
- You do, sir? Why, thank you, sir.

737
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:55,583
Shaw, meet Colonel Montgomery.

738
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,752
He's your brigade commander.

739
01:03:57,835 --> 01:03:59,754
- Colonel.
- Honored, sir.

740
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:02,965
Colonel Montgomery's
a real jayhawker from Kansas.

741
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:05,968
Contraband regiment
is his brainchild.

742
01:04:06,177 --> 01:04:09,513
You didn't think yours were the only
coloreds around, did you, colonel?

743
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:13,642
- I did, actually.
- Well, I'm sure they'll do just fine.

744
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:15,227
Have they seen any mischief?

745
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:16,812
No, sir.

746
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:21,817
I'm hiking a company over
to the Georgia coast in the morning.

747
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:24,820
We'll be foraging for supplies.
I could use a hand.

748
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:27,823
That is, if you think
your men are up to it.

749
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,619
They are indeed, sir.

750
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,662
Good. Very good.

751
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:36,248
- A pleasure.
- Good night.

752
01:04:36,457 --> 01:04:38,751
Beg to report, colonel, sir.

753
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:42,088
The troop is fed
and bedded down for the night, sir.

754
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:45,466
Very good, corporal.
Pass the word along to A company...

755
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,843
...we'll be going into action
in the morning.

756
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:52,431
Very good, sir.

757
01:05:06,654 --> 01:05:08,864
Your men march handsomely, colonel.
My compliments.

758
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:10,366
Thank you, sir.

759
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:13,744
I am surprised at how well
you handle them.

760
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:16,914
See, I am from Kentucky originally
and we owned a few ourselves...

761
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:19,291
...so it comes naturally to me.

762
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:23,796
- You are from Boston, are you not?
- Yes.

763
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:29,677
It is impossible to imagine
Boston with slaves.

764
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:47,903
Company, halt!

765
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:52,908
- Halt.
- Shoulder arms!

766
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:56,370
Town's clean, sir.
Ain't no Rebs here, just some women.

767
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:59,331
Well, all right. You hear that, boys?

768
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,876
Let's clear her out!

769
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:09,133
- What are you doing?
- Liberating this town...

770
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:11,927
-...in the name of the Republic.
- The musket, colonel?

771
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:13,304
Never shoot it. Shoot now?

772
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:16,599
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Go ahead.

773
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,435
Shoot the lady, boys!

774
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,941
- Don't shoot! We ain't Secesh here.
- That man is a civilian.

775
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:29,945
That man is Secesh,
and Secesh is all the same, son.

776
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:37,870
Look around you. You really think
anybody's gonna put these boys...

777
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:40,414
...into some real combat?

778
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:42,875
Do you?

779
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:46,712
They're little children.
Little monkey children.

780
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:49,423
You just gotta know
how to control them.

781
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:56,805
Please, let go! Oh, God!

782
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:59,975
You see what I mean? Children.

783
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:05,898
- Animal! Leave her alone!
- Hey, boy.

784
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:08,567
Take your hands off the white lady.

785
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:20,955
That would not have been necessary
if that Secesh woman hadn't started it.

786
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,957
They'll never learn.

787
01:07:23,582 --> 01:07:26,919
You see, Secesh has got to be
swept away by the hand of God...

788
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,213
...like the Jews of old.

789
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,299
And now I'll have to burn this town.

790
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:37,638
Nigger soldiers! Nigger soldiers!

791
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:41,725
Tell your men to set torches
and prepare to fire the buildings.

792
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:43,686
I will not.

793
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,648
That is an order.

794
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,318
You will do it or you will be
brought up on charges for disobeying.

795
01:07:51,569 --> 01:07:55,322
It is an immoral order, and by articles
of war I am not bound to obey it.

796
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:59,368
Well, you can just explain that
at your court-marital...

797
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:03,038
...after your men are placed
under my command.

798
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,595
First squad, second platoon.

799
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:21,974
Fall out to set torches.
Prepare to fire the town.

800
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:25,686
First squad, second platoon!
Fall out!

801
01:08:52,755 --> 01:08:55,049
Right face!

802
01:08:57,885 --> 01:08:59,970
Forward march!

803
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:03,098
Change the colors, sergeant major.

804
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:05,851
Change the colors.

805
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:09,021
What you looking at,
biscuit eaters?

806
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:11,899
You think you better than me?
You think you my judge?

807
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,817
You ain't nothing.

808
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:36,090
Dear Father, I need your help.

809
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:40,844
Despite my many requests,
it has become clear...

810
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:44,306
...that we are to be
used only for manual labor.

811
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,352
<i>Morale is low.</i>

812
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,147
The men's good humor
darkened by idleness and despair.

813
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:55,693
Why keep drilling if they are
never given the opportunity...

814
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:57,486
...to prove themselves?

815
01:09:57,695 --> 01:09:59,363
Attention!

816
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:02,950
I have written to Governor Andrew
as well as to...

817
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:04,702
...the general staff in Washington.

818
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:08,497
But I feel that only a letter
directly from you to Lincoln himself...

819
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:11,125
...can have the desired effect.

820
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:15,129
I can think of no other course.

821
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:19,216
I am sure you both pray,
as I do...

822
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:22,010
...that all this has not been in vain.

823
01:10:22,177 --> 01:10:24,138
Look like we going the wrong way.

824
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:27,641
Hey. Hey, come on, now.
Buck up, boys.

825
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:30,144
Hey, buck up, now. Come on.

826
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:33,188
See, someday they're gonna
let the 54th get into it, see?

827
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,190
And all your troubles
would be over, huh?

828
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:39,069
Come on now, cheer up. Hey.

829
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:41,697
What did you say, boy?

830
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:44,199
"Boy"? Let me tell you--

831
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:47,703
- Shut up, Trip--
- Would you get up off me, snowflake?

832
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,832
See, let me explain
something to you.

833
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:56,211
See, the way I figure, I figure this war
would be over a whole lot sooner...

834
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:00,215
...if you boys just turn right on around
and head on back down that way...

835
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:02,468
...and let us head
where the real fighting is.

836
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,344
Them men dying up that road.

837
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:08,223
And it wouldn't be nothing but
Rebs dying, if they let the 54th in it.

838
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:10,768
- Listen--
- Hold it!

839
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:14,521
As you were, Trip. As you were!

840
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:18,108
You men move on.

841
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:20,277
Stripes on a nigger.

842
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:22,905
That's like tits on a bull.

843
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,992
You're looking at
a higher rank, corporal.

844
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:29,286
Now, you'll obey and you'll like it.

845
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:31,789
- Make me.
- I'll make you.

846
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:35,000
- What the hell is going on here?
- Attention!

847
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:36,251
Attention!

848
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:40,380
You! Yes, you. What's your name?
I'm putting you up on charges.

849
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:44,134
- Oh, there ain't no cause for that, sir.
- What's that, sergeant?

850
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:47,387
Well, I mean, it's just
a soldiers' fight, sir.

851
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:53,393
- All right, you men move along.
- Front step! Forward! March!

852
01:11:53,602 --> 01:11:54,770
Move it!

853
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:59,274
You men get back to work.
Back to work! Let's go!

854
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:03,654
- We'll see you again.
- Go dig a latrine.

855
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:05,823
Go strum a banjo, boy.

856
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:07,282
Come on.

857
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:15,040
I've got the guard.
Let me use your looking glass.

858
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:19,294
Thank you.

859
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,174
Yeah, button up that collar.

860
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:26,844
Suck in that gut.

861
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:29,221
Tuck in them big, black lips.

862
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:31,932
Lighten your skin.
Shrink up that nose.

863
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,309
I don't have to listen to this.

864
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:38,063
Where you going, boy?

865
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:42,276
- Let me by.
- Let you by?

866
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:45,279
Let you by?

867
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,574
Let me tell you something, boy.

868
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:51,743
You can march like the white man.
You can talk like him.

869
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:54,621
You can learn his songs.
You can even wear his suits.

870
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:57,624
But you ain't never
gonna be nothing to him...

871
01:12:57,833 --> 01:13:01,879
...but an ugly-ass chimp
in a blue suit.

872
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:05,924
- Oh, you don't like that, do you?
- No.

873
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,720
Well, what we gonna do about it?

874
01:13:09,928 --> 01:13:11,889
Want to fight me, boy?

875
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:14,308
What you gonna do about it?

876
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,395
You want to fight me, don't you?

877
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:19,938
Don't you?

878
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:26,361
- Come on, nig.
- All right! All right!

879
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:28,322
Hey, get your hands off me,
gravedigger.

880
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,866
Does the whole world
gotta stomp in your face?

881
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:33,952
- Nigger, get your hands off me.
- Ain't no niggers around here.

882
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:36,371
So the white man give you
a couple of stripes...

883
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:40,125
...next thing you know, you ordering
everybody around like you the massa.

884
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:43,378
Nigger, you ain't nothing
but the white man's dog.

885
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:47,382
And what are you?

886
01:13:47,591 --> 01:13:50,385
So full of hate you just wanna go
and fight everybody...

887
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:52,846
...because you've been whipped
and chased by hounds.

888
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:55,390
That might not be living,
but it sure ain't dying.

889
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:59,394
And dying's what these white boys
been doing for going on three years.

890
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:03,065
Dying by the thousands.
Dying for you, fool.

891
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:05,400
I know, because I dug the graves.

892
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,611
And all the time I'm digging,
I'm asking myself:

893
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,447
"When? When, O Lord,
is it gonna be our time?"

894
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,617
Well, time's coming when
we're gonna have to ante up.

895
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:17,245
Ante up and kick in like men.
Like men!

896
01:14:19,414 --> 01:14:21,124
You watch who you call a nigger.

897
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,002
If there are any niggers
around here, it's you.

898
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:27,798
Smart-mouth, stupid-ass,
swamp-running nigger.

899
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:30,801
If you ain't careful,
that's all you ever gonna be.

900
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:36,431
You men go on back to business.

901
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:01,873
Shaw.

902
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:05,293
Sit down.

903
01:15:10,632 --> 01:15:13,635
Well, colonel,
what can I do for you?

904
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:18,640
You can give me and my regiment
a transfer to combat command.

905
01:15:19,558 --> 01:15:21,476
Couldn't do it, colonel.

906
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:23,895
You're much too valuable
to my operations here.

907
01:15:37,993 --> 01:15:39,119
May I sit?

908
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:43,790
Thank you. Major.

909
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:54,801
I've written a letter to my father...

910
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,888
...asking him
to press Governor Andrew...

911
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:00,515
...and President Lincoln.

912
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:02,851
But I don't have to wait for all that,
do I?

913
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:09,066
Colonel Montgomery, would you
bring that ashtray over here?

914
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:15,530
But valuable to your operations here,
do you say?

915
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:18,950
Your foraging, your depredations?

916
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:23,538
Yes, I've become quite a student
of your operations in this region.

917
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:26,750
Thirty-four mansions,
I think it was, pillaged and burned...

918
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:30,545
...under Colonel Montgomery's
expedition of the Combahee.

919
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:34,508
Four thousand bales of cotton
smuggled through the lines...

920
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:36,676
...with payment
to parties unknown...

921
01:16:36,885 --> 01:16:39,346
...excep'i by YOU-

922
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:41,431
False quartermaster requisitions.

923
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:43,308
Major Forbes here
has seen the copies.

924
01:16:43,517 --> 01:16:45,268
Yes, indeed.

925
01:16:45,477 --> 01:16:50,065
Along with confiscated valuables
shipped north as personal baggage.

926
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,235
Shall I go on?

927
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:55,695
Can you?

928
01:16:58,073 --> 01:17:01,076
I can report you
to the War Department.

929
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,580
Oh, yes. I can do that.

930
01:17:13,922 --> 01:17:18,343
Let you take your regiment
out to fight.

931
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:22,681
That's what you want, isn't it?

932
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,599
Show what they can do.

933
01:17:25,684 --> 01:17:28,979
- When?
- You are bright-eyed, aren't you?

934
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:30,856
When?

935
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:36,611
Just as soon
as I can write the orders.

936
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:42,993
Major.

937
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:55,714
Double-quick!

938
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:06,308
All right, company, in a line.
Double-quick!

939
01:18:07,184 --> 01:18:10,770
All right, men, form a firing line.
Over here.

940
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:13,648
Form a firing line right here.

941
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:27,954
Front rank, kneel!

942
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:31,374
Steady, boys!

943
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:39,507
Firing by battalion!

944
01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:43,470
- Aim!
- Aim!

945
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:45,680
Charge!

946
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:47,682
Fire!

947
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:59,402
Cease-fire! Recover!

948
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:21,091
Here they come!

949
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,729
- Reload!
- Reload! Load!

950
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:38,650
- Load it! Load it!
- Quickly, men!

951
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:40,944
- Ready!
- Ready!

952
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:44,447
- Aim!
- Aim!

953
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:46,741
Get ready. Get ready.

954
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,868
Fire!

955
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,381
- Reload!
- Reload!

956
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,508
Quickly.

957
01:20:03,717 --> 01:20:06,511
- Fire at Will!
- Fire at Will!

958
01:20:19,274 --> 01:20:20,275
Pour it in!

959
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,958
Charge!

960
01:21:48,488 --> 01:21:51,699
Look out, boy! Look out!

961
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:10,885
Fire!

962
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:26,651
They're turning tail!

963
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:34,909
Run, you Rebs!

964
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:41,040
Another victory!

965
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:46,045
Deploy skirmishers, captain.

966
01:22:46,254 --> 01:22:49,799
- Re-form your ranks!
- Re-form your ranks!

967
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,180
Fall in, on the double.

968
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:57,307
Form up! Form up!

969
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,521
- Let's do it.
- Skirmish lines.

970
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:06,983
Fall in! On the double!

971
01:23:08,735 --> 01:23:10,945
- Form company!
- Thomas.

972
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:19,370
How do, colonel?

973
01:23:21,331 --> 01:23:22,332
Hurts, doesn't it?

974
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,128
Well, I'm extremely jealous.

975
01:23:27,337 --> 01:23:29,422
You'll be back in Boston
before me...

976
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:31,716
...sitting by the fire,
reading Hawthorne...

977
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:34,052
...cup of decent coffee.

978
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,803
I'm not going back.

979
01:23:37,222 --> 01:23:41,976
Thomas, listen to me.
You're shot. You have to go back.

980
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:48,983
Robert, promise me...

981
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:52,111
...that you won't send me back.

982
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:56,491
Promise me.

983
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,119
All right.

984
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:02,789
All right.

985
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:29,774
Colonel Shaw!

986
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:32,026
- What is all this?
- You haven't heard?

987
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:35,280
Lee was turned back
in Pennsylvania at Gettysburg.

988
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:38,783
Now Grant's taken Vicksburg
and all on the Fourth of July.

989
01:24:38,992 --> 01:24:40,702
- My God.
- Yeah.

990
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:43,162
I know. it looks like it'll all be over
by Christmas.

991
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:46,291
- So how did they do?
- Splendid. Just splendid.

992
01:24:46,499 --> 01:24:48,960
- Any casualties?
- Forty-two.

993
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:51,963
Oh, give me the details. I'll wire it in.

994
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:54,299
I don't think we got
a prayer of making the paper.

995
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:56,801
I'll talk to you later in your tent.

996
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:15,069
As you were.

997
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:24,078
- Trip, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

998
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:28,666
You fought very well yesterday,
Trip.

999
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:32,420
Sergeant Rawlins has recommended
that you receive a commendation.

1000
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,089
Yes, sir.

1001
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:39,427
Yes, and I think you should bear
the regimental colors.

1002
01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:45,058
Well--

1003
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,727
It's considered quite an honor.

1004
01:25:52,106 --> 01:25:53,107
Why not?

1005
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:01,074
Well, I'm...

1006
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:06,663
Wanting to say something, sir,
but I...

1007
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,083
Go ahead.

1008
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:15,338
All right. See...

1009
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:20,843
...I ain't fighting this war...

1010
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:23,137
...for you, sir.

1011
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:26,265
I see.

1012
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:30,186
I mean, what's the point?

1013
01:26:31,145 --> 01:26:33,231
Ain't nobody gonna win.
It's gonna go on and on.

1014
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:36,150
- It can't go on forever.
- But ain't nobody gonna win.

1015
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:38,152
Somebody's gonna win.

1016
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:41,781
Who?

1017
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:47,495
I mean, you, you get to go on back
to Boston, big house and all that.

1018
01:26:49,414 --> 01:26:51,165
What about us?

1019
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:53,167
What do we get'?

1020
01:26:58,673 --> 01:27:00,675
Well, you won't get anything
if we lose.

1021
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:09,892
What do you wanna do?

1022
01:27:12,145 --> 01:27:13,187
I don't know, sir.

1023
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:16,941
It stinks, I suppose.

1024
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:18,735
Yeah.

1025
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:20,820
It stinks bad.

1026
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:24,615
And we all covered up in it too.
I mean, ain't nobody clean.

1027
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:33,207
Be nice to get clean though.

1028
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:36,919
How do we do that?

1029
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,762
We ante up and kick in, sir.

1030
01:27:48,556 --> 01:27:51,642
But I still don't wanna
carry your flag.

1031
01:27:56,606 --> 01:27:58,232
No one will ever take Charleston...

1032
01:27:58,316 --> 01:28:01,402
...without first silencing the forts
which protect its harbor.

1033
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:06,574
And the first one that must
be taken is that: Fort Wagner.

1034
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:10,953
Wagner mounts
a 10-inch Columbiad...

1035
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:13,790
...three smoothbore 32-pounders...

1036
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:16,167
...a 42-pound carronade...

1037
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,169
...a 10-inch coast mortar...

1038
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:21,297
...and four 12-pound howitzers...

1039
01:28:21,506 --> 01:28:24,634
...plus a garrison
of about a thousand men.

1040
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:27,261
As many of you gentlemen
may be aware...

1041
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:30,681
...for the last four days,
our Navy has weakened Wagner...

1042
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:32,850
...with a constant barrage.

1043
01:28:33,059 --> 01:28:36,270
Headquarters has determined
a time for our attack.

1044
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:39,273
We will proceed
with a direct frontal assault...

1045
01:28:39,607 --> 01:28:42,068
...tomorrow at dusk.

1046
01:28:42,276 --> 01:28:45,279
The problem, gentlemen,
is the approach.

1047
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,366
The ocean and the marsh
leave only a narrow strip of sand.

1048
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:52,578
A natural defile through which we can
only send one regiment at a time.

1049
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:56,290
Our best hope is that that leading
regiment can keep the Rebs occupied...

1050
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:59,836
...long enough for reinforcements
to exploit the breach.

1051
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:02,296
Needless to say...

1052
01:29:02,296 --> 01:29:05,508
...casualties in the leading regiment
may be extreme.

1053
01:29:07,301 --> 01:29:08,302
General Strong.

1054
01:29:10,972 --> 01:29:13,307
The 54th Massachusetts...

1055
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:16,602
...requests the honor of leading
the attack on Fort Wagner.

1056
01:29:26,654 --> 01:29:28,239
It's Colonel Shaw, isn't it?

1057
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:30,324
Yes, sir.

1058
01:29:31,242 --> 01:29:33,536
You and your men
haven't slept for two days.

1059
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:36,873
That's right, sir.

1060
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:39,458
You think they have the strength
to lead this charge?

1061
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:46,883
There's more to fighting
than rest, sir.

1062
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:50,344
There's character.

1063
01:29:51,345 --> 01:29:53,639
There's strength of heart.

1064
01:29:56,976 --> 01:30:00,354
You should have seen us
in action two days ago.

1065
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:03,566
We were a sight to see.

1066
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:08,571
We'll be ready, sir.

1067
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:12,074
When do you want us?

1068
01:31:24,981 --> 01:31:29,485
- Tomorrow, we go into battle.
- All right.

1069
01:31:29,694 --> 01:31:34,240
So, Lordy, let me fight
with the rifle in one hand...

1070
01:31:34,448 --> 01:31:36,450
...and the Good Book in the other.

1071
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:39,370
- Amen, brother.
- Amen.

1072
01:31:40,454 --> 01:31:44,834
That if I should die
at the muzzle of the rifle...

1073
01:31:45,835 --> 01:31:50,297
...die on water or on land...

1074
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:56,303
...I may know that you,
blessed Jesus Almighty, are with me.

1075
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:58,055
- With Jesus. With us.
- That's right.

1076
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:03,477
And I have no fear. Amen.

1077
01:32:03,477 --> 01:32:05,354
- Amen.
- Amen.

1078
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,707
Lord...

1079
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:27,501
...we stand before you
this evening...

1080
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:29,795
-...to say thank you.
- Thank the Lord.

1081
01:32:30,004 --> 01:32:31,505
We thank you, Father...

1082
01:32:31,505 --> 01:32:34,592
...for your grace
and your many blessings.

1083
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,177
Yes, sir.

1084
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:38,512
Now, I run off...

1085
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:43,517
...and left all my young'uns
and my kinfolk in bondage.

1086
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:46,645
So I'm standing here this evening,
Heavenly Father...

1087
01:32:46,854 --> 01:32:51,484
...to ask your blessings on all of us.

1088
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:56,530
So that if tomorrow
is our great getting-up morning...

1089
01:32:56,655 --> 01:33:00,242
...if tomorrow we have to meet
the Judgment Day...

1090
01:33:00,451 --> 01:33:04,538
...oh, Heavenly Father,
we want you to let our folks know...

1091
01:33:04,538 --> 01:33:06,540
...that we died facing the enemy.

1092
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:10,878
We want them to know
that we went down standing up--

1093
01:33:11,087 --> 01:33:12,546
Yes, Lord!

1094
01:33:12,546 --> 01:33:16,133
--Among those that are fighting
against our oppression.

1095
01:33:16,342 --> 01:33:18,344
We want them to know,
Heavenly Father...

1096
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:19,929
...that we died for freedom.

1097
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:26,185
We ask these blessings
in Jesus' name. Amen.

1098
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,270
- Amen.
- Amen.

1099
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:31,565
- Amen.
- Amen.

1100
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:42,618
Trip. Come on.

1101
01:33:42,827 --> 01:33:45,204
- No, I--
- You better get your butt up there, boy.

1102
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:50,209
Just say what you think.
Just say what you feel. Go on now.

1103
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:53,045
- Come on.
- Preach it, brother.

1104
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:56,841
Go on, let it out.

1105
01:33:58,217 --> 01:33:59,760
I ain't much about
no praying now.

1106
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:02,847
Well, you always say your piece.

1107
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:09,603
I ain't never had no family and...

1108
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:16,277
- Killed off my mama.
- Well...

1109
01:34:19,613 --> 01:34:21,615
This feels funny.

1110
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:23,617
- Come on.
-It's all right.

1111
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:27,621
Come on now. You're doing fine.

1112
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:34,378
Well, I just--

1113
01:34:42,094 --> 01:34:44,638
You know, y'all's-- Y'all's--

1114
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:48,726
Y'all's the onliest family I got.

1115
01:34:48,934 --> 01:34:51,645
Well, that's all right.

1116
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:54,315
And...

1117
01:34:59,111 --> 01:35:00,779
...I love the 54th.

1118
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:02,656
All right.

1119
01:35:10,956 --> 01:35:14,293
Ain't much matter
what happens tomorrow...

1120
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:15,669
...because we men, ain't we?

1121
01:35:15,836 --> 01:35:17,671
- Yes, sir.
- Amen.

1122
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:25,137
- We men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir.

1123
01:35:33,062 --> 01:35:35,940
- Shit.
- All right, man.

1124
01:36:35,582 --> 01:36:38,752
- Attention, company!
- Attention, company!

1125
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,046
Attention, company!

1126
01:36:41,255 --> 01:36:43,924
Attention, company!

1127
01:36:49,263 --> 01:36:53,142
Battalion, halt!

1128
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,531
We ready, colonel.

1129
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:46,111
Left. Left. Left, right.

1130
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:51,283
Left. Left. Left, right.

1131
01:37:51,492 --> 01:37:56,288
Left. Left. Left, right.

1132
01:37:56,914 --> 01:37:59,917
Left. Left. Left, right.

1133
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:04,254
- Give them hell, 54th!
- Give them hell, 54th!

1134
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:43,877
- Ready, fire!
- Ready, fire!

1135
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:47,881
- Ought to be quite a show, Pierce.
- Best seat in the house.

1136
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,677
I wonder if you might
do something for me.

1137
01:38:55,931 --> 01:38:58,767
I have some letters here.

1138
01:38:58,976 --> 01:39:00,018
Personal things.

1139
01:39:00,227 --> 01:39:01,728
Certainly, colonel.

1140
01:39:01,895 --> 01:39:05,315
Also, if I should fall...

1141
01:39:09,236 --> 01:39:10,696
...remember what you see here.

1142
01:39:12,906 --> 01:39:15,701
- Ready!
- Ready!

1143
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:17,244
- Fire!
- Fire!

1144
01:39:17,453 --> 01:39:18,912
- Fire!
- Reload!

1145
01:39:18,996 --> 01:39:20,706
- Reload!
- Fire!

1146
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:25,627
You men are relieved.

1147
01:39:25,836 --> 01:39:28,797
Report to the rear
as stretcher bearers.

1148
01:39:29,298 --> 01:39:31,425
- Do it now!
- Right face!

1149
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:34,595
Forward, march!

1150
01:39:38,724 --> 01:39:41,935
You go on, honey.
We be by directly.

1151
01:41:03,559 --> 01:41:05,727
Shaw!

1152
01:41:05,936 --> 01:41:07,854
Shaw!

1153
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:10,023
Shaw!

1154
01:41:14,444 --> 01:41:16,154
Shaw!

1155
01:41:16,363 --> 01:41:18,198
Shaw!

1156
01:41:50,606 --> 01:41:52,566
If this man should fall...

1157
01:41:54,526 --> 01:41:57,696
...who will lift the flag and carry on?

1158
01:42:03,201 --> 01:42:04,453
I will.

1159
01:42:06,663 --> 01:42:11,084
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

1160
01:42:18,008 --> 01:42:19,676
I'll see you in the fort, Thomas.

1161
01:42:36,068 --> 01:42:37,194
- Fix!
- Fix!

1162
01:42:37,402 --> 01:42:39,446
Bayonets!

1163
01:42:43,784 --> 01:42:46,119
- Shoulder!
- Shoulder!

1164
01:42:46,328 --> 01:42:47,829
Arms!

1165
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:55,128
'Charge!
'Charge!

1166
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:56,755
Bayonets!

1167
01:43:03,136 --> 01:43:06,807
- At the quickstep!
- At the quickstep!

1168
01:43:08,141 --> 01:43:09,810
Forward!

1169
01:43:11,144 --> 01:43:13,146
March!

1170
01:43:32,165 --> 01:43:34,000
Double-quick time!

1171
01:43:35,085 --> 01:43:36,294
March!

1172
01:43:45,303 --> 01:43:46,513
Steady, boys!

1173
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:22,758
Charge!

1174
01:44:40,442 --> 01:44:41,651
Come on!

1175
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:49,242
Forward!

1176
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:51,244
Forward!

1177
01:45:04,132 --> 01:45:05,258
Keep your ranks!

1178
01:45:14,267 --> 01:45:15,977
Take cover in the dunes!

1179
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:18,563
Take cover!

1180
01:45:54,599 --> 01:46:00,313
Company commanders, we'll wait here
and advance under cover of darkness.

1181
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,318
Men, get down over there!
Get down!

1182
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:11,324
Company commanders,
order your men to wait here!

1183
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,205
Get down!

1184
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:19,249
Get down!

1185
01:46:42,856 --> 01:46:44,691
- Sergeant Rawlins!
- Sir!

1186
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,860
Pass the word along!

1187
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:48,862
Forward on my command!

1188
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:50,530
Forward on my command!

1189
01:46:54,117 --> 01:46:55,577
Ready on the colors, men!

1190
01:46:55,869 --> 01:46:58,371
Forward on my command!

1191
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,248
Ready!

1192
01:47:03,835 --> 01:47:06,379
'Charge!
'Charge!

1193
01:47:16,389 --> 01:47:18,808
Forward, men! Forward!

1194
01:47:27,734 --> 01:47:30,403
Forward!

1195
01:47:33,406 --> 01:47:35,408
I've been hit!

1196
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:08,942
Forward! Forward, men!

1197
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:23,164
Come on, men, forward!

1198
01:48:29,796 --> 01:48:32,966
Come on, you men! Come on!
Don't stop! Get up there!

1199
01:48:51,484 --> 01:48:52,569
No!

1200
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:21,431
Come on!

1201
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:28,313
Come on, 54th!

1202
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:33,693
Robert!

1203
01:49:58,551 --> 01:50:00,136
Come on!

1204
01:50:11,564 --> 01:50:13,775
Charge!

1205
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:59,404
My eye!

1206
01:51:22,468 --> 01:51:24,554
Rally!

1207
01:51:24,637 --> 01:51:26,639
Rally!

1208
01:51:37,609 --> 01:51:39,652
- Form a firing line right here!
- No!

1209
01:51:40,862 --> 01:51:42,488
Get out of here!

1210
01:51:44,199 --> 01:51:45,658
Fire!

1211
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,664
Let's go! Move! Move!

1212
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:17,941
Come on! Come on!
