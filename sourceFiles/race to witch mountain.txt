1
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:53,374
<i>I've never seen that.</i>

2
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:57,344
<i>- Saucers...
- ... a dry lake bed.</i>

3
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,285
<i>- What's your status?
- Are you getting that on radar?</i>

4
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:11,087
<i>The government won't
admit UFOs are real because...</i>

5
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:13,390
<i>They're among us today.</i>

6
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:23,599
<i>Roswell, Gulf Breeze,
Area 51, Phoenix.</i>

7
00:01:23,638 --> 00:01:26,607
<i>Scientists believe UFOs
are visiting our planet.</i>

8
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,675
<i>- UFOs are real and they know it.
- Something happened.</i>

9
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:35,615
<i>- I know what I saw...
- Of course UFOs exist.</i>

10
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:46,551
<i>We were facing an alien threat
from outside this world.</i>

11
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:56,669
<i>If the United States Air Force
did recover alien bodies...</i>

12
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:59,037
<i>UFOs are as real as you and me.</i>

13
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:01,565
<i>Unless the military
proves me wrong,</i>

14
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,670
<i>what I saw was an alien spacecraft.</i>

15
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:18,149
<i>You felt a connection
to your heart.</i>

16
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:19,922
<i>And you heard directions in your mind.</i>

17
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:23,089
<i>We saw the alien spacecraft...</i>

18
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:41,545
<i>One UFO sighting.</i>

19
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,051
<i>There's more than meets the eye.</i>

20
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:48,886
<i>UFOs are manifesting themselves
to people.</i>

21
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:52,519
<i>What we're talking about
is the greatest cover-up</i>

22
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:55,155
<i>in the history of mankind.</i>

23
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,071
Object of unknown origin
is at 90-K and descending fast!

24
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,577
Get me a visual track now!

25
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:14,309
Zero match
with anything on our database.

26
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:15,714
It's maneuvering.

27
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:21,280
We're registering impact!

28
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:26,660
Get me Henry Burke. Now.

29
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:34,733
Hey. Do you think this is it?
It's the real deal, right?

30
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,570
You'll learn.

31
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:44,005
<i>This is not a drill.
Attention...</i>

32
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:49,544
Squad and equipment locked and loaded.
I re-routed local law and media.

33
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:52,417
Impact was eight minutes ago.
How long until we land?

34
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:37,390
Lmperial Droid,
drive your Geonosian starfighters

35
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:41,562
to Planet... Hollywood.

36
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:47,405
Die! Die! Whoa! Hey!
Give me... No! Come on!

37
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:14,762
Awesome.

38
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:23,700
Extend the perimeter.
No one gets in. Nothing gets out.

39
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,905
Planet Hollywood, please.

40
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:35,889
They've got everything here.

41
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:39,485
This place is truly
like being on another planet.

42
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:42,758
With all this to see every night,
you must never get bored.

43
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:55,469
Greetings...!

44
00:05:57,746 --> 00:06:02,342
- Welcome to the nutjob convention.
- I understand your reaction.

45
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:05,318
- They aren't helping our cause.
- Our cause?

46
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:10,281
Educating the public on the legitimate
possibility of life on other planets.

47
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:11,587
As a matter of fact,

48
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:14,459
I'm giving a lecture
on Astrophysical Anomaly Detection

49
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,020
at the nutjob convention.

50
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:19,929
Feel free to stop by.
Skeptics are always welcome.

51
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:22,163
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

52
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:29,139
Dr. Alex Friedman.

53
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:33,769
- Watch your backs, please.
- A classic.

54
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,669
Hey, come on!

55
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,806
Knock it off, will ya? I need to sleep!

56
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:09,373
Yeah, me too.

57
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,350
<i>Now, Channel 13 Action
News in high-definition continues.</i>

58
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:21,953
<i>Casey Smith, with a news alert.</i>

59
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:24,556
<i>- An accident near Searchlight.
- I'm Tricia Kean.</i>

60
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,159
<i>We're gonna take you to our reporter,
live on the scene.</i>

61
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:30,694
<i>Officials are calling it the
worst chlorine spill in state history.</i>

62
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:33,832
<i>A five-mile security perimeter
has been established.</i>

63
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,469
<i>Highway patrol officers
have been re-routing traffic</i>

64
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:39,071
since the early morning hours,
and we're now being told

65
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:42,810
this section of Route 95
will be closed indefinitely.

66
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,285
This is Natalie Gann reporting.

67
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:42,240
The casts we pulled out of the trench
indicate a distinct pattern

68
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:46,805
alternating between the depth
of the impressions here and here.

69
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:52,081
Suggesting not one, but two
separate EBEs. They were moving fast.

70
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,610
Bipedal...

71
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,121
...possibly humanoid in form.

72
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:03,660
Review every data-gathering
entity within a 50-mile radius,

73
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:08,135
starting upon impact.
Look out for any anomalies.

74
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:16,002
You guys gotta move this thing.
I gotta go. Come on.

75
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:17,807
Jack.

76
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:20,678
You don't return phone calls anymore?

77
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:22,706
Mr. Wolfe thinks you're being rude.

78
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,947
Well, tell Wolfe that when I said
it was the last time, I meant it.

79
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:29,718
Mr. Wolfe decides
when it's the last time. Not you, Jack.

80
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:33,784
He likes you, Jackie. Hates to see you
wasting your God-given driving talent

81
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:36,490
giving fat tourists cab rides
up and down the Strip.

82
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:38,965
Buddy, what kind of life is that?

83
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,160
It's one I'm late for.

84
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:49,243
- You got a death wish?
- I drive a cab in Vegas.

85
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:54,313
You're dead, Jack.

86
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:58,581
Hey! What are you doing?
Man, are you insane?

87
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:01,247
Move this out of the taxi zone
before I give you a ticket.

88
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:03,052
See you soon, Jackie.

89
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,544
- Where'd you come from?
- Outside.

90
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:29,880
I figured that part out on my own.
How'd you get in the car?

91
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:32,351
Through that portal.

92
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:33,945
I'm Seth. This is my sister, Sara.

93
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:36,252
We require transportation
services immediately.

94
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,087
Really? Well, I require...

95
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:41,459
- A currency transaction.
- Would this amount suffice?

96
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:44,761
- What, did you two rob a bank?
- Is this acceptable, Jack Bruno?

97
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,030
How'd you know my name?

98
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:51,368
If we have a deal for your services,
we must move forward rapidly.

99
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:53,533
It's urgent we get
to our destination without delay.

100
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:54,666
All right. I'm going.

101
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:57,139
Where to?

102
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,580
- I need an address.
- We must travel in that direction.

103
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,057
I'm gonna need something more specific
than just "that direction. "

104
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:14,790
We must locate latitude 40.54
cross-intersecting longitude...

105
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:17,024
We're gonna stick with "that direction. "

106
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:24,303
We tracked the two sets of EBE
footprints on and off for 7.3 miles,

107
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:26,397
losing them
at a rest stop off the highway.

108
00:11:26,441 --> 00:11:28,841
Four hours, 19 minutes
post-impact, there was

109
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:32,505
a highway patrol incident report
filed at... the exact same rest stop.

110
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:35,243
A car trunk was burglarized,
no signs of forced entry.

111
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:37,444
Give me something
better than that, Mr. Pope!

112
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:40,079
Stolen clothing
belonging to a couple of teenagers.

113
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,952
We're in the game. Let's roll with this.

114
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,514
Two kids don't
walk down the highway alone at night.

115
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,687
We got a bus. Landing roughly
at the same time, same rest stop.

116
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:49,320
Thirty-nine people exit.

117
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:52,355
Fast-forward to the passengers
re-entering the vehicle.

118
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,892
- Fast-forwarding.
- Stop. Rewind.

119
00:11:57,705 --> 00:11:59,070
Freeze.

120
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:01,433
There.

121
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:03,774
Looks like the bus
picked up some extra baggage.

122
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:06,439
Route schedule indicates next stop...

123
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:08,108
...Sin City.

124
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:10,674
I want access to
every single surveillance camera

125
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:13,209
Vegas has turned on.
Check office buildings,

126
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:16,155
warehouses,
restaurants, department stores.

127
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,385
Look in sewer systems if you have to.

128
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:22,385
ATMs! Freeman Street
and Main to be exact. 12:45PM.

129
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,333
Bank records indicate they withdrew...

130
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:30,769
...the entire contents of the machine.
Fifteen thousand dollars.

131
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,535
And also... they never used a card.

132
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:37,032
They never even
touched the machine. Not once.

133
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,809
These EBEs
possess some extraordinary skills.

134
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,908
Bingo! Here's the
cab company security camera.

135
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:46,579
Keep your eyes
on the back door of the cab.

136
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:50,520
Right there.

137
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:53,857
Synchronous satellite feed.
Get me a license plate.

138
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:56,358
Ground transport, now.

139
00:12:56,397 --> 00:13:00,231
And, no matter what
they appear to look like, gentlemen,

140
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:02,065
they're not children.

141
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:05,132
They're not even human.

142
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:23,746
Are your parents gonna be OK
with you guys spending all this money?

143
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,918
We have agreed upon a financial deal.

144
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,190
If your concern
is regarding compensation...

145
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:30,527
My concern is the fact
that I got a couple of kids

146
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,863
in the back of my cab
with a big wad of cash,

147
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,869
with a drop-off location
that's in the middle of nowhere.

148
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:39,304
In my book, that's a little chapter
called "running away. "

149
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,138
<i>Jack, you better be
getting desert miles on that fare.</i>

150
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:45,145
And they better be able to pay.

151
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,942
And yOu better get me an ETA!

152
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:49,575
<i>- Capisce?
- I'm losing reception, Dominick.</i>

153
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:50,914
<i>Jack? Jack!</i>

154
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,044
Oh, come on.

155
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:58,455
Jack Bruno, the vehicles behind us
are indicating a pattern of pursuit.

156
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:00,357
There's no vehicles following...

157
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:05,626
At your rate of speed versus theirs,
they will overtake our vehicle...

158
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,861
Relax, kid.
I'm just gonna let them pass.

159
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:21,379
Open road, people! It's all yours.

160
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:43,866
What did I tell you?
Nobody's following us.

161
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:46,168
- I'm the king of these roads...
- Jack Bruno!

162
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:01,813
I said I was out, and I meant it!

163
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,314
Who is Mr. Wolfe, Jack Bruno?

164
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:07,424
How do you know that...?

165
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,019
Get down, now!

166
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:38,088
Hold on.

167
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:44,492
He is just a cab driver, right?

168
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:52,870
Jack Bruno, it would appear
we have not eluded them.

169
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:55,637
I'm so over this.
Stay down! Stay down!

170
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,137
Seth, no. It's not a good idea.

171
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,512
- I have to try.
- It's too dangerous.

172
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:08,686
Look out!

173
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:25,835
Now what?

174
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:35,812
Get out! Get out!

175
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:40,647
Get out!

176
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,487
You two OK?

177
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,394
- We are...
- Fine.

178
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,456
We should just keep moving.

179
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:59,837
Stay here. You didn't get the message?

180
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:02,707
I told Frank and Marty I was out.

181
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:05,610
You tell Wolfe for me
that he's gonna pay for my repairs.

182
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:09,275
You are in way over your head here.

183
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:17,514
I want a complete profile on the driver.

184
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:20,857
- You think he's collaborating?
- Either way, he's a liability.

185
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,863
Get me some air transport.

186
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,969
How are you two
holding up back there?

187
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,334
We're fine.

188
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:32,532
I'm sorry I dragged
you two into all this.

189
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:35,406
There's no need
for you to apologize, Jack Bruno.

190
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:37,502
You're not always the one to blame.

191
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:41,012
But the urgency of our trip
has not decreased.

192
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:45,212
Don't worry. I'll get you two
where you need to go. You've earned it.

193
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:09,434
- We're here, Jack Bruno.
- Here? There's nothing here.

194
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:19,817
Somebody's
expecting you two, right?

195
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:21,981
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

196
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:26,049
Don't worry, Jack Bruno.
We'll soon be reunited with relatives.

197
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:31,223
OK. Seven hundred and 20 dollars
and 50 cents.

198
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:35,201
But after everything that went down
today, how about I knock off 25 percent.

199
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:36,260
- Here.
- I also...

200
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:43,537
OK, then. Goodbye to you, too.

201
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:47,942
Five hundred percent tip?

202
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:50,581
That's reasonable.

203
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,585
Hey! You guys overpaid!

204
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:04,328
By a lot!

205
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:14,432
Unbelievable.

206
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:28,378
Everything OK in there?

207
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:54,478
Hello?

208
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:16,961
What just happened?

209
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:20,633
Jack Bruno, you should not have
jeopardized your life by following us.

210
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:22,266
What sort of trouble are you in?

211
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:25,472
Return to your vehicle.
Your services are no longer required.

212
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:27,480
- He's trying to help.
- We don't need help.

213
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:32,247
Somebody's already been here looking for
it. We simply cannot trust any of them.

214
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:33,981
Just us, Sara.

215
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:38,283
We appreciate your efforts
to assist us, Jack Bruno.

216
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:41,658
But my brother is right.
We can involve you no further.

217
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:43,492
- Got it!
- Let's go!

218
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,863
- Hey. Just tell me what's going...
- This way.

219
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,925
Hurry up, Sara.

220
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:05,845
What is that?

221
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:15,925
Whoa, hey!

222
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:23,828
Don't go in the pimped-out fridge, Jack.

223
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:25,429
Hey!

224
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:42,514
What is this place?

225
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,744
<i>This way.</i>

226
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,817
Hey, hey. Hey.

227
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:02,334
<i>Hey!</i>

228
00:23:04,838 --> 00:23:05,862
Sara, it's here!

229
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:41,905
- What is it?
- It is what we came for, Jack Bruno.

230
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:44,911
Really? Is anyone else looking for it?

231
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:48,005
Say, the person
who trashed everything upstairs?

232
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:50,073
We think so. It is very valuable.

233
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:52,108
Which is why it was vital
that we locate it first.

234
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:55,417
What makes you sure whoever else
wanted it isn't still looking for it?

235
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:03,554
Shh! Shh! Go. Go. Go.

236
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:05,958
Go.

237
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,270
Run! Run! Run!

238
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:29,813
Ah!

239
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,388
Oh!

240
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:09,795
Ah!

241
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:16,767
- Jack Bruno!
- Kids!

242
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:28,543
Go, go, go, Sara!

243
00:25:35,422 --> 00:25:36,446
Come on.

244
00:25:43,497 --> 00:25:44,862
Jack Bruno!

245
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,501
Seth!

246
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:02,314
Ah!

247
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:09,522
Come on! We got to go! We got to go!

248
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:29,933
Seth!

249
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:38,183
- Seth!
- Keep moving! Keep moving!

250
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,218
Go, go, go, go!

251
00:26:50,197 --> 00:26:52,222
Ah! Let's go! Let's go!

252
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,304
Get in!

253
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:12,716
Ah!

254
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:34,271
How's your brother doing?

255
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:36,366
- His system has the ability...
- I will be fine.

256
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,038
It is important we gain much distance
from this location.

257
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,910
I'm happy you're feeling better,

258
00:27:40,947 --> 00:27:43,848
'cause you're gonna need
your strength when you explain

259
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:45,579
just what happened back there!

260
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:57,325
Here's the deal: The cab
doesn't move until your mouths do.

261
00:27:57,364 --> 00:28:00,458
- So start talking.
- The information you are seeking

262
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,764
is not within
your grasp of understanding.

263
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:06,000
We are dealing with issues
outside the realm of... your world.

264
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,529
Hey, I'm a cab driver, OK?

265
00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:10,509
I have had plenty of worldly experi...

266
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:12,910
Experiences.

267
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:16,547
Sara! We have to go!

268
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:22,755
What is it?

269
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,583
Hang on!

270
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:32,958
Hold on!

271
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,967
We can't let him destroy it, Sara.

272
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:13,801
Who is he?
And this time I need real answers.

273
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,138
- It's a Siphon.
- A what?

274
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:20,203
He's an assassin trained to pursue his
target until his mission is completed.

275
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:22,841
And his mission is?

276
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:27,316
Us.

277
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:34,220
Is there a safer route, Jack Bruno?

278
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,785
Not unless you know how to fly.

279
00:30:56,443 --> 00:30:58,240
Get down!

280
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:08,878
Jack Bruno!

281
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:17,459
Come on, come on. Hold it together!

282
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:21,295
Oh, come on!

283
00:31:22,502 --> 00:31:23,992
Faster! Faster!

284
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:26,635
It won't go any faster!

285
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:29,068
- Sara!
- Ah!

286
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:40,179
Hold on!

287
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:51,160
Watch out!

288
00:32:01,474 --> 00:32:05,410
Jack Bruno. In and out of juvie
and state pens since he was a kid.

289
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:07,140
Grew up poor in Midland, Texas.

290
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,241
Showed promise cutting his teeth
driving demolition derby and dirt track.

291
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:14,117
Ironically, at age 16,
his parents died in a car wreck.

292
00:32:14,154 --> 00:32:16,145
At 17 he ran away from his foster home

293
00:32:16,189 --> 00:32:20,683
and he headed to Las Vegas in the hopes
of going from stock car to NASCAR.

294
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:25,187
Instead he found work as a wheel man
for Andrew Wolfe, the Vegas crime boss.

295
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:28,325
His last bust was two years ago,
grand theft auto.

296
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:31,166
He got out, went legit,
and he's been driving a cab ever since.

297
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:33,365
Just spoke to
Jack Bruno's boss at Yellow Cab.

298
00:32:33,406 --> 00:32:36,034
Bruno took a fare
a significant distance out of the city.

299
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:39,443
Dispatcher claims he's been unable
to make contact for several hours.

300
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:41,242
Does the cab have a tracking device?

301
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:44,546
LoJack. Until it
stopped transmitting 28 minutes ago.

302
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:47,553
FOr SOme crazy reaSOn,
the laSt IOcatiOn waS On train trackS.

303
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:57,562
- No. We cannot trust him.
- I know we can, and we must.

304
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:04,995
Couple of kids, big wad of cash.
What could go wrong?

305
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,304
- You're frustrated, Jack Bruno...
- No.

306
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:19,444
No more "Jack Bruno this, Jack Bruno
that. " I've been asking for answers...

307
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:21,215
You know the answers, Jack Bruno.

308
00:33:21,254 --> 00:33:24,223
My brother and I
are indeed not from your planet.

309
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,128
That's it? So that's it? Mystery solved?

310
00:33:29,162 --> 00:33:31,596
You two want me to believe
that you're both aliens?

311
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:33,861
- It is the truth.
- Really?

312
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,629
Well, you don't look like aliens.

313
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:37,761
What does an alien
look like, Jack Bruno?

314
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:40,500
You know what aliens look like.
Little green people

315
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,772
with antennas and laser guns and,
"Take me to your leader, Earthlings. "

316
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:46,506
Ooh!

317
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:50,778
You require some sort of proof. He
thinks we're insulting his intelligence.

318
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:52,478
You think? You just can't drop

319
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:55,352
the "we're aliens" bomb
just like that on somebody.

320
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:57,879
I know I've seen some
pretty weird things today,

321
00:33:57,924 --> 00:34:00,119
but you can't expect me
to believe that...

322
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:10,661
I have the ability
to move objects with my mind.

323
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:13,968
- That's impossible.
- No, it's quite possible.

324
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:15,872
On our planet as well as yours.

325
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:18,969
You don't do it because you haven't
learned to use your full brain capacity.

326
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:23,005
No, I don't do it
because it's kind of creepy,

327
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:25,279
and I really would like you to stop.

328
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:32,017
Jack Bruno!

329
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:40,829
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on!

330
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:42,924
Come on!

331
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:48,440
Come on! Start! Start! Start!

332
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:14,030
Train engineer is banged up, but
alive. Last thing he saw in the tunnel

333
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:16,035
was our taxi and a set of flying lights.

334
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:18,230
He figured it must have
been a small plane.

335
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:20,933
Small plane? Whoa.

336
00:35:20,974 --> 00:35:23,772
You think there's a chance
there's a second ship?

337
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,405
You have the ability to fly at the speed
of light, yet you use a beat-up cab?

338
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:28,471
I don't think so.

339
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:30,949
Secure the site.
Catalog every piece of debris.

340
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:35,318
I want to know what's train,
what's cab and what's left.

341
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:14,526
- Hello! Anyone here?
- Yeah, we're closed!

342
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:16,756
Oh. There you are.
I know you're closed,

343
00:36:16,796 --> 00:36:19,321
but we've experienced
car trouble, I was hoping...

344
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:22,391
Still closed. Experience your
car trouble when we're open.

345
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:25,563
I'll work on that next time.
But this time I need you...

346
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:27,334
Jack Bruno.

347
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:30,308
The thing that will convince
Eddie Cortez to reopen for business

348
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:32,311
will be a significant amount of money.

349
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:36,307
Wait a minute. Do I know you?

350
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:39,113
No. Absolutely not.
You don't know them from anywhere.

351
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:41,620
I'll pay you double your rate.

352
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:43,349
- Why not triple?
- Done.

353
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:45,286
Huh?

354
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:50,861
What did you get in a fight with,
a rhinoceros?

355
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:55,196
- Poor rhino.
- Poor rhino! I know.

356
00:36:57,971 --> 00:36:59,996
I don't
even know where to start.

357
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:02,564
Where you could start
is replacing the front shocks

358
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:05,169
and the tie rods, patch up
the radiator, fix the exhaust,

359
00:37:05,211 --> 00:37:07,873
and if you have four tires,
I'll take those. You got one hour.

360
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:28,197
Come on.

361
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:40,204
Over here.
Come on, sit, sit. Sit down.

362
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:51,114
I hope you do not act upon
your thought of making a fast break

363
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:54,024
out of the back door of Ray's,
escaping Stony Creek,

364
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,687
never to look back at us again.

365
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:57,522
How do you know that?

366
00:37:57,563 --> 00:37:59,724
My sister also has
the gift of telepathy.

367
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:01,563
She can read the minds
of those nearest to her.

368
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:06,470
Really. You tell your sister that here,
on Earth, reading minds: Very rude.

369
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:08,337
Don't do that.

370
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:11,366
Hey, guys. Welcome to Ray's.

371
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:13,777
My name is Tina,
and I'm gonna be your server.

372
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:17,748
Wow. Look at the two of you.

373
00:38:17,784 --> 00:38:20,048
Uh, what do you mean,
look at the two of them?

374
00:38:20,086 --> 00:38:24,216
They look like just two
regular, innocent, all-American kids.

375
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:27,852
Who look like they just rolled around
in a pigpen right before dinner.

376
00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:30,055
- Evening, Tina.
- Sheriff Antony.

377
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:31,620
Your table's waiting for you.

378
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:33,894
I'm gonna send you
a round of Frito pies.

379
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,867
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, Tina.

380
00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:39,133
Why don't the two of you
come with me,

381
00:38:39,172 --> 00:38:43,700
- and we'll get you cleaned up.
- Hurry back.

382
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:53,617
- It's Jack.
- I've been trying you all night.

383
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:56,349
<i>Where are you?
You drop that fare yet?</i>

384
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:59,085
No, it's really,
really complicated right now.

385
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:02,720
Uncomplicate it.
I want my cab back. Spotless.

386
00:39:02,762 --> 00:39:06,596
Uh... Dominick, I got to go.
I got to go.

387
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:08,099
J...

388
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:12,002
- Got him! Stony Creek.
- OK. Get us ground transport.

389
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:14,165
I want a clean extraction in 20 minutes.

390
00:39:19,178 --> 00:39:20,805
You know, I think it would be...

391
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:23,441
Best for everyone
if Seth and I found another ride?

392
00:39:24,283 --> 00:39:26,274
Seriously, you got to stop doing that.

393
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:29,755
Jack Bruno, it is understandable
that you are scared and confused,

394
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:32,553
- considering all that has occurred.
- I'm not scared.

395
00:39:34,794 --> 00:39:36,193
Just a little confused.

396
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:40,188
But, the bottom line is,
you guys need someone from NASA

397
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:43,498
- or the Air Force, not me.
- If you abandon us now,

398
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:45,697
our mission will be in serious jeopardy.

399
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:48,571
Look, I'm just trying
to be honest here, OK?

400
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:52,044
- I'm the wrong guy.
- A wise human once said,

401
00:39:52,078 --> 00:39:53,773
"You are what you think you are. "

402
00:39:53,813 --> 00:39:55,838
Why don't you find that guy and ask him?

403
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:58,646
It was the Buddha. He's unavailable.

404
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:03,620
How is it that beings on your planet
can be so large in form,

405
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:05,487
yet feel so small inside?

406
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:10,795
Maybe you need help, too, Jack Bruno.

407
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:18,061
<i>- Dominick, I told you...
- Are they safe, Jack?</i>

408
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:25,571
<i>- Who is this?
- My name is Henry Burke.</i>

409
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:28,011
<i>I work within the Department of Defense.</i>

410
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:30,777
<i>I handle their more... sensitive cases.</i>

411
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:32,478
What do you mean, "sensitive?"

412
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:36,249
<i>I suspect we both know
the answer to that question.</i>

413
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:39,486
They're just kids. They don't
want trouble, and neither do I.

414
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:41,925
Good. Then we're all on the same page.

415
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:44,589
Trouble is
the last thing I want as well.

416
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,031
<i>But what I do want,
and I'm counting on you</i>

417
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:52,060
<i>to help me here,
are your two passengers.</i>

418
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:56,435
What are you gonna do with them?

419
00:40:56,475 --> 00:40:58,375
<i>Do you care this much about everyone</i>

420
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:02,404
<i>that gets into your cab?
You're a convicted felon, Jack.</i>

421
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:06,111
You've spent most of the day
breaking one law after another,

422
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:08,279
for what, for them?

423
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:14,291
- What do you want me to do?
- Not make a scene.

424
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:18,229
<i>You walked them into Ray's, you can
walk them out. I'll take it from there.</i>

425
00:41:18,264 --> 00:41:21,028
<i>And to show my appreciation
for your trouble,</i>

426
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:22,864
I'll wipe your slate clean.

427
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:26,805
Just walk away, huh?
No harm, no foul?

428
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,704
That's right. Just walk away.

429
00:41:28,741 --> 00:41:32,006
You've got five minutes, Jack,
and then it's all over.

430
00:41:32,778 --> 00:41:34,507
Five minutes. I'll see you then.

431
00:41:41,087 --> 00:41:45,114
I don't trust him. Cover all the exits.

432
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:52,429
They're here for us, aren't they?

433
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:56,034
Yeah. They are.

434
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,138
- I knew we couldn't trust him.
- Excuse me?

435
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:01,730
- Too late. We have to run!
- Wait.

436
00:42:01,774 --> 00:42:04,834
I was wondering what your town's
policy is regarding firearms.

437
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:05,901
Excuse me?

438
00:42:05,945 --> 00:42:08,209
There's a lot of guns
coming in right now.

439
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,619
Come on. Come on.

440
00:42:18,157 --> 00:42:20,125
I think he's over here.

441
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:38,309
Can I help you boys out?

442
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:41,336
Official government business.
Excuse me.

443
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,941
Officially my town.
That makes it my business.

444
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:53,384
Mr. Carson.

445
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,566
- You're making a big mistake, sheriff.
- I'll take my chances.

446
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:12,839
Dude, I told you I should have a gun.

447
00:43:12,878 --> 00:43:15,847
Now might not be the best time
to bring that up... dude.

448
00:43:18,517 --> 00:43:19,984
This is not good.

449
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:27,258
Shh. Follow me.

450
00:43:34,734 --> 00:43:36,361
Up there.

451
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:39,804
OK.

452
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,407
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

453
00:43:48,881 --> 00:43:52,578
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

454
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:08,632
It's locked from the outside.
We got to find another...

455
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,396
Hey, hey, hey!

456
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:18,542
Or we could do that, whatever that is.

457
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:21,637
My brother has the ability
to control his molecular density

458
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,148
which allows him
to phase through solid objects

459
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:26,174
or withstand the greatest of impacts.

460
00:44:28,087 --> 00:44:30,647
That's neat. Real neat.

461
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:37,928
You've got some mighty big friends in
some mighty big places. You check out.

462
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:03,888
Hi, little fella.

463
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:17,135
We appreciate your understanding.

464
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:20,104
Let's go.

465
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:26,373
We got an open hatch
leading to the roof.

466
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:28,039
We're on our way.

467
00:45:31,283 --> 00:45:33,046
Eddie! Time's up. We got to go.

468
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:35,451
Go? I still got
a lot of work to do on her.

469
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,786
Next time we're in town,
we'll make an appointment.

470
00:45:42,294 --> 00:45:43,921
- You want my card, or...
- No.

471
00:45:57,176 --> 00:46:00,668
Taxi's on the move. I want every
possible escape route locked down.

472
00:46:00,713 --> 00:46:02,738
I want that cab and everyone in it!

473
00:46:03,082 --> 00:46:04,549
Too many of them to outrun.

474
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:12,050
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.

475
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:22,866
Ah!

476
00:46:30,242 --> 00:46:31,834
Say goodbye to Stony Creek!

477
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,510
What? No, no, not now! Come on!

478
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:42,180
Sara. Sara, are you doing this?

479
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:47,124
Sara, I said... Oh! Absolutely not!

480
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:50,026
This junkyard is not going with us.

481
00:46:50,062 --> 00:46:52,360
I am done picking up stray passengers.

482
00:47:06,512 --> 00:47:08,980
Those guys who were
chasing us were the same ones

483
00:47:09,014 --> 00:47:10,709
- from the highway, right?
- Yes.

484
00:47:10,749 --> 00:47:12,944
It is vital you take us
to their base of operation.

485
00:47:12,985 --> 00:47:15,886
You want me to take you to
the guys who are trying to kill you?

486
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:18,116
Let me explain to you
how we do things here on Earth.

487
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:20,648
People who want you dead, you avoid.

488
00:47:20,693 --> 00:47:24,390
That way you... mm-mmm... stay alive.
Make sense?

489
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:28,662
No one on your planet will stay alive
if we do not return to our planet.

490
00:47:28,701 --> 00:47:30,999
In order to return, we need our ship.

491
00:47:31,036 --> 00:47:34,870
Those men who were trying to kill us
have stolen our ship. Make sense?

492
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:41,642
Where do you suggest
we begin our search?

493
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,648
I don't suggest
we begin searching at all.

494
00:47:43,682 --> 00:47:46,810
I do suggest we go back to Vegas
and I drop you off where you got on.

495
00:47:46,852 --> 00:47:50,117
You, too.

496
00:47:50,155 --> 00:47:53,318
It's just as I thought.
No human is gonna help us.

497
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,826
Especially not this human.

498
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,590
Hey. Easy on the human-bashing, OK?

499
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,996
Some of my best friends
just happen to be human.

500
00:48:00,032 --> 00:48:02,432
Even if I helped,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

501
00:48:02,468 --> 00:48:05,801
I don't know anything
about UFOs or aliens or...

502
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:07,362
Who's Dr. Alex Friedman?

503
00:48:09,942 --> 00:48:12,103
She's actually somebody who can help.

504
00:48:12,144 --> 00:48:15,443
And, for the record,
she happens to be human.

505
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:23,478
No sign of the taxi from anyone yet.

506
00:48:23,522 --> 00:48:27,253
Extend the search. They're out there.

507
00:48:34,566 --> 00:48:38,400
Sara.

508
00:48:38,437 --> 00:48:41,998
He would appreciate you pulling over
so that he can relieve himself.

509
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:45,841
We don't have time for that. He should
have went before we left Stony Creek.

510
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:47,869
He isn't pleased with your attitude.

511
00:48:47,913 --> 00:48:49,642
Really? Is that the way he feels?

512
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:53,982
You remind him
that I'm a man and he's a dog.

513
00:48:54,019 --> 00:48:58,183
And I'm not about to have this
or any conversation with a dog.

514
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:00,919
So my answer is still no.

515
00:49:10,235 --> 00:49:11,634
Junkyard says thank you.

516
00:49:13,439 --> 00:49:15,737
Did he, now?
Is there anything else he wants?

517
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:20,677
Oh. He said he would love
a bone or a meaty treat.

518
00:49:20,713 --> 00:49:23,580
Top of my to-do list. Just get in.

519
00:50:10,229 --> 00:50:11,787
Taxi!

520
00:50:19,471 --> 00:50:20,836
Hey.

521
00:50:20,873 --> 00:50:24,070
I need you to keep the cab close
and give the dog some water.

522
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:27,670
And, uh, give him a meaty treat.

523
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:36,716
OK. So stay close to me,
don't talk to anyone, nice and normal.

524
00:50:38,323 --> 00:50:43,158
I'm telling yOu.
He walked right paSt me. Bad mOve.

525
00:50:43,195 --> 00:50:46,323
This was captured
by a far-imaging telescope

526
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:50,461
at the University of Bonn
less than 48 hours ago.

527
00:50:50,502 --> 00:50:52,936
What I want
to direct your attention to is this.

528
00:50:54,873 --> 00:50:59,173
- That looks like a smudge.
- Yes. Yes, it does.

529
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:01,441
Was it a spaceship?
Did they abduct you?

530
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,504
Excuse me?

531
00:51:02,548 --> 00:51:05,346
- Were the aliens the Greys?
- Or the lizard people?

532
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:08,148
What? No, I wasn't abducted by anyone.

533
00:51:08,187 --> 00:51:10,485
How do you know?
Dr. Harlan's last book

534
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:13,719
was all about how the aliens
can erase your memory with probes.

535
00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:16,057
- Donald Harlan's book?
- You may have been probed.

536
00:51:16,094 --> 00:51:19,188
It's pure science fiction.

537
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:24,498
I am talking about science fact here,
hard data, not crop circles.

538
00:51:24,536 --> 00:51:27,198
Have you ever actually
been inside a crop circle?

539
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,073
I have. It was huge.
It's where the mother ship landed,

540
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:34,909
where they took me on board,
where I was married to an alien woman.

541
00:51:34,947 --> 00:51:37,711
That is it.
I will not answer any more questions

542
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:41,685
about alien abductions,
crop circles or Dr. Harlan.

543
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,087
Is that clear? If we could just
get back to the matter at hand.

544
00:51:45,123 --> 00:51:47,148
People, hello, excuse me.

545
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:49,683
I promise it will be worth it.
The blue nebula...

546
00:51:49,728 --> 00:51:54,324
We got a hit on Bruno's license plate.
They're back in Vegas.

547
00:51:54,366 --> 00:51:58,200
<i>Attention.
The foundation has been rescheduled...</i>

548
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,440
The cattle mutilation lecture doesn't
start for an hour. But grab a seat.

549
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:07,604
This place will be packed. It always is.

550
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:10,513
- We're here to see you, actually.
- Oh.

551
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:13,040
It's Jack Bruno. We met earlier.

552
00:52:13,085 --> 00:52:14,882
We did?

553
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,617
Cab... airport to hotel... driver.

554
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:22,855
Oh. The nonbeliever. What are the odds?

555
00:52:22,895 --> 00:52:24,829
Is there someplace we can talk?

556
00:52:25,998 --> 00:52:28,865
The, uh... crowds in here
making you uncomfortable?

557
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:30,698
Even more private than this.

558
00:52:30,736 --> 00:52:32,601
Look, no offense, but I'm pretty busy...

559
00:52:32,638 --> 00:52:36,267
She's doubting her thesis on
Gliese 581 and Alcubierre's warp drive.

560
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:42,836
- How did you know that?
- Oh, it gets a lot better. Trust me.

561
00:52:45,317 --> 00:52:48,184
- Are you insane?
- I just thought you, of all people,

562
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,983
would understand and want to help.

563
00:52:50,022 --> 00:52:52,991
Why, because I'm the nutjob
speaking at the UFO convention?

564
00:52:53,025 --> 00:52:56,654
- Don't answer that.
- I know it sounds really crazy.

565
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:59,630
Ya think? Hey.
Please don't touch that.

566
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:01,633
You captured an image of our ship.

567
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:05,831
The smudge? You're telling me
you think the smudge is your spaceship?

568
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:09,238
No, we don't think it's our spaceship.
We know it is our spaceship.

569
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:12,405
That's it. I'm out.

570
00:53:12,444 --> 00:53:14,674
If you'll excuse me,
I'll grab my laptop...

571
00:53:30,228 --> 00:53:33,527
Oh. They can also
do all this stuff, too.

572
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:38,793
Who are you?

573
00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:41,463
Show her.

574
00:54:22,414 --> 00:54:25,577
This is... huge.

575
00:54:25,617 --> 00:54:28,245
I have so many questions,
though you are the answers,

576
00:54:28,286 --> 00:54:30,254
here, standing right in front of me.

577
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:36,391
I'm sorry. I'm very excited. Right.

578
00:54:37,763 --> 00:54:39,731
W... Where are you from?

579
00:54:39,765 --> 00:54:43,462
Our planet is located
some 3,000 light-years from Earth.

580
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,897
Space travel of such sizable distance...

581
00:54:46,938 --> 00:54:48,929
Using a paradoxical
passage in the unbounded...

582
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:50,441
Wormholes. That's it.

583
00:54:50,475 --> 00:54:53,933
My presentation at SETI
National Convention was right.

584
00:54:53,979 --> 00:54:58,712
Interstellar travel is possible using
wormholes as a shortcut through space.

585
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,150
That was my first guess as well,
the wormholes.

586
00:55:02,888 --> 00:55:04,116
Continue, doctor.

587
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:09,260
- Why did you come to Earth?
- Our planet is dying.

588
00:55:09,294 --> 00:55:11,091
Millennia of neglect has rendered

589
00:55:11,129 --> 00:55:13,359
- our atmosphere unbreathable.
- Familiar.

590
00:55:13,398 --> 00:55:15,662
Our parents are scientists
who have studied Earth's

591
00:55:15,701 --> 00:55:18,192
climates in hopes of finding
a solution for our planet.

592
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:19,999
Our people's fears began to rise.

593
00:55:20,038 --> 00:55:23,303
Our parents discovered something
our leaders were interested in.

594
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:27,277
Your planet makes a suitable
living environment for our kind.

595
00:55:27,312 --> 00:55:32,306
It would be simplest to abandon
our dying planet and... occupy yours.

596
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,614
Wait. I'm helping you
conquer my own planet?

597
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:38,214
No. Most of the people on our planet
are fiercely opposed to this plan.

598
00:55:38,256 --> 00:55:40,315
Fear of extinction
triumphed among our people.

599
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:42,519
But then our parents
discovered a solution.

600
00:55:42,561 --> 00:55:45,928
An experiment at an outpost here
was successful in regenerating life

601
00:55:45,964 --> 00:55:48,023
into all previous
dying plants and trees.

602
00:55:48,066 --> 00:55:51,433
Which would enable the re-oxygenating
of your poisoned atmosphere.

603
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,166
- So what's the problem?
- Our military.

604
00:55:54,206 --> 00:55:56,470
They preferred invasion over science.

605
00:55:56,508 --> 00:55:59,306
Which is why we had to hurry
and retrieve the experiment.

606
00:56:00,178 --> 00:56:04,842
All proof that our planet can be saved,
and your planet spared, is in here.

607
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:07,784
- Where are your parents?
- They were arrested.

608
00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:09,684
We agreed to complete the task for them.

609
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:13,987
- What about the assassin?
- Assassin? What assassin?

610
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:17,461
The Siphon warrior series Deraniun 75
was created by our military.

611
00:56:17,496 --> 00:56:20,124
- They're bred to hunt?
- Bred to kill.

612
00:56:20,165 --> 00:56:23,601
If we don't return back home in time,
the invasion will proceed.

613
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:27,035
We seriously need
to find your spaceship.

614
00:56:34,379 --> 00:56:36,279
How well do you know this guy?

615
00:56:36,314 --> 00:56:39,647
We've done a few panels
and debates together on opposite sides.

616
00:56:39,684 --> 00:56:42,118
But no one knows the shadow world of

617
00:56:42,154 --> 00:56:44,952
UFO government conspiracies
better than Harlan.

618
00:56:47,092 --> 00:56:48,423
Not now, Whitley.

619
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:51,928
Well, hello, Dr. Friedman.

620
00:56:51,963 --> 00:56:54,329
So you've finally decided
to accept my offer

621
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:56,527
of a romantic Benihana dinner for two.

622
00:56:56,568 --> 00:56:59,662
- Huzzah!
- What?

623
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:03,697
Ahem. Uh... Three years ago,
a screening of the Cooper footage.

624
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:06,905
You were in the fourth row,
second seat, in a saucy flower print.

625
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:10,540
Sorry, I keep my work and
social life separate. I don't date...

626
00:57:10,582 --> 00:57:14,245
...colleagues.
- Colleagues. Indeed.

627
00:57:14,286 --> 00:57:17,016
Listen, we need to see
Harlan right away.

628
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:20,149
Dr. Harlan is presently
unavailable for consultations.

629
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:22,683
We're more than qualified
to answer questions.

630
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:24,058
There is no time for that.

631
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:27,656
It is a matter of life and death
that we see Harlan now.

632
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:29,394
Life and death, ooh!

633
00:57:29,434 --> 00:57:33,768
Uber scary drama queen theatrics.
What's the 411 sitch?

634
00:57:33,805 --> 00:57:38,208
You're currently alive. Unless you
take us to Harlan, you'll be dead.

635
00:57:39,644 --> 00:57:42,306
We should...
Together if you want to. Right now.

636
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:47,478
Go away!

637
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,546
The book signing
is not till 4:30. Read the brochure.

638
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,649
Harlan, it's Alex Friedman.

639
00:57:58,029 --> 00:58:02,523
<i>Dr. Alex Friedman. Quelle surprise.</i>

640
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:05,434
We have to speak with you
immediately. It is important.

641
00:58:09,274 --> 00:58:13,938
So you're saying the three of you
witnessed this reported UFO crash.

642
00:58:13,979 --> 00:58:15,640
- That's right.
- We were wondering if

643
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,705
there was any intel
amongst your sources.

644
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:21,412
I hate lying. I really don't like lying.

645
00:58:21,453 --> 00:58:24,718
I can tell when people are lying to me.

646
00:58:24,756 --> 00:58:28,453
But, thankfully, your story checks out

647
00:58:28,493 --> 00:58:32,520
with all the reports I got from
SETI and NORAD and NASA.

648
00:58:32,564 --> 00:58:33,588
We have reason to believe

649
00:58:33,632 --> 00:58:37,295
government-sponsored operatives
recovered the spacecraft.

650
00:58:37,335 --> 00:58:40,600
OK. Back up a little.
This is not space camp.

651
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:42,903
Let the experts do their work.

652
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:47,002
You're very lucky, you two,
that you didn't come face to face

653
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,741
with the aliens who were in that craft.

654
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:54,650
They're like deadly praying mantises.
They eat your flesh.

655
00:58:54,686 --> 00:58:57,746
Oh. Yes, we are, indeed, lucky kids

656
00:58:57,789 --> 00:59:01,281
not to have had our
flesh eaten by the aliens.

657
00:59:01,326 --> 00:59:04,853
You got that right.
OK. Let's go to work here.

658
00:59:04,896 --> 00:59:08,992
I got an e-mail from a source
that sent me this sat-grab.

659
00:59:09,034 --> 00:59:11,559
Where would they take
the spaceship? 51? Nellis?

660
00:59:11,603 --> 00:59:15,937
- Wright-Patterson? Vandenberg?
- From the size and scope of the crash,

661
00:59:15,974 --> 00:59:18,704
I would say there's
only one possibility.

662
00:59:18,743 --> 00:59:20,370
- Witch Mountain?
- Witch Mountain.

663
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:22,607
What, are we a singing group here?

664
00:59:22,647 --> 00:59:25,946
- Let me talk, and you guys nod a bit.
- I apologize. I'm sorry.

665
00:59:25,984 --> 00:59:27,508
Witch Mountain.

666
00:59:27,552 --> 00:59:31,010
Let's take a look.
Here we go. California.

667
00:59:31,056 --> 00:59:33,889
About 50 miles
from the border of Nevada.

668
00:59:33,925 --> 00:59:37,725
And it's one of our
top-secret facilities.

669
00:59:37,762 --> 00:59:40,356
I got a schematic here someplace.

670
00:59:40,398 --> 00:59:43,299
If you're planning on visiting, don't.

671
00:59:43,335 --> 00:59:46,998
When I say this place
is fortified up to the yin yang,

672
00:59:47,038 --> 00:59:49,165
I'm making an understatement.

673
00:59:49,207 --> 00:59:52,802
Here's the schematic.
And do you have the book?

674
00:59:52,844 --> 00:59:53,868
Yes, I do.

675
00:59:53,912 --> 00:59:57,348
All right, then, here's an aerial view.

676
00:59:57,382 --> 01:00:00,749
Thank you, Harlan, for everything.

677
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:03,780
Whatever trouble you're in...

678
01:00:04,756 --> 01:00:07,486
...trust no one.

679
01:00:18,103 --> 01:00:20,503
Thank you, both of you.

680
01:00:20,538 --> 01:00:23,564
Seth and I understand
you don't have to go forward with us,

681
01:00:23,608 --> 01:00:26,702
- and yet you choose to.
- You're welcome.

682
01:00:26,745 --> 01:00:31,705
And don't worry.
We're gonna get you home. I promise.

683
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,481
I'm gonna grab my stuff. Let's meet
upstairs in the convention, at my booth.

684
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,751
- Then we get your cab.
- Alex, uh, listen.

685
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:41,088
- I can't let you come with us.
- What?

686
01:00:41,126 --> 01:00:43,720
If half of what Harlan says
is true, it's too dangerous.

687
01:00:43,762 --> 01:00:45,753
They got in my cab.
They're my problem.

688
01:00:45,797 --> 01:00:49,824
Um, no. I have spent my entire life
preparing for this moment.

689
01:00:49,868 --> 01:00:52,359
Now, when I have two actual aliens
in need of my help,

690
01:00:52,404 --> 01:00:53,598
you want me to walk away?

691
01:00:53,638 --> 01:00:56,573
It's not gonna happen.
Man up, soldier. I'm in.

692
01:00:57,776 --> 01:00:59,641
Just lay low till we meet up.

693
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:02,942
Sure. Great. Lay low.
Easy. How hard could that be?

694
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:07,511
She thinks you're very handsome.

695
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,286
- Really?
- And smarter than you think you are.

696
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:14,258
So she was thinking about me?

697
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:16,817
At least as much
as you were thinking about her.

698
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,958
So she didn't happen to mention
in her thoughts that I was...

699
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,524
It's showtime, everybody!

700
01:01:23,568 --> 01:01:26,765
Space Expo Number Nine.
It's upstairs. Come on.

701
01:01:26,805 --> 01:01:30,172
- Should we go upstairs now?
- Yeah. Let's go upstairs.

702
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,381
Do you think she was thinking about...?

703
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:42,147
Seth. Sara! Seth!

704
01:01:42,187 --> 01:01:45,384
- Jack.
- I tried to warn you, Jack.

705
01:01:45,423 --> 01:01:47,550
Mr. Wolfe doesn't take rejection well.

706
01:01:51,129 --> 01:01:53,188
This is so not a good time.

707
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:55,961
- Ah! Oh!
- You're out of time, Jack.

708
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,960
Well, well, well. If it isn't
the Rebel Alliance cab driver scum.

709
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:04,202
Not such a tough guy out
of your ship, are you, womp rat?

710
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:05,539
You're in our house now!

711
01:02:05,577 --> 01:02:08,740
Ah!

712
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:14,281
Move! Move!

713
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:20,450
Hi! I'm Sunday.
Welcome to Planet Hollywood.

714
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:23,052
Are you gentlemen here
for the UFO Space Expo?

715
01:02:23,094 --> 01:02:24,618
Wouldn't miss it.

716
01:02:28,066 --> 01:02:30,591
Seth! Sara!

717
01:02:36,674 --> 01:02:39,802
- Wow!
- Costume's great, man.

718
01:02:41,146 --> 01:02:42,170
Whoa!

719
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:46,410
Seth! Seth!

720
01:02:47,085 --> 01:02:48,484
Sara!

721
01:02:53,525 --> 01:02:55,083
Seth. Sara.

722
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:57,185
I'm sorry.

723
01:03:06,971 --> 01:03:10,964
I sure hope we have enough fuelage
to get back to planet Earth, Conrad.

724
01:03:11,009 --> 01:03:13,773
Fear not, Celeste.
We must get to the ship.

725
01:03:13,811 --> 01:03:18,441
Ah!

726
01:03:18,483 --> 01:03:19,950
My leg!

727
01:03:19,984 --> 01:03:23,181
No!
Look at that beast from another galaxy.

728
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:24,916
It's so disgusting and scaly!

729
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:26,753
Didn't I tell you two
to stay by my side?

730
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:28,053
I heard you the first time.

731
01:03:28,092 --> 01:03:30,720
Is this reenactment an important
piece of Earth's history?

732
01:03:30,762 --> 01:03:34,357
- Stand back, you beast!
- No. Come on. Let's go. We got to go.

733
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:37,995
Jack Bruno.

734
01:03:47,946 --> 01:03:49,311
Sara!

735
01:03:54,686 --> 01:03:55,846
Let's go! Let's go!

736
01:03:57,755 --> 01:03:58,779
You're down!

737
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:02,718
Everybody, down!

738
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,388
Stay down! Stay down! Stay down!

739
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,421
Get down! You, down! Everybody, down!

740
01:04:07,465 --> 01:04:09,365
You with the blue hair, right there!

741
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,733
Best... convention... ever.

742
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,328
Not here! Move out!

743
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:33,689
Other way. Other way.

744
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:03,686
Sara, are you listening
to what I'm thinking?

745
01:05:09,227 --> 01:05:11,661
Go! Go! Move it, move it!

746
01:05:11,696 --> 01:05:13,095
Keep going! Keep going!

747
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:19,026
Oh. That's me.

748
01:05:24,809 --> 01:05:26,242
Got to go!

749
01:05:26,277 --> 01:05:29,804
- What happened to laying low?
- Who lays low in Vegas?

750
01:05:31,382 --> 01:05:33,509
Move, move! Get out of the way!

751
01:05:33,551 --> 01:05:35,576
Move it! Get out of my way!

752
01:06:25,069 --> 01:06:28,732
We got them!
Our suspects. No one else interferes.

753
01:06:28,773 --> 01:06:31,765
Do not move! Do not move!

754
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:36,474
Stay inside the vehicle!
Hands where we can see them!

755
01:06:38,316 --> 01:06:41,479
Greetings, Earthlings.

756
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:11,642
I didn't even imagine they'd actually
look human, much less like kids.

757
01:07:11,682 --> 01:07:13,582
They're lucky you joined us, doctor.

758
01:07:13,618 --> 01:07:15,984
We're lucky... you joined us.

759
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:20,218
Luck has nothing to do with it.
It's pure science.

760
01:07:20,258 --> 01:07:24,388
Chaos theory, the underlying order
in apparently random data.

761
01:07:25,163 --> 01:07:26,630
So more like fate?

762
01:07:26,664 --> 01:07:30,031
Mmm... Science. Think about it.

763
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:34,436
What are the odds that they would crash
near Vegas during a UFO convention?

764
01:07:34,472 --> 01:07:36,531
I got in your cab.
Then they got in your cab.

765
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:38,974
And now we're all
in Harlan's mobile home

766
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:43,379
loaded with his intel on where
their ship is. That is not luck.

767
01:07:43,414 --> 01:07:46,781
That is a predetermined order of
how things work in the universe.

768
01:07:46,818 --> 01:07:48,581
Have you always been this positive?

769
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:51,812
I have always been
a searcher for answers,

770
01:07:51,856 --> 01:07:55,019
though my folks would say
I was merely a daydreamer.

771
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,154
How about you?

772
01:07:57,195 --> 01:08:00,392
Me? I'm a, uh,
much easier book to read.

773
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,324
All my life
my answers have been "yes" or "no. "

774
01:08:05,636 --> 01:08:06,967
Zero gray areas.

775
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:12,137
Where does the Mustang fall?
A yes or a no?

776
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:13,905
That's not just any Mustang.

777
01:08:13,945 --> 01:08:17,642
That's a 1968
Ford Mustang GT 390 Fastback.

778
01:08:18,716 --> 01:08:20,843
<i>Steve McQueen's car in Bullitt?</i>

779
01:08:20,885 --> 01:08:24,582
<i>- You've never seen Bullitt?
- Uh, no.</i>

780
01:08:24,622 --> 01:08:28,683
Er... It's currently a no.

781
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:31,524
But one day I'm gonna earn
that car, the honest way.

782
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,930
And then it will be my yes.

783
01:08:37,235 --> 01:08:40,432
- Jack?
- What's up, pal?

784
01:08:41,772 --> 01:08:43,103
Are we there yet?

785
01:08:44,842 --> 01:08:46,935
- "Are we there yet?"
- Unbelievable.

786
01:08:46,978 --> 01:08:49,105
Good in any universe, apparently.

787
01:08:49,146 --> 01:08:51,137
- Well, Alex?
- Yes.

788
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:12,329
The maps are 30 years old,
but they're the best intel we've got.

789
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,862
Looks to be about five miles
from here to the entrance.

790
01:09:15,907 --> 01:09:17,067
OK.

791
01:09:18,576 --> 01:09:19,634
Let's rock and roll.

792
01:09:41,566 --> 01:09:43,830
There's gotta be
another entrance.

793
01:09:51,509 --> 01:09:52,874
If the map's right,

794
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:55,811
there are several service
tunnels spreading outward.

795
01:09:55,846 --> 01:09:58,110
- Worth looking for, right?
- Let's go.

796
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:01,808
Ah! Jack...

797
01:10:01,852 --> 01:10:03,615
Sara.

798
01:10:03,654 --> 01:10:07,556
<i>Sara! Seth!</i>

799
01:10:09,894 --> 01:10:14,331
Mr. Bruno and, I believe, Dr. Friedman.

800
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:17,300
- What did you do to them?
- Consider yourself lucky.

801
01:10:17,335 --> 01:10:19,963
I could have had you both
shot on sight for trespassing

802
01:10:20,004 --> 01:10:22,268
and violation
of US government property.

803
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,842
Sara!

804
01:10:29,547 --> 01:10:30,809
Ah!

805
01:10:36,187 --> 01:10:39,384
There you go. All right.

806
01:10:39,423 --> 01:10:43,120
Sir. With all due respect,
you have to listen to me.

807
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,459
They came in peace.
We cannot respond with violence.

808
01:10:46,497 --> 01:10:48,488
The future of Earth depends on it.

809
01:10:48,532 --> 01:10:51,057
It is absolutely vital
that they get home.

810
01:10:51,736 --> 01:10:55,866
They are home, Dr. Friedman.
They are now in my custody.

811
01:10:55,906 --> 01:11:00,240
"Custody?" You can't expect to
keep them prisoner and get away with it.

812
01:11:00,277 --> 01:11:03,644
- They have rights.
- They're illegal aliens on US soil,

813
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:05,239
without so much as a passport.

814
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:09,685
The Patriot Act enables me to detain
them for as long as is necessary.

815
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,745
You can't keep this quiet.

816
01:11:11,789 --> 01:11:14,690
The world has the right
to know that they exist.

817
01:11:15,593 --> 01:11:18,790
And you're going to be the one
to blow the whistle, doctor?

818
01:11:18,829 --> 01:11:24,165
A failed astrophysicist fired by three
universities for obsessing over UFOs

819
01:11:24,201 --> 01:11:27,170
teams up with an ex-con
in declaring that the government

820
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:30,640
has captured two normal-looking kids
and is holding them hostage

821
01:11:30,675 --> 01:11:33,542
inside a mountain that doesn't exist?

822
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:36,973
It would be so much easier
to let you speak

823
01:11:37,014 --> 01:11:41,178
than to deal with all the paperwork
involved with killing you.

824
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:44,381
- Someone will believe us.
- From behind bars?

825
01:11:44,422 --> 01:11:47,289
Let me remind you, Mr. Bruno,
as a convicted felon,

826
01:11:47,324 --> 01:11:51,283
you're looking at 20 years just for
standing on this mountain talking to me.

827
01:11:51,328 --> 01:11:52,488
Shall I go on?

828
01:11:53,964 --> 01:11:56,159
No. I get the message.

829
01:11:57,635 --> 01:12:01,264
Smart man. Give them a lift back down.

830
01:12:01,305 --> 01:12:05,139
What? That's it? It's over?

831
01:12:05,176 --> 01:12:09,044
I'm sorry. I will not go back to prison.

832
01:12:10,314 --> 01:12:11,508
Let's go.

833
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:21,120
Thankfully Seth and Sara didn't
have to witness how quickly you gave up.

834
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:24,491
I told them from the beginning it was
a suicide mission, I wasn't wrong.

835
01:12:24,528 --> 01:12:26,325
They trusted you. I trusted you.

836
01:12:26,363 --> 01:12:29,332
Join the club of everybody else
in my life who I've disappointed.

837
01:12:29,366 --> 01:12:32,301
They will dissect them
like frogs in biology. You know that.

838
01:12:32,336 --> 01:12:34,270
It's not my problem and it never...

839
01:12:34,305 --> 01:12:36,136
Hey!

840
01:12:51,622 --> 01:12:54,455
By the way, that slap, very realistic.

841
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:57,452
When did you know?

842
01:12:57,495 --> 01:13:00,487
You haven't bailed on the kids yet.
Why start now?

843
01:13:06,937 --> 01:13:09,098
How soon until
the subjects are prepped?

844
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,732
They're heavily sedated.

845
01:13:10,775 --> 01:13:14,768
Minimal med tests
proceeding within 48 to 72 hours.

846
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:18,441
Unacceptable. Commence the procedure.

847
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:20,712
We don't know enough
about their systems.

848
01:13:20,751 --> 01:13:23,481
Any sudden change
could terminate the subjects.

849
01:13:23,521 --> 01:13:25,250
You can't just kill them.

850
01:13:26,557 --> 01:13:32,496
Mr. Pope. You would do well
not to forget what our mission is.

851
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,521
Our orders come from Washington,

852
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:38,524
and Washington wants answers
to some very complex questions.

853
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:40,901
Our goal is to provide those answers.

854
01:13:40,938 --> 01:13:45,466
Now, if you are doubting your ability...

855
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:48,910
No... sir.

856
01:13:50,714 --> 01:13:54,946
Very good, then.
Commence the tests, Mr. Matheson.

857
01:13:54,985 --> 01:13:57,749
Right away, sir. Initiating tests.

858
01:14:03,961 --> 01:14:08,057
- Here. Here.
- Coming... Almost...

859
01:14:17,074 --> 01:14:19,668
- After you.
- I'm right behind you.

860
01:14:21,278 --> 01:14:22,302
Thanks.

861
01:14:36,861 --> 01:14:39,159
- Back up. Back up for a second.
- What?

862
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,380
It's gonna be OK.
I'm gonna be here the whole time.

863
01:15:05,422 --> 01:15:08,220
I'll be right below you the whole time.

864
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:11,287
- I can.
- You can.

865
01:15:11,328 --> 01:15:15,458
- Here I go. Oh, boy.
- That's it. Right here.

866
01:15:18,502 --> 01:15:20,527
- You got it.
- Here we go.

867
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:24,337
Ah! What's that?

868
01:15:25,676 --> 01:15:28,338
Oh, no, Jack. Exhaust furnace!

869
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:32,315
This way. Come here.
There's another tunnel right here.

870
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,780
Hurry! Hurry!

871
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,439
- You OK?
- Yeah.

872
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:59,442
OK. Let's go.

873
01:16:25,436 --> 01:16:27,427
What now?

874
01:16:27,471 --> 01:16:31,373
- Find the kids. Don't get caught.
- Good plan.

875
01:16:31,408 --> 01:16:35,105
We're very close to determining
the source of their powers.

876
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:41,918
Yes, sir, containment
is at a hundred percent.

877
01:16:41,952 --> 01:16:45,718
We've recovered
the two targets and their spacecraft.

878
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:53,530
I understand. Thank you, sir.

879
01:16:53,564 --> 01:16:56,328
And thank you
for sticking by me and the project.

880
01:16:56,367 --> 01:16:58,494
I know it's taken
a long time to get here,

881
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:02,096
but we both agree
it's been worth our previous failures.

882
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:10,573
All vitals
appear to be stabilized.

883
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:15,942
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

884
01:17:15,986 --> 01:17:18,614
<i>South perimeter is now closed off.</i>

885
01:17:18,655 --> 01:17:21,419
<i>South perimeter, closed off.</i>

886
01:17:24,395 --> 01:17:28,024
<i>Stand by, all departments,
for re-check of radiation.</i>

887
01:17:33,604 --> 01:17:35,731
<i>Whiskey 7,
we have penetration</i>

888
01:17:35,839 --> 01:17:39,969
<i>in fence sector 28. Break. Tango 31.
All stations, general alert.</i>

889
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:42,672
Bruno. Deadly force authorized.

890
01:17:42,713 --> 01:17:45,443
Project Moon Dust troops,
meet me in sector two.

891
01:17:45,482 --> 01:17:47,575
<i>Red alert, security breach!</i>

892
01:17:47,618 --> 01:17:50,052
<i>Red alert, security breach! Red alert!</i>

893
01:17:50,621 --> 01:17:55,456
<i>Close containment doors, all levels!
Close containment doors, all levels!</i>

894
01:18:10,174 --> 01:18:13,405
<i>This facility's on red alert!</i>

895
01:18:16,313 --> 01:18:19,612
<i>- Bravo Team, follow me!
- Attention! Attention!</i>

896
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:22,778
Go, go, go! Move!

897
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:25,688
Incoming!

898
01:18:30,194 --> 01:18:33,595
Fall back! Fall back!
Get those men out of there!

899
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,897
Hi. Can I borrow that pen?

900
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:47,873
I have three older brothers.

901
01:18:54,218 --> 01:18:56,482
Sir, this area has been compromised.

902
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,183
- Make sure the blast door's sealed.
- Seal it off!

903
01:19:00,224 --> 01:19:02,818
We got an Alpha Level One breach
in the main complex.

904
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,020
All units, respond!

905
01:19:04,061 --> 01:19:07,030
Isolate, lock down
and secure your sectors now!

906
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,865
Keep moving! Keep moving!

907
01:19:10,901 --> 01:19:13,267
We lost all communication
with sector five!

908
01:19:34,825 --> 01:19:36,918
Come on, come on. Wake up!

909
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,450
Ah!

910
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:48,131
Ah!

911
01:19:52,242 --> 01:19:55,803
We are under attack. I repeat,
all levels have been compromised.

912
01:19:55,846 --> 01:19:59,407
- We are under attack.
- Sir? Sir!

913
01:20:00,918 --> 01:20:02,010
What was that?

914
01:20:02,052 --> 01:20:05,419
No idea. It's cutting down
our troops, driving for...

915
01:20:05,455 --> 01:20:08,947
Straight for the lab!
Let's go! Move! Move!

916
01:20:08,992 --> 01:20:10,254
Let's go! Clear out!

917
01:20:17,634 --> 01:20:21,866
- What is it?
- Uh, some sort of anesthetic.

918
01:20:21,905 --> 01:20:24,430
- Can you fix it?
- I don't know, but I can try.

919
01:20:24,474 --> 01:20:27,739
These locks are too strong.

920
01:20:27,778 --> 01:20:31,305
- Green is oxygen...
- We got to hurry. We got to hurry.

921
01:20:31,348 --> 01:20:32,372
All right...

922
01:20:34,484 --> 01:20:36,714
Can't get 'em open.

923
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:46,386
Seth.

924
01:20:47,164 --> 01:20:49,962
Seth, it's OK. It's OK.

925
01:21:02,879 --> 01:21:05,109
I'm gonna get you out of here.

926
01:21:10,654 --> 01:21:12,815
<i>...use extreme caution.</i>

927
01:21:19,596 --> 01:21:22,292
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

928
01:21:24,735 --> 01:21:26,999
<i>Security team Bravo, please report.</i>

929
01:21:39,683 --> 01:21:41,241
Let's go.

930
01:21:50,894 --> 01:21:52,589
It's over there.

931
01:22:34,004 --> 01:22:35,232
Oh, my...

932
01:22:41,411 --> 01:22:44,778
- We have to hurry.
- Well, tell them that.

933
01:22:44,815 --> 01:22:46,112
Good idea.

934
01:22:48,952 --> 01:22:50,544
Wait!

935
01:22:58,161 --> 01:23:00,186
Excuse me.

936
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:02,698
Do you not hear the alarms?

937
01:23:02,733 --> 01:23:05,600
Work in this sector
is to cease immediately.

938
01:23:05,635 --> 01:23:09,696
We have off-the-chart readings of
sodium hypochlorite, xenon, hydrazine,

939
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,903
and you don't even want to know
how bad the gamma radiation is.

940
01:23:12,943 --> 01:23:14,968
But you're gonna
have to do some serious,

941
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:16,808
and I mean serious, scrubbing down.

942
01:23:16,847 --> 01:23:21,875
- Who are you?
- Who am I? Who am I?

943
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:23,317
I'll tell you who I am.

944
01:23:23,353 --> 01:23:26,254
I am your worst nightmare
at a court-martial, soldier.

945
01:23:26,289 --> 01:23:27,984
You can either do as you're told,

946
01:23:28,024 --> 01:23:32,586
or I can go tell Henry Burke
you disobeyed his direct orders.

947
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:35,621
YOur call. ChOOSe wiSely.

948
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:43,601
I'm pleased to inform you personnel
have evacuated the ship's hangar.

949
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,801
What are you talking about?
On whose authority?

950
01:23:45,842 --> 01:23:50,040
- Yours... sir?
- Get out of the way!

951
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,342
Let's go! Move!

952
01:24:35,926 --> 01:24:38,690
Thank you.

953
01:24:38,728 --> 01:24:41,697
We were having a hard time
figuring that part out.

954
01:24:49,306 --> 01:24:53,902
- Jack...
- A brave but empty gesture, Mr. Bruno.

955
01:24:53,944 --> 01:24:55,775
They're just kids.

956
01:25:30,247 --> 01:25:33,444
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

957
01:25:33,483 --> 01:25:35,815
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

958
01:25:42,893 --> 01:25:46,795
- Go, go! Run! Run!
- Get inside!

959
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:50,789
- Get after them!
- Alpha! Bravo, on me!

960
01:25:50,834 --> 01:25:52,859
Go, go!

961
01:25:57,741 --> 01:25:59,265
Cool.

962
01:26:05,482 --> 01:26:07,575
Get this thing up in the air. Let's go!

963
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:15,257
Go, go!

964
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:31,369
Dude! I could really
use a gun right now!

965
01:26:31,408 --> 01:26:33,968
Thank you. This is a really big gun.

966
01:26:40,116 --> 01:26:43,176
Come on.

967
01:26:48,959 --> 01:26:50,551
Activate the shields.

968
01:26:50,594 --> 01:26:53,222
Power's at 25 percent
and increasing.

969
01:26:54,564 --> 01:26:56,896
No, no. No, no.

970
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:06,865
You do know how to fly this thing?

971
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:09,811
- How do you think we got here?
- You crashed. Remember?

972
01:27:15,318 --> 01:27:16,842
Siphon!

973
01:27:20,256 --> 01:27:21,314
Hold on!

974
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:24,456
Got him!

975
01:27:29,065 --> 01:27:30,225
Watch out!

976
01:27:31,735 --> 01:27:33,965
Follow the tunnels. There you go!

977
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:36,029
Lock down the mountain.

978
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:46,043
Watch out!

979
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:49,311
Just shut it down!

980
01:27:49,352 --> 01:27:51,843
<i>Gates closing in ten,</i>

981
01:27:51,888 --> 01:27:54,083
<i>nine, eight...</i>

982
01:27:54,124 --> 01:27:56,183
<i>- Watch out!
... six...</i>

983
01:27:56,226 --> 01:27:58,694
<i>- The door!
... four...</i>

984
01:27:58,728 --> 01:28:00,093
The door! The door!

985
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:02,496
<i>...two, one.
- The door!</i>

986
01:28:06,636 --> 01:28:07,796
Whoo!

987
01:28:18,281 --> 01:28:22,411
- You did it!
- We did it. We did it!

988
01:28:22,452 --> 01:28:25,353
Whoa! What was that?

989
01:28:25,388 --> 01:28:28,653
The airlock's jammed.
I need to manually override the system.

990
01:28:28,692 --> 01:28:31,217
You two fly. Just tell me what to do.

991
01:28:44,507 --> 01:28:45,531
Ah!

992
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:04,654
Alex, it takes two to pilot the ship.
I need you to take the controls.

993
01:29:04,694 --> 01:29:06,992
What? Are you insane?

994
01:29:32,255 --> 01:29:33,779
Jack!

995
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:38,652
You're better with the mask on.

996
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:10,887
Ah!

997
01:30:26,976 --> 01:30:28,500
Jack!

998
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:46,492
Yes, he's here.

999
01:30:46,529 --> 01:30:49,555
Sir, it's Washington.
They have some questions for you.

1000
01:30:57,006 --> 01:30:58,030
Sir?

1001
01:31:00,009 --> 01:31:01,704
You both must hurry.

1002
01:31:01,744 --> 01:31:03,712
Only a matter of time
before they get here.

1003
01:31:03,746 --> 01:31:06,442
- Don't worry about us.
- Sara and I want you to have this.

1004
01:31:06,482 --> 01:31:10,919
As long as it's in your possession,
we'll always be able to find you.

1005
01:31:17,327 --> 01:31:18,453
Thanks.

1006
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,961
Your parents will be very proud
of what you've done here.

1007
01:31:33,009 --> 01:31:34,874
Thank you, Alex.

1008
01:31:38,448 --> 01:31:42,885
I once said that we could never count
on humans to help us. Especially you.

1009
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:46,446
I was wrong, and for that I am sorry.

1010
01:31:46,489 --> 01:31:48,150
You take care of yourself.

1011
01:31:49,792 --> 01:31:52,625
And your sister, too. Do you understand?

1012
01:31:55,131 --> 01:31:57,361
- Yes.
- Jack?

1013
01:32:04,474 --> 01:32:07,272
You guys remember that, me and Alex...

1014
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:12,942
...we're only a wormhole away. OK?

1015
01:32:12,982 --> 01:32:15,746
I want you to promise me something.

1016
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,284
Take care of Junkyard for me.

1017
01:32:19,322 --> 01:32:22,723
Anything you want.

1018
01:32:29,866 --> 01:32:31,800
It's time.

1019
01:32:34,203 --> 01:32:36,728
<i>You're a good man, Jack.</i>

1020
01:33:51,981 --> 01:33:54,973
If everything that
you wrote about in your book is true,

1021
01:33:55,018 --> 01:33:57,077
why risk coming out
in the public at all?

1022
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,554
Why haven't you been
arrested yet, or worse?

1023
01:33:59,589 --> 01:34:03,047
We decided right away that
the more public we went with the story,

1024
01:34:03,092 --> 01:34:06,687
then the less likely we were
to... disappear.

1025
01:34:06,729 --> 01:34:10,062
And so far, clearly, we've been right.

1026
01:34:10,099 --> 01:34:13,330
- Thank you all so much for listening.
- Thank you.

1027
01:34:17,273 --> 01:34:20,265
Technically,
I planned the whole mission.

1028
01:34:30,153 --> 01:34:34,112
A big nebula guy. How's it going?

1029
01:34:34,157 --> 01:34:35,818
- Hi, boys.
- Doctor.

1030
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:41,624
Jack! Jack!

1031
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:44,462
Howdy, boys. How you doing?

1032
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,024
He touched me!

1033
01:34:47,403 --> 01:34:50,566
Come back to us, please!

1034
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,672
Good boy.

1035
01:35:04,554 --> 01:35:07,250
<i>Thank you.</i>

1036
01:35:25,341 --> 01:35:27,468
Here we go.
