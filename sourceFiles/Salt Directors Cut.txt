1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
23.975

2
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,288
North Korea
two years ago

3
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,471
Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

4
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,099
I'm really not who you think I am.

5
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,060
Please. Please. I'm not a spy.

6
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,770
You are a spy.
I'm not a spy.

7
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,065
Please let me go home.
Try again.

8
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,942
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

9
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,070
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

10
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,656
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

11
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,910
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

12
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,997
I am not a spy! I am not a spy!

13
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,104
Try again.
I am not a spy.

14
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,689
You are a spy.
I am not a spy.

15
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,191
Don't lie to me!

16
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:58,327
I am not a spy.

17
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,042
It is through the grace and munificence
of our glorious Dear Leader

18
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,837
that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea

19
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,591
has pardoned
the American imperialist

20
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,845
for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.

21
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,557
Keep your head down.
Don't say anything
till we make the swap.

22
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,353
In case Kim Jong
here changes his mind.

23
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,327
Exchange.

24
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,579
Right face!

25
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,918
Right face!

26
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,546
I don't understand.

27
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,965
You don't
understand what?

28
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,636
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life

29
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,556
is not worth blowing
operational cover.

30
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,932
You got that right.

31
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,103
If we have to
lose someone for
the greater good, we will.

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,312
So why did you do it?

33
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,316
Well, I didn't do it.

34
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,069
He did.

35
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,282
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

36
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,036
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

37
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,248
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something

38
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,960
or he's gonna invade this
goddamn rice-paddy republic
himself.

39
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,520
You okay?

40
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,107
Yeah.

41
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,903
Hey.

42
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,865
Good morning.
Happy anniversary.

43
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,078
You want me to make you breakfast?

44
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,664
How about pancakes?

45
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,791
Your cooking?

46
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,960
You're joking. You like my cooking.

47
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,128
Germans don't joke.

48
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,257
Burt likes my cooking.

49
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,349
Get your bugs off the table.

50
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,601
They're spiders.
They're bugs.

51
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,646
They're spiders.
They're bugs.

52
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,613
Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.

53
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,367
Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back,

54
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,370
and over one another
about a third of the way.

55
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,876
Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.

56
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,170
Are you doi ng this
on company time?

57
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,007
And insert your favorite silverware...
It's my anniversary.

58
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,510
And I want it to be perfect.

59
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,889
But that is not sexy.

60
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,766
No, but it is utilitarin.

61
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,102
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

62
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,856
I ran the trace. First name Usam,
last name Utsaev.

63
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,524
Any verifiable hits?
One.

64
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,028
Hey, Francis, do me
a favor and stick that
in the safe till tomorrow.

65
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,280
Mata Hari here's
got a big night tonight.

66
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,657
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

67
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,785
"Sir"? Do I look like a "sir" to you?

68
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:09,995
From head to toe.

69
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,290
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

70
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:17,628
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

71
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,506
Was I ever that young?

72
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,967
Younger.

73
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,470
Walk me out.

74
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,473
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

75
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,475
Oh, you know.
The usual.

76
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,061
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia

77
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,190
the day before it happens.
How about you?
I heard that interview went well.

78
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,067
Fingers crossed.

79
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,486
You sure about this?

80
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,614
You know, once you start pushing
paper, there's no turning back.

81
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,159
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

82
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,787
I was homesick.
Homesick?

83
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,289
Can't you take something for that?
Sir! Sir!

84
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,044
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

85
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,547
Here?
I guess he's not buying our cover.

86
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,715
Did you get his bona fides?
He's Russian.

87
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,009
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

88
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,387
He's a strange guy.
How's his English?

89
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,681
Passable. Not great.

90
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,725
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance...

91
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,521
Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

92
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,730
Come on, Salt.

93
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,067
No one can sort out a nutjob
from the real thing faster than you.

94
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,279
I got 25 minutes.
I got 26. Let's go.

95
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,288
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

96
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,707
Who called Counterintelligence?
Not me.

97
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,501
Hey, Ted.
We're crashing the party.

98
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,505
Peabody.
Salt.

99
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,470
Please remove the hood.

100
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,182
Microphones are on.

101
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,309
Checking levels.

102
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,020
Bseline recorded.

103
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,235
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

104
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,489
Ev.
Mm. Yeah.

105
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,825
Commencing audio
and visual recording.

106
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,960
Testing earpiece.

107
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,508
Interview has commenced at 1442.

108
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,311
You're married.

109
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,857
A husband must be a distraction

110
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,653
for a female intelligence officer.

111
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,988
Well, we're here to talk about you.

112
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,323
So, what is your name?

113
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,868
My name is

114
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,414
Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

115
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,837
I have cancer.

116
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,047
I'm moved.

117
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,341
A defector with cancer.

118
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,554
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

119
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,392
If I have gained anything
by damning myself,

120
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,648
it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

121
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,277
Russia is also dying.

122
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,864
But unlike me, she's not dead.
Oleg Vassily Orlov,

123
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,742
shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

124
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,203
He was on Victor Barisovsky's
staff there.

125
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,663
He checks out as FSB, Ev.

126
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,708
Scan says he's truthful
on the cancer.

127
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,293
Prior to '93?

128
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,587
Russia was once strong, poWerful...

129
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,256
Nothing.
He doesn't eXist.

130
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,177
And she Will be again
when things have been set back

131
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,345
on the correct path.

132
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,307
I have somewhere I need to be,
Mr. Orlov,

133
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,059
so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

134
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,441
I came here to tell you a story.

135
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,152
I don't like stories.

136
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,113
But I'll listen anyway.

137
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,199
In English, please.

138
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,159
Others are listening.

139
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,079
1975.

140
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,790
The Cold War.

141
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,377
In a gymnasium in Grozny,

142
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,796
a Soviet Olympic wrestler

143
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,509
named Sasha Fyorodovich
Chenkov

144
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,594
meets for the first time

145
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:40,098
the only female chess grand master
of her era;

146
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,978
Anka Nurekyova.

147
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,357
Within a month, they Were married.

148
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,985
And within a year, a child.

149
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,571
One month more,

150
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,784
the child was back
in the same hospital,

151
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,327
sick with fever.

152
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,249
And within days after that,

153
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,002
the child suddenly was dead.

154
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,050
Yes, a child Was dead.

155
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,429
And, yes, a child was buried.

156
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:30,190
But the Chenkov baby Was alive

157
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,736
and became the property
of another man.

158
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,283
A master spy Who had
devised the greatest plan

159
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,787
a Russian patriot
could ever invent.

160
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:48,292
A plan to destroy America.

161
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,919
It had all started

162
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:55,048
with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

163
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,344
In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.

164
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,431
Three years later, he returned home.

165
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,392
But the man
who came back to America

166
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:11,023
was in fact a Russian spy
named Alek.

167
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,943
On November 22nd, 1963,

168
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,656
Alek became the first success
of the neW program

169
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,327
and a hero of the Soviet Union.

170
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,622
The spymaster Was now
given the go-ahead

171
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,625
to create many more like Alek.

172
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,253
Scores of agents,
males and females,

173
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,048
to be substituted for Americans.

174
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,885
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

175
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,179
At an abandoned monastery,

176
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,141
Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English

177
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,852
long before they learned Russian.

178
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,146
Drilled in idiom,

179
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,524
idiosyncrasy and

180
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,859
ideology.

181
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:02,241
And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming,

182
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,494
the spymaster
made warriors of iron.

183
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:09,039
Unquestioning and unbreakable.

184
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,416
Who crossed first?

185
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,377
Who crossed last?

186
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,511
You're killing me, man.

187
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,888
When does the good fairy come in?

188
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,015
Never.

189
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,892
It's a story without hope.

190
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:34,064
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

191
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,818
There was an accident.
The family died.

192
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,904
Chenkov was sent to America

193
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,491
to live a complete lie

194
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,537
and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

195
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,747
Day X.

196
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:55,419
The long-awaited mission is here.

197
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,089
Chenkov will travel
to New York City

198
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:03,385
to kill the president of Russia

199
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:09,141
at the funeral of
the American vice president.

200
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,771
Chenkov is KA 12.

201
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,608
"KA."
Cold War legend.

202
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,610
Highly trained
Russian sleeper agents

203
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,655
inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

204
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,783
Supposedly they'd wait years
to strike. Decades, even.

205
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,828
Mm. Supposedly.

206
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:33,040
What, you don't believe in moles?
I believe in moles, all right.

207
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,541
Just not the bogeyman.

208
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,669
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

209
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,755
This guy's selling smoke.

210
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,840
Wrap it up, Ev.

211
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:47,304
So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? Is that it?

212
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,015
Mm-hm. Okay.

213
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,434
Thank you very much.

214
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:56,188
And what would you like
in return for that information?

215
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,066
I simply wish to help you do

216
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,652
what you need to do.

217
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,114
You're good.

218
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,994
The KA program
is brilliant bullshit.

219
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,206
But I'm officially off duty,

220
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,001
so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

221
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,254
Salt.
Yes?

222
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,758
The name of the Russian agent
is Salt.

223
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,386
Evelyn Salt.

224
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,724
My name is Evelyn Salt.

225
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,019
Then you are a Russian spy.

226
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,772
Truthful.

227
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:44,736
So far the fMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

228
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,616
Ted?

229
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,916
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

230
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,752
I need to get to the phone.
Not after the neural scan.

231
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,714
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

232
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,841
I am trained to, and so is he.

233
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,635
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

234
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,388
Let me call my husband.
Let me see it.

235
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,978
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

236
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,938
They don't just blow up their cover

237
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,608
they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

238
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,402
Do you remember Henley's wife?
Yes, I do.

239
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,070
Speaker.

240
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,033
Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks. Bye.

241
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,911
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

242
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,121
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

243
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,624
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

244
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,795
Someone interrogate that
piece of shit. Someone
who enjoys getting answers.

245
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,465
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

246
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:50,427
I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
I didn't say you were.

247
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,721
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

248
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,974
No, no. We gotta go to
a secure location. Now.

249
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,434
All right.

250
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,312
Doesn't get any more secure
than this.

251
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,649
Ev? Five minutes.

252
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,487
Call Protective Services, find Mike.
I will.

253
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,822
This is bullshit.

254
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,662
Give us a sec,
we'll be right in.

255
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,290
I know we're heading
into your jurisdiction.

256
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,251
I'm just asking for five minutes.
No.

257
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,219
If I have to. You can't have
five minutes. I have to talk to her.

258
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,805
She's scared. Don't you see that?
I don't care.

259
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,350
There is a mole
in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. I am sure.

260
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,407
Please step in the elevator.

261
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:22,060
--Russian president, okay? So I'm
gonna ask you to step out of my way.

262
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,402
What the hell is that?

263
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,029
Sir.

264
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,865
I gotta pee.

265
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,993
Where do you think he went?

266
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,205
No one saw him coming
out the front.

267
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,874
Jesus Christ.
Here he is again.

268
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,877
No sign of him so far on the street.

269
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,838
It's two minutes ago,
before lockdown.

270
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,632
Anything clean on him?
We just got a match, sir.

271
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,509
It's May Day, 1981.

272
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,886
There's Brezhnev. And there...

273
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,179
Orlov.
That's him.

274
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,224
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

275
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,476
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter,

276
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,688
airport, train station,
taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

277
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:51,024
Get me Medford on a secure line.
Yes, sir.

278
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,903
Top-right screen. Is that live?
Yes, sir.

279
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,405
Where is she going? Track her.

280
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:01,076
No one may leave the building.

281
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,495
Rink Petroleum, Security.

282
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:06,582
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

283
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,254
We lost the visual on her.
Damn it. Where'd she go?

284
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,256
We are on security lockdoWn.

285
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,259
Dave? It's Evelyn, is Mike there?

286
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,928
No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.

287
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,513
Hey, happy anniversary, huh?

288
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,348
The stairwell.

289
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,059
Second floor.
What's on that floor?

290
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,896
It's empty, a security buffer.
Isolate and seal it.

291
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,363
Get her records to my handheld.

292
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,242
East corridor.

293
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,958
Notifying Metropolitan Police.

294
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,552
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

295
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,017
We got her.

296
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,520
Locking down all floors.

297
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,105
Security Protective Service
responding to threat.

298
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,362
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

299
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,697
Yes, sir.
Director Medford, sir.

300
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,699
Get me a side arm.

301
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,827
I'll call her back.

302
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,794
Shit.
Lost visual.

303
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,713
Where is she, Albert?
Talk to me.

304
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,007
Come on.

305
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,725
North hallway.

306
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,451
There, interrogation room,
bring it up.

307
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,408
Switch down, switch down.

308
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,415
Have you found him?

309
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,417
What the hell are you doing, Ev?

310
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,752
This doesn't look good.

311
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,670
Let's do it.
Move.

312
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,298
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

313
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,925
Get your panties off the camera.

314
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,260
Get where We can see you
so you don't get hurt.

315
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,430
Have you found my husband?
These boys aren't fooling around.

316
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,771
Please. I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

317
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,481
Call me when you find Mike.

318
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,942
SWeeping corridors
outside the elevator.

319
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,657
Put the masks on.

320
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,116
Situation is hot.

321
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,462
Open the door about tWo feet.
We 're gonna gas her.

322
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,631
Tac team in position.
Waiting for a go.

323
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,007
Is that absolutely necessary?

324
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,968
What, you want me to shoot her?

325
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,345
Get a medical team in place now.

326
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,569
We're ready.

327
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,991
Now.

328
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,833
Okay, on my count.

329
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,545
Three, two, one. Go.

330
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:29,845
Jesus Christ.

331
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,904
Where is she? Come on, guys.

332
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,948
Find her, Albert. Now.
Suspect has escaped.

333
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,159
There. Bring that up.

334
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,080
Stay with her,
she's crossing the street.

335
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,749
Pan the goddamn camera.

336
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,387
Back that up and zoom in.

337
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,097
We're looking for Michael Krause.

338
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,724
Freeze.

339
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,185
We're looking for her husband, Mike.

340
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,561
What the hell are you doing, Ev?

341
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,564
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

342
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,359
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

343
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,445
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

344
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,364
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes away.

345
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,491
We can cover it,
but she won't go there.

346
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:35,327
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

347
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,037
Okay.

348
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,914
Taxi!

349
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,378
U Street. I'll tell you when to stop.

350
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:56,223
Hi, this is Mike. Please leave
a message after the tone.

351
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:25,169
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Ev,

352
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:28,422
and as such, enjoys pretty much
unrestricted access

353
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,008
to the borders of North Korea.

354
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:35,053
So brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

355
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:39,141
He's the perfect cover
to get us inside.

356
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:20,432
Mike?

357
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:26,021
Mike? Honey?

358
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,404
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

359
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,532
It's all right. Shh.

360
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,868
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

361
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:15,070
Come on. Come on.

362
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,870
Check for back eXits.

363
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,431
Go! Go!

364
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,687
Bedroom, clear!

365
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,065
Kitchen is clear.

366
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,861
Office, clear!

367
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,780
Living room, clear!

368
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,601
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

369
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,172
Come here.

370
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,758
What are you doing?

371
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,427
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

372
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:05,097
Did it ever occur to you that
that Russian was lying?

373
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,765
Why'd she run?
I don't know.

374
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:09,852
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

375
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,104
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

376
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:14,523
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

377
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,358
"Maybe" is your department.

378
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,194
Mine is catching her
so we can find out.

379
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,030
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

380
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,324
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

381
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,536
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

382
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:28,912
Should it?

383
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,750
Is your mom home?
No.

384
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,544
No? Can you do me a favor?
Yeah.

385
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,880
Hi. You baby-sit Burt for me?

386
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:42,050
Oh, yeah.
Yeah? Here's some money for food.

387
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:43,969
Hi, Burt.

388
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:45,929
What you doing?
You doing homework?

389
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,140
Yeah, math.

390
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,977
Algebra.
I hate math.

391
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,073
Hi. Nice to see you again.

392
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,827
You talking to me?
Yeah, I've seen you here before.

393
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:13,332
Yeah, I-- Yeah, I come here a lot.

394
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,499
You?

395
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,168
Oh, I'm working here.

396
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:17,544
At the museum.

397
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,589
I'm an arachnologist.
A what?

398
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:23,008
A spider hunter.

399
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,512
You look like one.

400
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:34,269
There are 40,000 species of spiders
in the world.

401
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,981
And that one is mine.

402
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,191
You discovered it.

403
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,609
Inside North Korea.

404
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:46,281
I named it Terrijoolsima peterbesti.

405
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,535
Do you get that?

406
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,579
No. Should I?

407
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:55,415
Peterbesti? I named it
after Pete Best.

408
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,125
The first drummer
before Ringo.

409
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:01,463
Best never was a famous Beatle,

410
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:07,302
but now he's a famous spider.

411
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,825
I got her.

412
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:32,744
She's heading north
towards the Metro station.

413
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:34,496
Ev!

414
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,397
Ev!

415
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,951
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

416
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:18,373
Excuse me.

417
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,054
Will do. Headed there noW.

418
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,931
There she is.

419
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:37,392
All teams, southbound
toward the bridge. Box her in.

420
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,321
Circle around!

421
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,240
Salt! Stop!

422
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,700
Keep her in your sights!
Coming up behind you!

423
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,244
Fuck!

424
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:01,250
Keep back! Hold your fire!

425
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,627
Salt! Down!

426
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,922
Salt!

427
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,721
Spread out!

428
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:17,933
Salt!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

429
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,227
On the ground. Now!
Please don't. No!

430
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,438
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

431
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:24,815
I have to find my husband.

432
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,775
Why'd you run?
To find my husband!

433
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,735
That's not a reason.
Don't shoot.

434
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,279
Stay back!
Last chance.

435
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:32,948
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

436
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:35,450
Don't make me put you down.
Put the gun down!

437
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,160
Give yourself up!
Come on, Ev.

438
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,872
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, I promise.

439
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,292
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

440
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,086
Somebody's going to try to
kill the Russian president.

441
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,006
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

442
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,466
There's nowhere to run! Quit now!

443
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:52,968
No, I didn't do anything.

444
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:54,511
Get back! No!

445
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,147
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

446
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:07,149
Get a roadblock in place now.

447
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,163
Metro Police on alert.

448
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:02,371
There she is. On the tanker.

449
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,082
Stop. Stop!

450
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,010
Ev!

451
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,320
You, my friend, have got
a mole in your group.

452
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:38,740
We don't know that yet.
I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar

453
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,618
and everything she's said
has been to protect her cover.

454
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,413
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

455
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,257
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

456
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:57,861
Okay, take it down.

457
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,706
Shit!

458
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,044
Shit!

459
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:21,677
Okay.

460
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,471
Ted, I know you're her friend,

461
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,099
but we gotta drop a net
on New York.

462
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,352
We gotta do it now.
Let's go!

463
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:36,441
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

464
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:40,362
Tell them Salt might be
coming their way.

465
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:46,243
And if she is,
Orlov may not
be far behind either.

466
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,288
You seen this?

467
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:51,874
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

468
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:56,336
She was in a car accident with
her parents in '88. They both died.

469
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:02,384
They were teachers at
the U.S. Embassy for
the American children of the staff.

470
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,512
That's why we
put her on Russia
in the first place.

471
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,559
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

472
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:14,229
Send everything we've got on Orlov
to N.Y.P.D.

473
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,870
And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up

474
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:14,665
and preparations are continuing
well into the night

475
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,918
for the funeral of
Vice President MaxWell Oates.

476
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:22,631
Among the dignitaries attending the
service at St. BartholomeW's Church

477
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,259
is Russian president
Boris Matveyev,

478
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,928
who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.

479
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:33,058
Public transportation will experience
delays, with subway closures and...

480
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,105
Evelyn.

481
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:40,315
Look at me.

482
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,153
If there was a way,
I would kill them.

483
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,950
You shouldn't have come here.

484
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,661
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

485
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,540
Now they know who you are.

486
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,584
Who?

487
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,420
Evelyn.

488
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,464
Who?

489
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:08,802
I would accept
anything about you,

490
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,721
but I need to know.

491
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,974
So look at me. Look at me.

492
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,645
Just tell me, okay?

493
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,314
Just tell me.

494
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:24,568
I work...

495
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:27,487
I work for the CIA.

496
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,992
So you see, there's...

497
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,913
There's no future for us.

498
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:41,001
You're not safe with me.

499
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:44,505
I don't wanna be safe.

500
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,717
I know you,

501
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:51,553
and I wanna be with you.

502
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:56,350
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

503
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,811
Okay?

504
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,650
Okay. Okay.

505
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:28,590
Welcome to New York,
Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

506
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:30,884
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

507
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,219
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

508
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,395
I'll put these in the closet, sir?

509
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,188
Yeah, fine.

510
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:12,027
I do solemnly swear

511
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:13,695
I do solemnly swear

512
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:20,869
that I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

513
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,372
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

514
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,333
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

515
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,335
That I will faithfully discharge

516
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,170
That I will faithfully discharge

517
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,881
the duties of the office
on which I'm about to enter.

518
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:36,093
the duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

519
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,555
So help me God.
So help me God.

520
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:47,813
A solemn day here in New York City.

521
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,899
The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates,

522
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:54,778
a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold War warrior

523
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:57,322
whose greatest legacy
may be as architect

524
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:00,784
of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

525
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,953
Russian president Boris Matveyev

526
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,914
has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer

527
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:10,294
to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the West.

528
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:10,479
What's the
security perimeter?

529
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:13,690
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

530
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:17,194
And those are
Secret Service agents,
not CIA.

531
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,822
So relax.
That's real funny.

532
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,534
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

533
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,622
Detail, halt.

534
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,043
Forward, march.

535
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:54,314
Due to the funeral,
the 51 st Street station is closed.

536
00:46:57,651 --> 00:47:02,823
Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51 st Street station is closed.

537
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,079
What--? Hey, what's going on?

538
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,664
Hey! There's smoke.

539
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,961
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

540
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:52,748
Eleanor. Good to see you.

541
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,042
Thank you.

542
00:47:57,836 --> 00:48:01,006
Boris.
Mr. President.

543
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,845
Hello.

544
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:20,067
Please be seated.

545
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,665
Stand by for president's speech.

546
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:40,838
Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.

547
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:43,590
Mrs. Oates.

548
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:48,762
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald...

549
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:53,016
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

550
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,353
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

551
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:05,362
I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.

552
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:07,823
As vice president,

553
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:12,536
he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

554
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:14,329
And today,

555
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:19,251
the world says goodbye
to a great man.

556
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:30,220
I'll check the back.

557
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,723
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

558
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:01,084
My friendship with Maxwell Oates

559
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:04,254
began in the unlikeliest of places:

560
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,298
Lima Zulu 4, come in.

561
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:08,342
Across the negotiating table...

562
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,260
What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?

563
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:11,637
We got two M lAs.

564
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:16,934
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel
outside the crypt entrance
and Lima Zulu 5.

565
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,229
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

566
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:22,022
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.

567
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:25,317
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

568
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:26,568
Converge on the crypt.

569
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:28,779
He made all the difference,
and for that,

570
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:33,825
he will always have
my respect and admiration.

571
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,624
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

572
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:30,591
What's going on?

573
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,978
Matveyev.

574
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:45,022
Get goddamn Matveyev.

575
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:02,831
Get the bomb squad in here!
Go, go!

576
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,248
Drop it!

577
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,292
Drop it!

578
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:57,511
Any MTs down here?
I see her.

579
00:52:57,678 --> 00:53:00,430
Keep your hands up!
Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

580
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:03,851
Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
Don't move!

581
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,228
Do not move! Do not move!
Keep your hands up!

582
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,021
Take her down, take her down!

583
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:09,648
Check for other weapons.

584
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:13,068
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

585
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:15,070
I can't feel a pulse.

586
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,365
Jurisdiction is clear.
This is New York City.

587
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:20,993
N.Y.P.D. has her.
She's going to 1 Police Plaza.

588
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:23,704
I'm not arguing jurisdiction.
We don't know yet, sir.

589
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,456
The shooter is CIA. I know her.
Yes, I'll be there.

590
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,083
I'll be on
the next chopper out.

591
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,378
Have your superior call the mayor.
Open up, guy, open up.

592
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,423
Back it up! Back it up!

593
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,551
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

594
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,137
Let's go, let's go.

595
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,930
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

596
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,348
Back up!
Keep moving.

597
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:44,600
Sir, back up!

598
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:47,519
Why? Why?!

599
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:51,815
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

600
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:53,567
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

601
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,777
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark hole!

602
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:57,446
Get ahold of yourself.

603
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,615
Get the door, get the door.

604
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:02,451
Get off me!
Back off, man! Back off!

605
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:03,952
That's it. Let's go.

606
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:06,914
Stand back.

607
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:10,167
Close it! Go, go, go!

608
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,974
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

609
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:27,726
Jesus Christ.

610
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:29,311
Yeah.

611
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,647
You were right about her.

612
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:35,150
She had the drop on me, Ted.

613
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:38,237
Why didn't she shoot?

614
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:05,472
Natasha.

615
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:07,850
Natasha.

616
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,768
Is that you?

617
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:13,021
Did they give you a new face?

618
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:16,859
I'm going home tomorrow,
Shnaider.

619
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,861
Home to Grozny?

620
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:23,282
My home is in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.

621
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:28,912
My favorite place there
is McDonald's on Fern Street

622
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,415
because it's near the river.

623
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,751
But I won't want to go there
anymore

624
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:38,088
because my mother and father
are dead.

625
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,965
Natasha,

626
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,343
will you miss me?

627
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:48,640
My name is Evelyn Salt.

628
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,079
Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

629
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:03,632
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

630
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:06,635
Right now! Hands in the air!

631
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:27,364
Hey, did you see that?
Hey, get those guys over here.

632
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:29,825
Get them over here to help.

633
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,426
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

634
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:24,171
What college will you attend?

635
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:26,215
Princeton University.

636
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:27,549
Where will you work?

637
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:29,718
The Central Intelligence Agency.

638
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:31,637
Who will you trust?

639
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:33,514
No one.

640
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,058
Be very patient.

641
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,935
Remember your training.

642
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:42,105
Remember, you're not the only one.

643
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:43,899
There are many others.

644
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:47,361
All of you waiting to strike.

645
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:49,613
Yes.
And we will strike.

646
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:53,492
Together.
Yes.

647
00:58:56,078 --> 00:58:57,579
Wait.

648
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:04,253
One day,
I will come for all of you.

649
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,094
Hello, Evelyn.

650
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,597
I'm Martin Crenshaw
from the U.S. Embassy.

651
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:19,685
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

652
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:30,612
Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their neW leader's words

653
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:34,283
and called on him to take strong
action against What they are calling

654
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:38,078
a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U. S.

655
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,289
These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks

656
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:43,625
of anti-American protests
across Russia.

657
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:46,962
"We will strike back,"
says the new Russian president,

658
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:49,548
angrily condemning
today's assassination

659
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:53,177
by American intelligence officer
Evelyn Salt.

660
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,347
As the body of slain
President Matveyev is
on its Way back to Moscow,

661
00:59:57,514 --> 01:00:00,100
anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia,

662
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,978
with bombings of U. S. diplomats'
cars in Moscow.

663
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:07,232
The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.

664
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,444
Responding to
a rapidly escalating crisis,

665
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:13,822
President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting

666
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:17,409
with cabinet members, military
leaders and NA TO representatives.

667
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:20,495
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

668
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:29,588
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

669
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:39,723
You were not supposed
to get married.

670
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:44,311
Not unless it had
great tactical advantage.

671
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:46,188
I did it to seem normal.

672
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,024
When you escaped today, I thought:

673
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:53,362
"Even I could not have hoped
for so much."

674
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:57,407
You are my greatest creation.

675
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:00,744
You trained me well.

676
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:40,367
My husband, you have him?

677
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:42,911
I had to be certain.

678
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:45,163
But now you trust me?

679
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,373
Completely.

680
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:58,510
So tell me what's next.

681
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,013
Next, part two:

682
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:05,517
We seize control of
this country's atomic weapons.

683
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:07,811
How?

684
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,605
You'll see.

685
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,191
All right.

686
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,030
Are you ready to watch him die?

687
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:09,540
Give me the gun.

688
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,460
That would be too easy.

689
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,813
Satisfied?

690
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:17,524
I'm satisfied.

691
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,195
Comrades,

692
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:25,115
our sister has rejoined us.

693
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:28,577
Russia will rise from the ashes

694
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:32,206
of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

695
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:36,043
And the world will hear us!

696
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:37,878
Will hear.

697
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,716
Welcome back to our family, sister.

698
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:46,720
Sister.

699
01:04:54,895 --> 01:05:00,817
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

700
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:07,241
You're to meet an agent,
NATO uniform,
at a plane here.

701
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:13,372
Tail number N182SL.

702
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:18,919
Final instructions will come from him.

703
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:22,214
That's it.
That's it.

704
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:25,425
After this, we go dark.

705
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:28,220
Radio silent.

706
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:31,014
You won't hear from me again,

707
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:32,850
my daughter.

708
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,973
Forever and ever.

709
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,540
Have you heard from Orlov?

710
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:03,876
Yes. Last word was "go."

711
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,382
Chenkov.

712
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:13,552
Do you remember me?

713
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,017
Chenkov.

714
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:23,061
Did you miss me?

715
01:08:23,604 --> 01:08:24,813
Shnaider?

716
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,652
How long have you been here?

717
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:37,117
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

718
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:40,996
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

719
01:08:41,413 --> 01:08:44,082
Colonel Edward Tomas.

720
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,586
And you are my attache.

721
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:49,421
Your ID.

722
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,424
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

723
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:55,511
More importantly, our mission.

724
01:08:55,886 --> 01:09:00,307
The bunker eight stories
below the White House.

725
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:04,019
That's where the president
needs to be.

726
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:10,442
How do we do it?

727
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:14,696
Don't worry, he'll be there.
That's my job.
I'll make sure he's there.

728
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:18,992
What's my job?
Do you remember, Chenkov,

729
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:22,913
when we were young and you
had to finish first in everything?

730
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,831
Had to be the best
at everything.

731
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,044
Though you knew you would
be beaten with a cane,
you had to finish first.

732
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:30,796
I remember.

733
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:34,466
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

734
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:41,473
Tonight you will kill
America's president.

735
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:56,154
IDs, please.

736
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:58,949
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

737
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:00,868
I'll check the side.

738
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:05,163
Control, this is Hayes.

739
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,208
I have a Colonel Tomas
and a Major Vicek.

740
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,710
Undercarriage is clean.

741
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:12,004
Back's clean.

742
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:16,633
Colonel. Major. All clear.

743
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:31,148
You know the drill, colonel.

744
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:34,902
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

745
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:38,071
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

746
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,702
Step through, please, sir.

747
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:48,790
Turn around.

748
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:53,879
Thank you.

749
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:01,136
Step through. Arms out.
Patience is key.

750
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:04,389
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here longer.

751
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:06,892
What others?
I don't know.

752
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:10,229
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

753
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:13,857
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

754
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:15,734
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

755
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,110
Major Vicek.
Pleasure.

756
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:20,197
You'll have minutes to preview
NATO's point of view
before the meeting.

757
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,535
Now, Ted, your Russian
CI agent, Salt.

758
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,038
What can you tell us about her?
We think she may be a Soviet plant,

759
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:33,919
inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

760
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:38,257
A day marking the start of a large
strike against the U.S. and her allies.

761
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:48,016
This should be
the president now.

762
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:53,146
You have a big job, Chenkov,

763
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:54,606
but you can do it.

764
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,109
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

765
01:11:57,401 --> 01:11:59,152
Home.

766
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:01,071
I'm going home.

767
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,952
Down! Take cover!
Get the president!

768
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,580
A gun! He's got a gun!
Get back!

769
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:13,208
Get back!

770
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:27,806
Are you okay, sir?
Yes.

771
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:30,726
Goddamn it.
Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

772
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:37,566
Help, over here!

773
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,154
Get a medic! Get a medic!

774
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:51,330
I think I saw her.

775
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:53,373
You saw who?

776
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:56,627
Salt.

777
01:12:57,753 --> 01:12:59,379
I think I saw her in the corridor.

778
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:03,425
The other NATO officer.

779
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:08,055
She's here.

780
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:10,724
Check.

781
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:12,267
Clear.
Move.

782
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,019
Go!

783
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:16,772
We may have a visual
on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

784
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:20,108
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

785
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:24,571
This is not a drill.
The White House is under attack.

786
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:28,617
If you are near an exit,
please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.

787
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,577
This is not a drill.

788
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:33,413
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

789
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:37,709
Command, this is Jenks. I need
the PEOC bunker up and running.

790
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:40,254
If this was authorized
by the Russian government,

791
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,965
it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

792
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:48,387
If you are near an exit,
please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.

793
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:50,472
This is not a drill.

794
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:52,307
Clear!
Let's go, sir.

795
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,603
Alpha team!

796
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:01,942
Move, move.

797
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:03,944
Close it.

798
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:05,612
Close it.

799
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,622
Please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.

800
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:17,875
This is not a drill.

801
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:50,365
Go, go.

802
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:54,828
Geronimo approaching
bunker door
in five seconds.

803
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:00,959
Clear.

804
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:10,219
Any chance she could follow?

805
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:12,471
My own men couldn't
get through that door.

806
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:15,307
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

807
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:20,687
Okay, go.

808
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:24,191
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

809
01:15:28,111 --> 01:15:30,072
Geronimo secured.

810
01:15:58,517 --> 01:16:00,519
Get me Director Medford.
Yes, sir.

811
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:04,398
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility

812
01:16:04,565 --> 01:16:07,442
that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

813
01:16:08,151 --> 01:16:10,654
Mr. President,
Director Medford is up.

814
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:13,407
Marion, what's the situation?

815
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:16,577
It should be coming up
on one of your screens.

816
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,413
What you see there
represents temperature drops

817
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,748
in mobile missile units in Siberia.

818
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:25,752
It means the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.

819
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:29,506
And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.

820
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:34,178
Mr. President, I strongly
recommend we go from
DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

821
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:36,763
At least at our forward bases.

822
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:39,558
Do it.

823
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,102
And since the Russians
have deployed,

824
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:46,023
we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

825
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,276
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

826
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:53,322
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

827
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:15,135
Sir.

828
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:21,266
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

829
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:24,186
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

830
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:26,980
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

831
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:31,276
Command, our eyes are down.
We have a PEOC
outer security door malfunction.

832
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:33,403
Get out there now.

833
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,447
Seal this room.

834
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,117
Down that corridor. Secure it.

835
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:26,874
Victims are being taken to
George Washington Hospital.

836
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,086
Reports are coming in that there
are casualties at the White House.

837
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:34,339
This is President Howard Lewis.

838
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:38,343
Proceed with authentication.
Y es, Mr. President.

839
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:44,474
Ready to commence authentication.

840
01:18:44,641 --> 01:18:45,642
Zulu.

841
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:46,852
Tango.
Echo.

842
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:48,020
Seven.
Niner.

843
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:49,396
Juliett.
X-ray.

844
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:50,564
Sierra.
Seven.

845
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:51,732
Alfa.
Mike.

846
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:53,567
Charlie.
Whiskey.

847
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:54,735
Five.
Six.

848
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:55,903
Tango.

849
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,030
Authentication codes confirmed.

850
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:00,574
It's all yours now, Mr. President.

851
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,451
God be with you.

852
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:07,289
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

853
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:09,416
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

854
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:12,836
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

855
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:17,466
Is the camera outside
this door working? Put it up.

856
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:19,676
Officer Dryer, what's your status?

857
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:22,429
Officer Dryer, come in.

858
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:25,390
Federal Communication Commission

859
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:27,601
is activating
the Emergency Alert System.

860
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:29,353
Who the hell's that?

861
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:33,065
That's her. That's Evelyn Salt.

862
01:19:33,232 --> 01:19:34,942
She's in. Go to DEFCON 1.

863
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,610
Give me your side arm.

864
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:40,322
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

865
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:42,199
Screw protocol.
We got an enemy agent.

866
01:19:42,366 --> 01:19:44,326
Protocol is protocol, sir.

867
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,496
And dead is dead.

868
01:19:48,247 --> 01:19:49,915
Behind me!

869
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,001
I'm the national security advisor.

870
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:54,503
Not anymore.

871
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:03,470
Sit down.

872
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:07,850
Who are you?

873
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:11,353
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

874
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:15,107
And unless you do
exactly as I say,

875
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,860
I will be the last person
you will ever see.

876
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:26,201
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

877
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:27,828
Go to hell.

878
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:58,025
Selective attack options ready.

879
01:20:58,233 --> 01:20:59,651
Ted?

880
01:20:59,818 --> 01:21:04,948
Emergency action message
released by...

881
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:08,577
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

882
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:10,871
Why didn't you tell me?

883
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:15,667
I tried many times, but...

884
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:19,213
My loneliness was my only friend.

885
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:22,090
You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.

886
01:21:22,257 --> 01:21:24,218
I was a class ahead, comrade.

887
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:26,678
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

888
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:29,765
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

889
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,683
Excuse me.

890
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:35,896
Selective attack targets acquired.

891
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:38,690
Tehran.

892
01:21:39,024 --> 01:21:40,442
Mecca.

893
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:44,238
Mecca? T ehran?

894
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:46,073
Part two of our plan.

895
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,200
Kill nine million people.

896
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,369
Enrage a billion Muslims.

897
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,372
America will suffer a painful death.

898
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:57,876
Permissive action links initiated.

899
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:01,588
Missiles arming.

900
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:10,222
Nuclear command

901
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:13,225
posts airborne.

902
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:14,726
Let me join you.

903
01:22:16,144 --> 01:22:19,064
ICMs set to

904
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:21,692
maximum yield.

905
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:26,113
You know, when you first came
to Langley,

906
01:22:26,738 --> 01:22:29,199
I didn't think I'd be able
to do it.

907
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:32,286
I didn't think I'd be able to

908
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:35,998
resist the temptation
to say something.

909
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:39,001
Then you met Mike and,

910
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:43,422
well, things changed.

911
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:47,801
Let me join you.

912
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:53,265
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

913
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:01,607
Let me join you.

914
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:04,484
I want to be with you.

915
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:20,626
The man
we thought Was dead has made
a resurrection that is miraculous.

916
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,503
President Matveyev is alive.

917
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:24,796
We 're going to Russia.
What you are seeing

918
01:23:24,963 --> 01:23:27,424
are live pictures of
Russian president Matveyev

919
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:31,470
arriving at the airport outside
of MoscoW. This is astonishing.

920
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:34,848
According to his doctors,
President Matveyev's
mistaken death

921
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:37,392
is attributed to
a temporary paralysis

922
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:40,103
from a toxin
derived from spider venom.

923
01:23:40,312 --> 01:23:44,483
A recap for those Who may
not have been following
the events of the day...

924
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:49,738
At least I was rig ht.

925
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:56,119
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

926
01:23:56,411 --> 01:24:00,165
I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

927
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:02,501
You were supposed to
recruit him, Ev,

928
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:04,294
not fall in love with him.

929
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:07,673
That's why I told Orlov
to pick him up.

930
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:12,427
By the way, how is Mike?

931
01:24:14,388 --> 01:24:16,473
Orlov is dead.

932
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:23,230
Well, that's good news.

933
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,940
Saved me the trouble.

934
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:31,029
I had to practically twist his arm to
get him to blow your cover at the CIA.

935
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:36,326
You see, he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

936
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:41,790
But you needed somebody
to take the blame.

937
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,085
I'm the patsy.

938
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,757
And I'm the hero.

939
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:55,429
Congratulations, Ev.

940
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:59,641
You're about to become famous.

941
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:36,929
Identity confirmation requested.

942
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:52,402
Identity confirmation requested.

943
01:25:57,407 --> 01:25:59,034
Identity confirmed.

944
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:18,095
Minuteman lll lCBMs' batteries
up to poWer.

945
01:26:57,467 --> 01:26:59,761
Authorization, 9 percent.

946
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:07,936
Go!

947
01:27:08,145 --> 01:27:10,939
Permissive action links initiated.

948
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:14,776
Trident submarines
at firing readiness.

949
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:16,612
Permission to launch.

950
01:27:17,988 --> 01:27:19,281
Permission to launch.

951
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:50,312
Get down on the floor, now!

952
01:27:51,063 --> 01:27:52,439
I said now!

953
01:27:57,444 --> 01:28:00,072
Launch sequence aborted.
Systems restored.

954
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,574
Move, move, move!
Show me your hands!

955
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:04,868
Get down!
What is your name, sir?

956
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,913
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

957
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:11,291
Mr. President.

958
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,045
Mr. President, can you hear me?

959
01:28:16,672 --> 01:28:18,507
Hold still.
EMT's on the way.

960
01:28:18,674 --> 01:28:20,592
Make sure they got body bags.
At least seven.

961
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:22,302
She's wearing a vest.

962
01:28:22,678 --> 01:28:25,472
I'll meet you in five minutes.
I wanna get cleaned up.

963
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:27,224
And I want her alone in a room.

964
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:29,852
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

965
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:33,689
She won't talk. She's trained not to,
no matter what we do to her.

966
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:36,108
If we're gonna
find these people,
we gotta do it.

967
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:38,485
Somebody already did.
At least some of them.

968
01:28:38,652 --> 01:28:41,530
Barge on the East River.
Twelve dead, including Orlov.

969
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:43,365
Who did that?

970
01:28:45,534 --> 01:28:47,536
Don't know. Forensics are on it.

971
01:28:49,413 --> 01:28:51,665
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
I'll be right back.

972
01:28:58,046 --> 01:29:02,301
Well, sir, you're injured.
Why don't you have a seat?
We'll take a look at you.

973
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,720
Are you okay?

974
01:29:05,554 --> 01:29:07,890
Pretty good gash there.

975
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:10,684
Looks like you got a piece
of glass in there.

976
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,876
She killed someone else.

977
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:38,712
It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.

978
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:49,890
Check him. Check him!

979
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:51,725
Checking vitals.

980
01:29:51,892 --> 01:29:54,686
I'm not getting a pulse.
I'm not getting much.

981
01:30:17,876 --> 01:30:19,545
Sit down.

982
01:30:20,796 --> 01:30:23,340
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

983
01:30:23,507 --> 01:30:25,926
Give me your hands.
Then she's the FBl's.

984
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:12,097
Hey.

985
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:14,725
Why'd you kill him?

986
01:31:15,017 --> 01:31:16,518
Because somebody had to.

987
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,116
What?!

988
01:31:42,127 --> 01:31:45,047
By this, I take it you think
everybody is who
they say they are.

989
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:48,884
You knew something
was wrong the moment
Orlov walked in.

990
01:31:49,051 --> 01:31:50,469
So did l.

991
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:52,930
We just didn't know
what it was.

992
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:56,391
Winter did.
Winter?

993
01:31:58,227 --> 01:32:01,438
You expect me to believe
that Winter was gonna
launch the missiles

994
01:32:01,605 --> 01:32:03,524
and you saved the world?

995
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,819
I would like you
to believe that, yeah.

996
01:32:09,655 --> 01:32:11,240
That's a big accusation.

997
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:13,742
Well,

998
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:17,579
he's dead now
so he can't defend himself.

999
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:21,083
I guess you'll just have to
decide for yourself.

1000
01:32:28,215 --> 01:32:30,175
How many more like you
are there?

1001
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:32,427
Like me?

1002
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:35,264
None.

1003
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:37,349
Like him?

1004
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:39,893
More than you or I
can handle alone.

1005
01:32:42,604 --> 01:32:45,274
You really think
a trained Soviet agent

1006
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:50,028
couldn't kill the Russian
president at point-blank
range if she wanted to?

1007
01:32:54,157 --> 01:32:56,451
Or you, for that matter.

1008
01:32:57,119 --> 01:32:59,413
I could've killed you
at the funeral
and I didn't.

1009
01:32:59,913 --> 01:33:02,457
You surrendered to me
because I gave you no choice.

1010
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:04,543
You know better.

1011
01:33:05,544 --> 01:33:07,796
I had a choice.

1012
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:09,590
You know better.

1013
01:33:29,818 --> 01:33:32,070
If I did believe you,

1014
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:36,033
and I'm not saying for a second
that I do, but if I did,

1015
01:33:37,951 --> 01:33:39,661
nobody else would.

1016
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:44,499
Well, maybe you can
think of a way around that.

1017
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:58,388
They took everything from me.

1018
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,934
I'll kill them.

1019
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:18,367
ETA, four minutes.

1020
01:34:25,374 --> 01:34:26,458
Bullshit!

1021
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:42,224
We are approaching the Potomac,
heading due south and west.

1022
01:34:47,896 --> 01:34:49,565
Go get them.

1023
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:11,003
Salt!

1024
01:35:19,678 --> 01:35:23,140
Circle back! Circle back!

1025
01:36:19,488 --> 01:36:22,115
New U.S. President Joseph Steppens
announced today

1026
01:36:22,282 --> 01:36:24,284
that with the death of
Natasha Chenkov,

1027
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:28,163
known in the U. S. as Evelyn Salt,
all elements of the terrorist group

1028
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:30,666
have been eliminated.
The announcement came

1029
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:32,709
during his Moscow
peacekeeping visit

1030
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:35,295
where President Steppens paused
to lay floWers

1031
01:36:35,462 --> 01:36:40,092
at the site of the 1974 plane crash
that killed his parents and sister

1032
01:36:40,259 --> 01:36:42,886
while on a tour of Russia.
