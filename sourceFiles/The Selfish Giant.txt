1
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,695
Can't stand you!

2
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,613
Bastard!

3
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,613
- Chill out.

4
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,614
It's me.

5
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,992
- Calm down, Arbor.

6
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,285
- Fucking get off!

7
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,619
- Just chill.

8
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,620
Arbor.

9
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,787
- Get off!

10
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:23,331
Get off!

11
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:24,416
- Arbor, it's me.

12
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:26,751
It's Swifty.

13
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:30,880
- Chill out.

14
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:36,385
You're off your head, you,
aren't you?

15
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:39,929
Fucking mad head, you.

16
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,267
Gonna come out?

17
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,379
- Want some?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:22,842
Here.

19
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:24,344
- Friends.

20
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,304
- Friends.

21
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,018
- What are them torches
down there?

22
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:40,399
- Is that railway
people or pol-

23
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:42,860
- Shit. Get down.

24
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,860
Get down.

25
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,239
What are they doing?

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,907
- Fuck knows.
Should I go have a look?

27
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:49,908
- No, wait here.

28
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,243
I want to see what
they're doing.

29
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:52,243
- Come on, we'll go look.

30
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:53,285
- Go on, then.

31
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,607
Oh, shit.

32
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,245
- Yeah.

33
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:30,954
I'm almost there, yeah.

34
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,959
Yeah.

35
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,294
Tools.

36
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:38,794
Definitely.

37
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,922
Get some of your boys
down here now, yeah?

38
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,091
- Oy! Fuck off!

39
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:51,765
- Hey!

40
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:54,935
Hey!
- Go, go, go!

41
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:56,977
- You thieving little bastards!

42
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:07,862
- Let us in!

43
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:13,992
- Oh, he's coming now.
He's got a big ax.

44
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,202
- We're not open yet!

45
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:16,203
Who the fuck are you?

46
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:17,371
What do you want?

47
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:20,373
Is that my-

48
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:22,542
What the fuck are you doing
with my fucking horse?

49
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,630
- What's that?
Where'd you get that?

50
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:28,588
- It's cable.

51
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,506
We found it.
- Oh, yeah?

52
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:32,175
Get off my fucking horse!

53
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,932
Take it inside.

54
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:54,236
- Would you put the ax down?

55
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:56,071
What the hell's going on?

56
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:58,240
- Found these two at the gate
with Tommy.

57
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:00,200
- We lent him,
went for a ride for a laugh.

58
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:01,409
Didn't know he were your horse.

59
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,910
He were tethered up
in that field.

60
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:04,328
We got you some cable, though,
don't we?

61
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,122
- Right, bring it in here.

62
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:08,833
- What?
- It's all right.

63
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,500
- Away, lad.
- Come on. Simba!

64
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:14,129
Come on!

65
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,630
Every twat knows,

66
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,299
you've got to strip it
before I can take it

67
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,549
'cause the number on casing.

68
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:39,401
See that?

69
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:42,445
Bright wire.

70
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,240
- You burn it off
if it's marked.

71
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,408
- What do you mean "marked"?

72
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,243
- That's what I mean, marked.

73
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,744
Look at yous.

74
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,454
All over you.

75
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,372
Hands.
- How did we get that?

76
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,624
- SmartWater.

77
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,126
Don't ever come back here
with that shite on you.

78
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,168
Out.

79
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,464
Here.

80
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:10,428
Go on.

81
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:16,058
- We'll strip it next time.

82
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:17,059
Do it proper.

83
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,185
Burn it off.

84
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,228
- There won't be a next time.

85
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,270
Now fuck off.

86
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:00,597
- You lot, up.

87
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,975
Fucking hell.

88
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,936
Have one
of your little freak-outs

89
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:08,563
last night, spazzy boy?

90
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,064
- Fuck off, you crackhead.

91
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,399
Tell you what.

92
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,567
This is the first night
I've not seen

93
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,026
you and your boyfriend
fucking spooning.

94
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:16,778
Why is this smelly pikey
on my floor, anyway?

95
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,779
What are you doing?

96
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:18,989
- Fuck off, you druggy bastard.

97
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,323
- "Fuck off,
you druggy bastard"?

98
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:21,991
How about you fuck off,
you pikey bastard?

99
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:23,117
- Martin!
- Get him a horse and cart...

100
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,493
- Leave him alone!
- And get him out the house.

101
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:25,661
Pikey scruff.
- Shut up!

102
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:27,663
Just ignore him Swifty, love.
You're always welcome here.

103
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:29,373
- I don't want a skanky Swift
in my house.

104
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:31,291
- Will you shut up?
It's not your house!

105
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:32,292
- I can smell him!

106
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,626
I can fucking smell him.
Move him.

107
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:34,794
- Will you get up?

108
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:36,296
We got an appointment
at clinic.

109
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:37,505
And no messing me about
this time.

110
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:38,547
You're going.

111
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:40,632
You two, can you get up, please?

112
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:42,176
Not again.

113
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:44,970
Truancy fine.

114
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,264
Sorry, Mum.

115
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:50,308
- I can't see no stains.

116
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,310
- Remember when Kitten put
that torch on us?

117
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:53,436
We could see it.

118
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:55,604
- What are you doing?
- Nowt.

119
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,647
- Since when did you put
your own clothes in wash?

120
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:58,648
- Don't know, Mum.

121
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,358
- Today.

122
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,902
- I earned you some money
for that fine.

123
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:03,235
- Where'd you get that?

124
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,528
- Just said I earned it.

125
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,322
- Tell me where you got it from!

126
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:08,657
I worked my arse off,
yeah, for this.

127
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:09,658
For you, yeah?

128
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,825
And you don't even accept it!

129
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,494
You ungrateful bastard!

130
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:13,495
- I'm not ungrateful.
- Fuck off!

131
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,913
- Arbor, I'm just saying.
- Fuck off!

132
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:15,914
Fuck's sake!

133
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,373
- I just want you to go-
- Fuck's sake!

134
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:18,708
- If you'd go to school
in first place-

135
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,708
- Don't want to!

136
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,710
- All right, all right!

137
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:23,086
Have you taken your tablet?

138
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:24,588
- Yeah, I fucking have!

139
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,798
- Has he?

140
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,799
Oh, not again.

141
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,132
Martin!

142
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:29,175
Get in here!

143
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:30,885
- What?
- Have you chorred his tablets?

144
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:32,011
- No.

145
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:33,638
- I can't believe you,
you selfish bastard!

146
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,097
- Don't fucking chat shit,
Arbor,

147
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,097
you little fucking muppet.

148
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,265
- As if I ain't got enough to do

149
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:38,308
without having to get
a repeat prescription.

150
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,268
- Are you gonna pin it on me now
'cause of this little spazzo?

151
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,937
- Fuck off now!

152
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:43,313
- What you doing, little prick!

153
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:44,980
- Martin, just get out.
Arbor!

154
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:46,190
- Fuck off!

155
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:47,358
- Fucking crackhead!

156
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,859
- All right, Arbor, listen.
Listen.

157
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,236
You'll just have
to get one at school, yeah?

158
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:51,237
- No!

159
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:52,737
- Arbor, I need you
to go to school.

160
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,240
Arbor, I need you
to go to school, yeah?

161
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:57,742
- Yeah! God's sake!
- Right, Swifty?

162
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:59,744
Can you get him to school,
please?

163
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,886
- Now just sip it with water.

164
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,391
Okay.

165
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,089
- Swifty.

166
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,016
Swifty.

167
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,816
- Right, Fenton, that's enough!

168
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,027
Where's that pencil?

169
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:27,279
Why don't you just leave him-

170
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,322
Pick that up.

171
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:29,615
- You.

172
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,949
- Pick that up now!

173
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,493
- Suck out, you little tramp.

174
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,494
- What did you just say?

175
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:35,495
- Fuck off.

176
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,079
- Oh, I see.
we're a bit special, are we?

177
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,372
I mean, maybe you can come and-

178
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,372
Since you're so special,

179
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,041
you can come and join me
at the table, no?

180
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,209
- No.

181
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,877
You stink.

182
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,045
- Ah, funny guy.

183
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,047
Get out your seat
and pick that up now!

184
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,047
- You pick it up.

185
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:50,674
- Stop laughing, everyone.

186
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:53,219
Fenton, pick it up, now!

187
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:56,679
Oy, yeah?
Funny, is it?

188
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:57,680
Fenton, come here.

189
00:11:57,722 --> 00:11:58,723
- Oy, quick!

190
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:00,475
- Fenton.

191
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:03,478
Fenton!

192
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,813
Study room!

193
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,397
- Every fucking day, man.

194
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:08,398
I hate the study room.

195
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,317
- You're not meant to like it.
- Shut up.

196
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:22,702
- Hey!

197
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,579
Get in here now.

198
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,128
- Here. Who's having this?

199
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,129
- What's up, mate?

200
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,631
- Beans again, Mum! Wow!

201
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:36,965
- Big boy, aren't you?

202
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,299
Hey, watch your language!

203
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,135
When you've got your food,
get in the living room.

204
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,553
- Take him in there,
will you, love?

205
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,388
- When you've got your food...
- Go on into living room.

206
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,389
- Where's my tea?

207
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,557
- Look at you.
You're useless, aren't you?

208
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:47,975
You're supposed
to put money aside

209
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,810
for the electric.

210
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,812
When you've got your food,
get in the living room.

211
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,646
- Right, go on.
Sit down and eat.

212
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,148
- It's cold!

213
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,315
- Yes, I know it's cold.

214
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,316
- Sit there.

215
00:12:58,526 --> 00:12:59,569
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

216
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,736
Clear off there.

217
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:01,778
Get off that settee.

218
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,238
And be quiet, the lot of you.

219
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,574
Quiet. Shh.

220
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:07,951
Hiya, mate, come in.
Come in.

221
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:12,997
There you go, mate.

222
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:14,331
300 quid.

223
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:18,002
- I'll give you 250 quid,
Price Drop.

224
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,127
- You want to sit down?

225
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,462
- Be no comebacks.
- No comebacks.

226
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:21,963
- No comebacks. 250.

227
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:22,964
Deal.

228
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,132
Hey, kids, away from there.

229
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:25,467
I need to get this out.

230
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:26,717
- Give it up, yous two.

231
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,553
- Hey, would you stop fighting
and sit down?

232
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:31,680
Sit down and eat your tea.

233
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:34,099
- It's not bleedin' funny.

234
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,433
You try lifting one of these.

235
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:36,601
- Ha-ha, ha-ha.

236
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:38,603
- Weakling!

237
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:39,937
- That's right.
Put it down.

238
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:40,980
Turn it round.
- Weakling!

239
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:42,523
- What we gonna sit on now?

240
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:43,732
- Just sit on the floor.
- Fuck!

241
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,233
- You watch your language, you.

242
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,985
- Can I go out, Mum?

243
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,489
Ah, me fucking leg!

244
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,491
You got me fucking arm trapped,
Price Drop.

245
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,825
Jesus!

246
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:00,455
Down here. Down here.

247
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:02,957
Fucking hell.

248
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:05,335
You get in and finish your tea!

249
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:11,381
Come on, let's get it shifted.

250
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:49,581
- Look at the state
of Swift's house.

251
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:50,958
It's fucking disgusting.

252
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,919
- Mate, you're gonna get
lurgy now.

253
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:54,920
- Yeah, he's gonna start

254
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,422
frothing at the mouth
in a minute.

255
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,422
- Retard rabies, yeah.

256
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,506
- Shut up, you bell ends.

257
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:00,675
- He's got retard rabies.

258
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,343
- Oh, yeah, whatever.

259
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:03,511
Dickheads. Chip.

260
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:04,512
- Tramp!

261
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:06,888
Little scruff.

262
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,058
- Where'd you get
your jacket from?

263
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:42,962
About time.
What you been doing?

264
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:44,589
- What have you been doing?

265
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,923
- Just been climbing that,
waiting for you.

266
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,508
- Trying to look through
me bedroom window?

267
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,676
- Oh, yeah.

268
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:50,886
Come on.

269
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:53,930
- Back in your bush.

270
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,275
- Go on.

271
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:09,736
Come on, Diesel.

272
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:11,029
- Hey, look, it's Kitten.

273
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,989
Go on!

274
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,324
- Come on.

275
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:17,576
- Go on.

276
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,078
Go on.
- No, come on.

277
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:20,078
- Go on, Diesel.

278
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,413
Go on.

279
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:23,414
- Yeah, Kitten.

280
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:24,707
You want some more
of that cable?

281
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:25,666
- I'm busy.

282
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,001
You can handle him better
than that.

283
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,335
What are you doing?

284
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:29,836
- He's holding his reins
too tight.

285
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:30,921
- What?

286
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:32,380
- He's holding his reins
too tight.

287
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,799
He's pulling it back.

288
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,342
- Loosen reins.

289
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,305
Where'd you learn that?

290
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:44,808
- Taken to road races
when I were younger.

291
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:46,810
- He's mad for horses,
him, you know.

292
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:47,977
- Come on.

293
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,187
- Oy, wait here.

294
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,815
- Go on, off you go.

295
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:55,359
That's better.

296
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,403
Why didn't you do that
first time?

297
00:16:57,403 --> 00:16:58,362
Go on.

298
00:16:58,404 --> 00:16:59,571
- Go on again.

299
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,671
- Face forward and get on
with your work, mate.

300
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:20,005
- I can't be arsed
doing my work.

301
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:21,215
- Well,
that's your first warning.

302
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,008
Get another one,
I'll see you again tomorrow.

303
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,385
- Oy, faggot!

304
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:26,720
Did your mum get fucked
by a horse, Swifty?

305
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:28,096
Is that what's got
bothering you?

306
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:30,473
- You're a fucking tramp.

307
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:31,808
- Don't drink that, mate.

308
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,892
Seen the state of his lips?

309
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,059
You'll have something on that.

310
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,102
- Your mum's a mong.

311
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:36,729
- Your dad, yeah,
is an inbred retard.

312
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,897
Look at me.
Is an inbred retard, yeah?

313
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:40,232
And your family's gonna be
in debt

314
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:42,483
for the rest
of their fucking lives.

315
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,026
- Oy, his psycho mate's coming.

316
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,905
- Go on, Swifty, hit him!

317
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,907
Go on, Swifty!
Don't let 'em bully you!

318
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,242
Fucking hit him!

319
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,370
- Fight! Fight! Fight!

320
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:58,165
Fight! Fight! Fight!

321
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,834
- Fuck off me!

322
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:04,003
- Fenton, Swift,
Headmaster's office now.

323
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:05,087
- Fuck off.

324
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:06,589
- Oh, yeah, big boy.

325
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,672
Go on.
- Dickhead.

326
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:09,257
- Go on!

327
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,134
- His team leader
administered his medication.

328
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,635
- Why do you use
this stupid language?

329
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:13,762
To make me feel intimidated?

330
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,804
Well, I'll tell you something.
I don't feel intimidated by you.

331
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,181
I've had two kids
through this school,

332
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,682
and you've failed both of 'em.

333
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,517
- You have to look at
the bigger picture.

334
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,685
- Where's he gonna go now

335
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,020
now you've kicked him out?

336
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:24,520
'Cause nobody else
is gonna take him, are they?

337
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,522
- Mrs. Fenton, if we both speak
at the same time,

338
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,524
neither of us will hear
what each other is saying.

339
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,776
- Well, I've heard enough
from you.

340
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,277
- I don't think
mainstream school's

341
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,945
the right place for him.

342
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,322
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,283
Is there anything I can-
- No.

344
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,995
You've been excluded
permanently.

345
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:44,288
- Sick.

346
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,790
- Arbor!

347
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:47,625
- He's been excluded
for 10 days.

348
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,958
Lad's got concussion.

349
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,126
He had to go to hospital.

350
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:51,628
That's what he said.

351
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:54,422
You need to get an education.

352
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:56,590
- It's all right, Mum.

353
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:58,425
- Our Arbor were protecting him.

354
00:18:58,467 --> 00:18:59,927
Arbor stood up for him.

355
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:05,056
- Didn't mean for him
to get into trouble, Mrs. Swift.

356
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:06,766
- I'm sorry, love.

357
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:12,230
- Brilliant, eh?

358
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:13,897
Don't have to go to school.

359
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:16,233
I can go out scrapping
and make some money.

360
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:17,901
You coming or what?

361
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,090
Guess what.

362
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,472
- Are you joking?
- No.

363
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:53,141
- We're like fucking right divs
with that.

364
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:54,850
- We got to start somewhere.

365
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:55,851
Come on.

366
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:57,144
- Oh, my God.

367
00:19:58,311 --> 00:19:59,479
- Come on, then.

368
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,570
- Smell you from round
the corner, Swifty.

369
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:08,696
- Go fuck off, you.

370
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,072
- Fucking stink, you.

371
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,574
- Oh, there's a pan there.

372
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:13,700
Watch that lot

373
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:15,285
so it don't get nicked.

374
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:20,289
- Oy, Swift.

375
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,332
Did you lose that baby
or did your dad sell it?

376
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:32,341
- They'll be worth something,
won't they, Swifty?

377
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:33,426
- Take that.

378
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:34,427
- Yeah.

379
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:35,427
- Leave these.

380
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:36,428
- Yeah, yeah, ain't it.

381
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,013
- Take these bits as well.

382
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:40,599
- Oy, what the fuck
are you doing?

383
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,434
- What does it look like?
We're scrapping 'em.

384
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,851
- You're fucking not
scrapping 'em.

385
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,853
I'm fixing 'em up
and selling 'em.

386
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:47,688
- Seriously,
you're fixing them up?

387
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,523
Don't fucking think so.

388
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:52,025
- Who the fucking hell
do you think you are, eh?

389
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,694
Coming round here
and thieving my fucking stuff.

390
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,197
- Get away. He's me mate.
- Hey!

391
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,407
Now fuck off out me sight,
the pair of you.

392
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:00,449
- Shut the fuck up.

393
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:03,452
- Go on and take your fucking
shitty pram with you.

394
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:05,662
You fucking get in now.

395
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,086
- Fenton, you thieving bastard!

396
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:14,420
I'll break your fucking legs!

397
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:15,755
It's your brother. Look.

398
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:28,808
- We look like fucking
smackheads.

399
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:29,809
- Oh, well.

400
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,352
- We look stupid, Arbor.

401
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:34,396
- Doesn't matter
if we look stupid,

402
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:35,563
does it, though?

403
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:37,232
We're not stupid.

404
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:38,900
Just going out
to earn a bit of money.

405
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:39,901
Know what I mean?

406
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:44,571
Got about 3 quid there
or summat.

407
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,200
We'll bang halves.

408
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,792
That's sick, mate.

409
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,507
- Look at that.

410
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,508
- That is massive.

411
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,843
Bradford massive.

412
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:11,137
Bradford massive.

413
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:12,179
Wicked, wicked.

414
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:16,182
- Fuck me!

415
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:21,396
Hey, come on.
Hurry up.

416
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:26,692
What?

417
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:28,027
- What's this crap?

418
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:31,279
- Aluminum, that.

419
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,032
Hang on.

420
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:35,700
And a bit of brass.

421
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:37,201
- Right, dump that over there

422
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:38,994
and help them lads get
bright wire out of that lot.

423
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:40,037
- All right.

424
00:22:40,078 --> 00:22:41,413
- Steve.

425
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:49,628
- Swifty, get wire out of that.

426
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:56,676
- Hey, what time
do you call this?

427
00:22:56,718 --> 00:22:59,304
You got to be back by 5:00
for weigh-in.

428
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:00,847
Hey, what's with the face?

429
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,974
Do you want to go round
with a pram like them two divs?

430
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,977
25 quid to hire
the horse and cart.

431
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,312
- I thought it were 20.
- Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

432
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,355
Price of copper's gone up.

433
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:10,481
My price has gone up too.

434
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,732
- Tight bastard.

435
00:23:11,774 --> 00:23:14,192
- What did you say?

436
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:15,526
Pay up or fuck off!

437
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,197
If you haven't got the money,
you can't take him out.

438
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:21,239
Simple.

439
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:23,325
Now turn round
and see to fucking Diesel.

440
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:30,915
What are you looking at?

441
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:33,209
Get on with what
I asked you to do!

442
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,252
- You lads working for Telecom?

443
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:36,337
Thought you worked for Railway.

444
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,672
- Right, what you got for me,
lads?

445
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:40,507
- We got bright wire,

446
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:41,966
legacy cables,

447
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:44,135
unmarked, untraceable.

448
00:23:44,177 --> 00:23:45,302
- Poly-sheathed cable.

449
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:46,470
- Processed?
- Aye.

450
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:48,138
And 40 of these.

451
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,473
10 kilo copper bales.

452
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:50,474
- What are you giving?

453
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:51,642
- I reckon 21/2 grand,
tops.

454
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:52,810
- Fuck off. 31/2.

455
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:53,976
- 21/2 grand.
- 31/2.

456
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:55,311
- If you took it in
and weighed it for 3,

457
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:56,312
it'd be no less.

458
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:57,313
Weigh it in then.

459
00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:58,439
- Fuck weighing it in.

460
00:23:58,481 --> 00:23:59,440
- Hey, you two.

461
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:01,608
Get that barrow
and bring it over here.

462
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,276
21/2 grand.

463
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,444
- And put fucking kettle on.

464
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,445
31/2.

465
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,446
- Fucking hell, Swifty.

466
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,365
- Come on.
Bring that barrow over.

467
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:20,333
- Ay, don't forget
your fucking pan, kid.

468
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,668
- 49 armored.

469
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,836
Add it all up.

470
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:24,004
Take it to the back.

471
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,922
Give us your pan.

472
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:28,757
One of ali.

473
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,301
- And one of brass.

474
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:32,469
- Aye, he's a good trotter.

475
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:33,679
- The best.

476
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:35,930
- Yeah, well, everyone you ask
got best, haven't they?

477
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:37,974
I've had a lad training Diesel.

478
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:39,517
He's fast, very fast.

479
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,269
£5.

480
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,311
That's for you.

481
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:43,478
- Ta.

482
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,607
- Hey.
And that's for you.

483
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,984
- Ta.

484
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:50,652
- Hiya, Mick.

485
00:24:50,694 --> 00:24:51,986
You all right, lads?

486
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:54,155
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, darling.

487
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:56,282
£2,960.

488
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:57,908
That's one...

489
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:01,328
Two...

490
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:02,454
£2,960.

491
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:03,371
All right?

492
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:05,373
- Hey, ya.

493
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:07,000
How you lend a horse and cart
for me and Swifty

494
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:08,709
and we'll bring you back
some proper scrap?

495
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:10,044
- You've no experience.
Fuck off.

496
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:11,211
- Hang on. Hang on.

497
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:12,921
His granddad used
to be a rag-and-bone man.

498
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:14,131
- You should be at school.

499
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:15,132
- I hate school.

500
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:16,632
I'm a fucking scrap man, me.

501
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:18,634
- Nah, nah, nah,
listen to this, mate.

502
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:20,136
He's a proper grafter,
this one.

503
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:21,220
- Does he ever shut up?

504
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:23,473
- Are you up for it, then,
Kitten?

505
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:26,099
Chip 'n' Pin v. Diesel.
Sunday, A-65.

506
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:27,142
- Course.

507
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,310
- Let's have a look at him,
then.

508
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:29,311
- Who?

509
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:30,687
- Shergar.
Who do you fucking think?

510
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:32,480
Diesel. Come on.

511
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:33,814
- All right.

512
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:35,316
- See you later.

513
00:25:41,154 --> 00:25:42,322
- Come on.

514
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:45,450
Here he is.

515
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:51,288
- Whoa, here we go.

516
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,584
- Hey, hey. Hey. hey.

517
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:57,502
What are you doing,
you bloody idiot?

518
00:25:57,543 --> 00:25:59,504
Come here.

519
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:01,214
Come here! Come here!

520
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,054
- Steady.
Steady. Steady. Steady.

521
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:10,555
Steady, lad.

522
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:12,557
Steady, lad.
Steady.

523
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:13,557
- Good lad.

524
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:14,684
- Steady.

525
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:16,852
- He's fast.
He's fast, you know.

526
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:18,980
- Going backwards.
- Oh, fuck off.

527
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:21,148
- Or with a rocket up its arse.

528
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,358
- What the fucking hell
were you doing, doing that?

529
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,240
Come on, Daniel.

530
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:19,241
Come round here, now.

531
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:20,241
Daniel. Daniel.

532
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:21,743
- Are you nervous?

533
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:24,037
You're sucking on that fag
well enough, aren't you?

534
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,539
Do you think you're up
to driving this horse or what?

535
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,373
Because if I don't think
you are,

536
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,042
I'm gonna have
another few quid on...

537
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:37,089
- I don't think he's gonna win.

538
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:38,591
- All right, do you not?
- Nah.

539
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:40,384
- 50 quid on Diesel.

540
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,053
50 fucking quid.

541
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,220
- Anybody else want a bet
or what?

542
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,478
- Hey, Kitten,
he's shit himself.

543
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,812
- Finish line, this.
- Yeah!

544
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:55,814
- They go under here full go.

545
00:27:55,856 --> 00:27:56,857
It's sick!

546
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:57,900
- Yeah!

547
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:09,534
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

548
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,918
- If Diesel wins,
Kitten'll be loaded.

549
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:21,963
- Come on!

550
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:26,091
- Get your money ready, Kitten!

551
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:27,384
- Go on! Go on!

552
00:28:27,425 --> 00:28:28,385
- Come on!

553
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:29,719
- Go on, Diesel!

554
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:36,850
- Go on, lad!

555
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,227
Go on!

556
00:28:39,478 --> 00:28:40,938
Go on, Diesel.
Good lad!

557
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,564
- Come on, Diesel!

558
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:44,691
Go on!

559
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,029
- Diesel's in the lead!

560
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:50,946
- Go on!

561
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:52,698
- Go on, Diesel.

562
00:28:52,739 --> 00:28:54,825
Go on, lad.

563
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,827
- Come on, Daniel!
Get up there!

564
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:04,166
Get back, you!

565
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,501
- Fuck off, man!

566
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,793
What are you doing?
- Keep up, Daniel.

567
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:08,795
He can't see the car!

568
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:10,338
He's got his blinders on!

569
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,007
- Get off me, man!
Fucking hell.

570
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:13,800
- Daniel, get up there!

571
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:15,342
- You're spooking him!

572
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,387
He's gonna get him hurt.

573
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:19,805
- Come on!

574
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:22,850
Get back, you fucking asshole!

575
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,183
- Stop pulling him back!

576
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:25,518
Give him his head.

577
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,519
Send him!

578
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:28,688
- Fucking hell, you!

579
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,897
Get back!

580
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:32,607
- Go on! Keep going!

581
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:34,443
You can do it!
Go on!

582
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:36,820
- Get up there!
Come on!

583
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:38,655
Come on!
- Yeah!

584
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:43,701
- Fucking bastard!

585
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,460
- Fuck! Fuck!

586
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,629
Fuck!

587
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:57,588
- What?

588
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,756
What? What?

589
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:13,727
- What the fuck
were you playing at?

590
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:14,728
- Weren't my fault.

591
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,729
A car got too close.

592
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:16,897
- I'll have your balls off.

593
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:18,231
- It's that horse.
It's spooked.

594
00:30:18,231 --> 00:30:20,567
- Don't blame it
on my fucking horse!

595
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:22,568
- It's mental out there.
- Out of my sight.

596
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:24,362
- They're all laughing at you
behind your back.

597
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:25,863
Laughing at you playing
a hard man,

598
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:27,365
when all you are is
a fucking wannabe Gypsy.

599
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:28,699
- All right, all right,
all right, all right.

600
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:30,241
Come on. Calm down.

601
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:35,997
Don't let me ever see you again
or I'll fucking kill you!

602
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:40,542
- We'll work for you.

603
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:44,797
- Get my horse in that box.

604
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:50,218
- Let me drive him for you.

605
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,345
- Swifty,
we're gonna be scrap men, us.

606
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,436
- Ain't got no money.

607
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:03,646
- Well, if you haven't got
the money,

608
00:31:03,688 --> 00:31:05,481
we have to take the settee,
love.

609
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:07,900
- Ain't got settee, neither.

610
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:09,610
- Well, where the fuck is it,
love?

611
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:14,990
- Where's this come from?

612
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:20,286
You've been grafting, ain't you?

613
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:23,038
I want better for you.

614
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:25,332
If you're to get on,
you've got to go to school.

615
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:26,667
- I'm excluded.

616
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:28,293
I'm not supposed
to go to school.

617
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:32,297
- You're breaking me heart,
love.

618
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:35,340
If you show 'em you're sorry,
they'll let you back in.

619
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,969
- How much did you get
for that scrap?

620
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:39,970
- Nowt.

621
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:41,430
- You must have got something
for it,

622
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:42,764
you lying bastard!

623
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,394
Fucking lying little bastard.

624
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:18,879
- Is he coming out?

625
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,213
- He's not here.

626
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:21,506
He's at school.

627
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,674
- School?

628
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:24,176
- He's better off there

629
00:32:24,217 --> 00:32:26,552
than hanging round here
with you.

630
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,224
- I stuck up for him, though.

631
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,935
Stuck up for lot of you
when people were ripping you.

632
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:48,155
- What's he still doing here?

633
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:51,032
- He's been excluded,
but he comes anyway.

634
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:02,387
- All right, Cheech?
Where's Chong?

635
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,096
- Leave him alone.
Come here.

636
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,435
What are these?

637
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:10,936
- Oh, from yesterday.

638
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:12,770
You weren't here
and some good stuff came in.

639
00:34:12,812 --> 00:34:14,480
- Yeah, well, it's still got
to be accounted for.

640
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:15,607
You know,
we've got to be careful.

641
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:16,733
The laws are tightening up.

642
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,109
- Should be out there
watching ports,

643
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:19,736
not wasting time on us.

644
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:20,902
What's that?

645
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:23,405
- Can I finish yoking up Tommy
and go out scrapping for you?

646
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,240
- Sod off.

647
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:28,868
Come on, give me a chance.

648
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,537
- Stop mithering us.
I said no.

649
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:34,206
- Then Tommy'll just sit there
all day.

650
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,375
I've seen a batch of cable.
I could get it for you.

651
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,084
- Keep it above board, love.

652
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:40,503
- Have to be processed.

653
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,340
You got 25 quid?

654
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,507
- I got 20.

655
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,725
- Would you like one, love?

656
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,991
Oh, no, not him.

657
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:22,916
Stop.

658
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,210
- You've been excluded, Fenton.

659
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:26,085
- Easy now.

660
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,419
- I'm calling security.

661
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:30,422
What are you doing sat here,
you daft twat?

662
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:31,757
Let's get out
and make some money.

663
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,592
Come on.

664
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,677
- You got that bridle too tight
on that horse.

665
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,891
- Let me come sort it out
for you.

666
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,225
- You're a bad influence,
Fenton!

667
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,226
- Go, go, go.

668
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,561
- Go, go, go.
Go! Go!

669
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,773
Giddyap, Tommy!

670
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,237
- I know where
we can get some cable.

671
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,239
Make this horse go faster,
will you, yeah?

672
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,781
- Yah!

673
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,034
- Put your backs into it.

674
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:05,996
- Thanks.
- There you go.

675
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:07,371
- Good work, boys.

676
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:09,999
- Pry that motor out now, then.

677
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,333
- All right, then.

678
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:15,837
There. It's out.

679
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:19,591
Worth quite a bit.

680
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:21,467
Copper wound, that.

681
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:51,201
Hey, come on, hurry up.

682
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,578
They haven't seen you.

683
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,539
Let's smash this on the cart.

684
00:37:20,186 --> 00:37:23,313
Got to burn it off, ain't we,
'cause it's marked.

685
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:25,023
- Sound like Kitten, you.

686
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,376
- Piece of cable like that,

687
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,211
length and width of your arm,

688
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:51,713
probably about 500 quid.

689
00:37:51,755 --> 00:37:53,548
- Don't even think about it,
Arbor.

690
00:38:07,936 --> 00:38:09,271
- Steady.

691
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,481
- All right, lads,
where's your pushchair?

692
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,524
- Fuck off.

693
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,150
- Much better load
than you had last time.

694
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,986
- Good scrap, this.
200 pound a ton.

695
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:18,070
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

696
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,113
- We'll have a look.

697
00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:20,947
- I know.
- All right.

698
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,448
It's better than last load
anyway.

699
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,741
Do you just want to take it
round there?

700
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:49,139
- Here are.

701
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,307
We burnt all casing off

702
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:52,183
and removed all SmartWater dye.

703
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:58,856
- 37 on that?

704
00:38:58,898 --> 00:38:59,899
- Yeah.

705
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,076
- All right, Arbor love?

706
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:14,077
- Yeah.

707
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,954
- 240 quid.

708
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:18,289
That's all right,
ain't it?

709
00:39:18,331 --> 00:39:19,874
- Gonna go check on this horse.

710
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:20,875
- Yeah, whatever.

711
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,544
- 2, 3, 4, 5...

712
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:26,296
There you go.
- Ta.

713
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:27,297
- Hey, do you want your docket?

714
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:28,465
- Yeah, please.

715
00:39:28,506 --> 00:39:29,466
- There you go.

716
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:30,675
- Thanks.

717
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,303
- Hey.

718
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:34,803
- What are you doing?
Get off.

719
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:36,305
- For tax.
You're under 16.

720
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:37,306
Got to tax you at source.

721
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:38,807
- Idiot.

722
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,684
- What you doing?

723
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:43,019
- Swifty!

724
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:44,520
110 quid there.

725
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:46,022
That'll sort
your mum's electric.

726
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:47,023
Buzzing.

727
00:39:47,023 --> 00:39:48,024
- Sick, eh?

728
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:49,567
What are you gonna
spend yours on, then?

729
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:50,943
Buy a new settee and that?

730
00:39:50,984 --> 00:39:52,653
Yeah.

731
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,782
- Here are, though, Swifty,
yeah?

732
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,616
Just don't let your dad
get his hands on it.

733
00:39:58,658 --> 00:39:59,867
- No, I won't.

734
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,063
Oy.

735
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,399
- Hurry up, Swifty.
I want to get off.

736
00:40:38,026 --> 00:40:40,361
Reckon we could get
that cable off that pylon?

737
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:41,863
- It's too risky.

738
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:45,658
- Think of money, though,
Swifty.

739
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,659
Oh, come on, man.

740
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:47,826
I can't do it on me own.

741
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:48,952
- Oy! Swifty.

742
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:50,328
- All right, Kitten?

743
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:53,331
- Meet me first thing, 6:00 a. m.

744
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:55,834
I want you to have a go
at driving Diesel on road.

745
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:57,293
See what you can do.

746
00:40:57,293 --> 00:40:58,544
All right?

747
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:04,924
Get in.

748
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:06,759
- What's the point
in a trotting horse?

749
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:08,553
They can't pull a cart.

750
00:42:04,143 --> 00:42:05,770
- It's well soft, this one.

751
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:07,605
- What? Shut up, Swifty.

752
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:10,440
You're soft, you daft bastard.

753
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:12,275
- Give us a footie on.

754
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:15,111
- God's sake.

755
00:42:15,153 --> 00:42:16,947
You better not have shit
on your shoe.

756
00:42:16,988 --> 00:42:18,614
Oh, your arse is on me head.

757
00:42:18,656 --> 00:42:20,115
- Hurry up and stop
mucking about.

758
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:21,116
- Get off!

759
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,326
There, you're on now.

760
00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:23,494
Right.

761
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:28,081
What the fuck's happening here,
then?

762
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:29,582
There you are.

763
00:42:29,624 --> 00:42:31,084
- It's like a fucking advert,
isn't it, eh?

764
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,919
- Summat worth nicking here.

765
00:42:34,962 --> 00:42:36,755
That your new dosser, Kitten?

766
00:42:36,797 --> 00:42:37,965
- What, are you gonna get him
to finish

767
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:39,758
that job Daniel couldn't do, eh?

768
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,094
- He'll not be able
to shift it either.

769
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:45,555
Lad told me cable chamber
is still isolated.

770
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,015
At least 4 grand of copper
down there.

771
00:42:50,393 --> 00:42:51,685
- Make yourself useful.

772
00:42:51,726 --> 00:42:53,562
Get cable and put it in fire.

773
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:58,400
Risk to reward ratio's
in our favor then.

774
00:42:58,441 --> 00:42:59,900
- Not on that job it ain't.

775
00:42:59,942 --> 00:43:02,862
What? 132,000 volts?

776
00:43:02,903 --> 00:43:04,697
You'd have to be mad
or desperate or stupid

777
00:43:04,738 --> 00:43:06,532
or summat to risk that.

778
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:48,819
- Where you off?

779
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:51,321
You're never up this early
to go scrapping.

780
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,489
- No, I'm off to drive
Kitten's horse

781
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:54,490
this morning, aren't I?

782
00:43:54,574 --> 00:43:55,700
- What for?

783
00:43:55,742 --> 00:43:57,701
- Arbor!
Where's your kiddie coke?

784
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,328
Where's your fucking pills?
- Oh, shit. What's he doing?

785
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:00,370
- Get the fuck off!

786
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,371
- Where's your money?
You got money?

787
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,456
Give me your fucking money!

788
00:44:02,497 --> 00:44:03,624
- Get the fuck off him!

789
00:44:03,665 --> 00:44:04,625
- Give me!

790
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:06,626
Get off!
Get the fuck off me, Swifty!

791
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:07,960
Please, mate, please!

792
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:09,337
They're gonna do me
if I don't pay 'em back.

793
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:10,505
- I hate you.

794
00:44:10,546 --> 00:44:11,839
I hate you!

795
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:14,508
Fucking prick!

796
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:16,551
- Fuck off, then!

797
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:30,522
- Who invited you?

798
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:32,482
- Are you gonna let Swifty drive
in the race for you?

799
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:35,401
Well, are you?

800
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:39,363
How do you make money
from a race?

801
00:44:42,741 --> 00:44:46,203
How much is Diesel worth,
then, eh?

802
00:44:46,245 --> 00:44:49,205
1 OK?
20K?

803
00:44:49,247 --> 00:44:52,542
If he wins in race,
he increases in value.

804
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,877
Bet you could sell Diesel
for thousands, isn't it?

805
00:44:54,919 --> 00:44:56,753
- Shut the fuck up.

806
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:10,766
He's good.
He's focused.

807
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,016
- I could do that.

808
00:45:12,058 --> 00:45:13,560
- Oh, could you, heck?

809
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:24,069
Takes skill, that.

810
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:30,533
- Whoa, boy.
- Whoa, whoa.

811
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:31,701
- You done good, Swifty.

812
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:33,035
You done good.

813
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:35,872
Handled him well.

814
00:45:35,872 --> 00:45:36,872
- Can't half boogie, can he?

815
00:45:36,872 --> 00:45:37,873
- Aye, he can boogie.

816
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:38,999
You had a good feel for him.

817
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,333
- Yeah, I thought it
were gonna be a bit hard,

818
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,377
but it came back quite nicely.

819
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,838
- Hey, Diesel, good lad.

820
00:45:47,006 --> 00:45:48,632
- Give us a bit of this.

821
00:45:48,674 --> 00:45:50,634
Well, open it, then!

822
00:45:50,676 --> 00:45:53,052
- Hey, what are you, his dosser?

823
00:45:53,094 --> 00:45:54,512
You shouldn't be drinking that
shite anyway.

824
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:55,847
You're hyper enough as it is.

825
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:56,931
You need tranquilizers.

826
00:45:56,973 --> 00:45:58,933
Bugger off.

827
00:45:58,975 --> 00:46:00,185
How were his mouth?
All right?

828
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:01,935
- Yeah, thought it was gonna be
a bit hard,

829
00:46:01,977 --> 00:46:03,478
but he's easily pulled back,
isn't he?

830
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,479
- Aye.

831
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:06,148
His girth all right,
not too tight?

832
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,232
- Yeah, he can breathe.

833
00:46:08,275 --> 00:46:10,026
- Hey! Where are you going?
Where the fuck are you going?

834
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,694
Come back here now!

835
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,696
Fucking get down there!

836
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,198
Come back!

837
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:21,578
- Steady.
- Arbor!

838
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:24,539
Whoa, Diesel, whoa.

839
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,540
Steady, lad.

840
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:30,169
- Stay away from my horse!

841
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,881
Turn him round.

842
00:46:38,384 --> 00:46:40,386
15 grand's worth of horse.

843
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:44,097
Fucking idiot.

844
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,416
- Fuck!

845
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:21,548
- Yah!

846
00:47:32,431 --> 00:47:33,474
- Mum?

847
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,476
- They were looking for Martin

848
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:37,687
'cause he's been
nicking off people.

849
00:47:40,022 --> 00:47:42,649
- Every time I try to get us
out of trouble,

850
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:44,693
he just gets us deeper in it.

851
00:47:46,945 --> 00:47:48,280
Where is he?

852
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,572
- Laying low.

853
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:51,282
His dad's, I think.

854
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:58,746
- I'll sort it, Mum.

855
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:00,582
- How can you sort it, love?

856
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:02,917
- Make some money.
Pay off his debts.

857
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:04,877
- No, Arbor, you're a kid.

858
00:48:08,755 --> 00:48:10,257
- Come here, Mum.

859
00:48:47,414 --> 00:48:49,041
- Bastards.

860
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:51,043
I'm having that.

861
00:48:54,587 --> 00:48:57,048
Ah, just got electric shock.

862
00:48:57,048 --> 00:48:58,549
I'll bench you above me head.

863
00:49:03,053 --> 00:49:04,179
- Ah!

864
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:05,472
- Watch yourself.

865
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:07,933
Whoa, watch it.
You nearly took me arm off.

866
00:49:07,974 --> 00:49:09,100
Don't mess about there now.

867
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:10,185
- I'm not messing about.

868
00:49:10,227 --> 00:49:12,186
- Go to sleep.

869
00:49:12,228 --> 00:49:13,354
- No way.

870
00:49:13,395 --> 00:49:15,231
Get away.

871
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,900
Not hard enough, mate.

872
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:18,901
- Yeah, I am.

873
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:20,068
- You're not.
- Come here.

874
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:21,069
- Don't-

875
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,570
- Give you a little dig with it.

876
00:49:22,612 --> 00:49:23,571
- You wouldn't dare.

877
00:49:23,655 --> 00:49:24,948
Let me give you a little dig
with it.

878
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:26,574
- No.
- Here are, then.

879
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:27,741
Just in your arm.

880
00:49:27,783 --> 00:49:29,409
- No.
- Don't be tight.

881
00:49:29,451 --> 00:49:30,452
- Don't be tight?

882
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:31,703
Let me give you a dig
in the head.

883
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:32,746
- Give me a dig in arm

884
00:49:32,788 --> 00:49:35,082
if I can give you a dig in arm
with it.

885
00:49:35,123 --> 00:49:36,582
- No, 'cause your digs-Ah!

886
00:49:36,624 --> 00:49:38,584
You're crushing my foot!

887
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:40,419
- Don't try and test me.

888
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:41,462
You can't test me.

889
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:42,880
- Stop squashing me foot, then.

890
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:46,758
Mum, bizzies.

891
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,594
- Fuck's sake.

892
00:49:49,636 --> 00:49:51,263
I'm sick of lying for him.

893
00:49:51,304 --> 00:49:53,430
They'll raid his dad's flat.

894
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:55,057
He'll kick him out.
He'll come back here.

895
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:57,059
And I'll get me windows
put through again.

896
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:58,394
I've had enough now.

897
00:49:58,435 --> 00:50:00,562
Maybe a spell in jail
will do him good,

898
00:50:00,603 --> 00:50:01,563
sort him out.

899
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,356
He can detox and all.

900
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:04,524
- Can still get it inside, Mum.

901
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:05,608
- How do you know that?

902
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,944
- Everyone knows that.

903
00:50:07,986 --> 00:50:09,778
- He ain't here.
I've kicked him out.

904
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,446
And don't ask me where he is,
'cause I don't know.

905
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:12,948
- We've come about Arbor Fenton.

906
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,075
- I don't think so.

907
00:50:15,117 --> 00:50:16,951
- Heard he had a bit of trouble.

908
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:18,786
- It's all sorted now, thanks.

909
00:50:20,913 --> 00:50:24,083
- You should take
your shoes off.

910
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:26,209
Shoes off.

911
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:38,220
- This is a formal interview
under caution.

912
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,513
Do you understand that, Fenton?

913
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:42,515
Hey, do you understand?

914
00:50:42,557 --> 00:50:43,850
- Yeah.

915
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:45,852
- A witness saw two youths

916
00:50:45,894 --> 00:50:48,188
burning railway
or communications cable.

917
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:50,022
- That's nowt to do with him.

918
00:50:50,063 --> 00:50:53,400
- Cable theft is a very serious
crime, Mrs. Fenton.

919
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:55,819
Trespass on the railway
is £1,000 fine.

920
00:50:55,861 --> 00:50:57,654
- I ain't been on railway.

921
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:58,821
- Vandalism.

922
00:50:58,863 --> 00:51:00,156
Endangering lives.

923
00:51:00,198 --> 00:51:02,158
Maximum penalty
of life imprisonment.

924
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,201
- He's just a kid.

925
00:51:03,242 --> 00:51:04,952
He ain't nicked no cable.

926
00:51:04,952 --> 00:51:06,369
You're looking at wrong place.

927
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:08,413
- He is, as you say,
Mrs. Fenton, a minor.

928
00:51:08,455 --> 00:51:10,582
There's unscrupulous people
out there getting kids

929
00:51:10,624 --> 00:51:11,917
to do their dirty work

930
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,752
so they don't get into trouble
with the police themselves.

931
00:51:14,794 --> 00:51:16,253
- I do look out for him.

932
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:23,384
- Is that it?

933
00:51:23,426 --> 00:51:25,845
Go on, then.
You can put your shoes back on.

934
00:51:30,058 --> 00:51:31,350
- See ya.

935
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:32,684
- Bye.

936
00:51:39,524 --> 00:51:41,984
- You heard what
that policewoman said.

937
00:51:42,026 --> 00:51:43,820
That Kitten is using you.

938
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,446
I don't want you
going down there no more.

939
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:47,323
- Mum, I'm gonna make
a lot of money.

940
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:49,825
- I said I don't want you
going down there no more.

941
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:52,202
- For God's sake.

942
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,707
- Don't do that.

943
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:02,086
Can't you see it's pulling
on the corner of his mouth?

944
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:03,379
How would you like it
if someone did it to you?

945
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,379
- Fuck off.

946
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,172
You think you know it all, you.

947
00:52:06,214 --> 00:52:08,091
- Hey, what are you doing here?

948
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,425
I told you,

949
00:52:09,467 --> 00:52:10,760
I don't trust him near Diesel.

950
00:52:10,802 --> 00:52:12,344
Now get back.
Stay back.

951
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:14,721
Have you yoked him?
- Yeah.

952
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:16,348
- Right, come on, then.
Bring him round.

953
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,648
It's all right.

954
00:52:28,817 --> 00:52:30,444
All right.

955
00:52:30,485 --> 00:52:32,028
You done?

956
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,071
- Yeah.
- Come here.

957
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:41,162
You all right?
- Yeah.

958
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:42,413
- I want you to drive him
in re-match

959
00:52:42,455 --> 00:52:43,414
against Micky's horse.

960
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,290
- Me?

961
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,291
- You can do that?

962
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:47,917
- Yeah.

963
00:52:47,959 --> 00:52:49,043
- It's a big race, Swifty.

964
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:50,086
Don't let me down.

965
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:53,131
Win and Diesel's worth
big bucks.

966
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:55,340
Lose and he's worth nowt.

967
00:52:57,426 --> 00:52:58,886
Get off my car.

968
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:01,846
- Get in.

969
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:04,849
- He'll just keep money
from race, you know.

970
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:07,059
How's that gonna get
your mum out of debt?

971
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,980
You're just lining his pockets,
you know, Swifty.

972
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,106
He's using you.

973
00:53:18,944 --> 00:53:20,905
We won't be able to move this.

974
00:53:20,946 --> 00:53:22,072
- Course we will.

975
00:53:22,114 --> 00:53:24,241
- Will we fuck, man?
Are you mad?

976
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:25,743
- Right, take some
of that stuff off,

977
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,077
and that, though, gut it out.

978
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:29,412
- These won't come off.

979
00:53:29,454 --> 00:53:30,497
- What won't, that?

980
00:53:30,538 --> 00:53:31,498
Go on, pull it.

981
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:32,665
Job's a good one.

982
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:35,501
See that? It'll be easy.

983
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:36,877
Go on. Get started.

984
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,800
Let's just keep stripping it,
and we'll be able to do it.

985
00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:45,968
- You don't even know
what you're doing.

986
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,303
- Course I do.

987
00:53:47,345 --> 00:53:49,305
- Daft cunt.

988
00:53:50,515 --> 00:53:53,809
Be able to get all roof off
and that at this rate.

989
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,393
- How are we gonna put that
on there?

990
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:58,063
- There's a way.
- Is there, fuck.

991
00:53:58,105 --> 00:53:59,231
- I got wheel off.

992
00:53:59,272 --> 00:54:01,732
- What you want me to do?
Shit Smarties?

993
00:54:01,774 --> 00:54:03,943
Fucking car!

994
00:54:07,821 --> 00:54:08,988
Pull it, girl.

995
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:13,952
Pull it. Pull it.

996
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:18,288
- Get yourself off the field.

997
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,790
You're gonna kill that pony,
lad.

998
00:54:19,832 --> 00:54:21,583
- Fuck off
and mind your own business.

999
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,217
- Hey, ya, I need some boys

1000
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:33,427
that'll be able to lift a car
on that cart.

1001
00:54:33,468 --> 00:54:34,761
I'll give yous a fiver.

1002
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:36,763
- I'll do it.

1003
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:38,432
But I want a tenner.

1004
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:41,058
- All right, all right, Kevin.
A tenner.

1005
00:54:42,643 --> 00:54:44,728
- I'll do it for a fiver.

1006
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,105
- You can hardly stand up, mate,

1007
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:48,107
let alone lift a fucking car.

1008
00:54:48,149 --> 00:54:49,441
- Yeah, go on.
I'll give you a lift.

1009
00:54:49,482 --> 00:54:50,442
- Go on, now, get out.

1010
00:54:50,483 --> 00:54:51,443
- Fuck off, you smackheads,

1011
00:54:51,484 --> 00:54:53,486
fore I wrap a pool cue
round your head.

1012
00:54:53,528 --> 00:54:55,655
Fucking twat.

1013
00:55:00,284 --> 00:55:01,577
- Well done, lads.

1014
00:55:01,618 --> 00:55:02,911
- Sorted.

1015
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:04,913
- Getting too old for this job,
me.

1016
00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:08,916
- Come on! Move over!

1017
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:11,252
- Fuck off, wankers!

1018
00:55:11,294 --> 00:55:13,129
- Move out the way, you pikeys!

1019
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:14,129
- Wankers!

1020
00:55:19,301 --> 00:55:20,802
- Put it by light iron!

1021
00:55:24,972 --> 00:55:27,767
- Sweet, Tommy.
Good boy.

1022
00:55:27,808 --> 00:55:29,894
- Where you going?
- Pay point.

1023
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:30,894
- You owe me 25 quid

1024
00:55:30,935 --> 00:55:31,978
for the hire
of the horse and cart.

1025
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,979
Value of burnt-out car?

1026
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:34,314
Fuck all.

1027
00:55:34,355 --> 00:55:36,524
Now get back out there
and earn it.

1028
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,235
- Robbing bastard.

1029
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:00,420
Fucking hurry up!

1030
00:56:00,462 --> 00:56:01,922
I want to get out of here!

1031
00:56:03,464 --> 00:56:05,424
He's a bastard, him.

1032
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:06,425
We don't need him.

1033
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:09,095
I'm gonna get that cable off
of pylon and all.

1034
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:11,596
Come on. Move.

1035
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,936
- Shouldn't we do this down
at Kitten's?

1036
00:56:17,936 --> 00:56:19,437
- Why am I gonna go down there?

1037
00:56:19,437 --> 00:56:21,063
He's a muppet.

1038
00:56:21,105 --> 00:56:23,065
What's the point?
We're here.

1039
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:26,527
- Where are you gonna get paid
up here?

1040
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:28,194
- Take 'em down to another
scrapyard.

1041
00:56:28,236 --> 00:56:30,071
Not going down
to Kitten's again.

1042
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,911
- Where the fuck have
you got all them from, Arbor?

1043
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:39,621
You've chorred 'em off, Kitten,
ain't you?

1044
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,289
Arbor, you're gonna get
your head kicked in.

1045
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,791
- 15 bales. 600 quid.

1046
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:43,792
- You've got to understand,

1047
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:44,959
I'm dying to run that race.

1048
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,960
- Yeah, and I know you are.

1049
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,795
I'm dying to get some money
for us both.

1050
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:48,963
Why's you a dosser?

1051
00:56:49,004 --> 00:56:49,922
If you don't stand up
for yourself, Swifty,

1052
00:56:49,964 --> 00:56:50,923
you'll never have owt.

1053
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:52,799
You'll always be a poor bastard
under someone else's thumb.

1054
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:54,300
- All you're bothered about
is metal.

1055
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,927
- All you're bothered about
is horses.

1056
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:57,595
You're soft.

1057
00:56:57,637 --> 00:56:59,639
You need to harden up.

1058
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:21,533
Oy, what's that?

1059
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:22,868
Side of that bin.

1060
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:24,202
- Whoa, steady, Tommy.

1061
00:57:40,175 --> 00:57:41,968
We'll go weigh in now, yeah?

1062
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:46,305
- Hang about, man.

1063
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:48,640
I want to do something first.

1064
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:49,725
Go on.

1065
00:57:57,815 --> 00:57:59,274
You think it's live?

1066
00:57:59,274 --> 00:58:01,109
- I don't know.
I wouldn't risk it.

1067
00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:16,372
Wha-what you doing?

1068
00:58:16,414 --> 00:58:18,374
You were gonna test it
on that foal, weren't you?

1069
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,210
- Get off.

1070
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:21,878
- You're a fucking psycho, you.

1071
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,879
- Get off!

1072
00:58:22,921 --> 00:58:24,546
- Have your drugs
stopped working?

1073
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,048
How would you like it?!

1074
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,382
- Swifty!

1075
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:31,095
Swifty! Get off!

1076
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:34,764
- Get off! Swifty!

1077
00:59:12,297 --> 00:59:13,631
- Here you are.

1078
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:18,814
- Hey, you can't bring
that horse in here.

1079
01:00:20,648 --> 01:00:22,150
- I've come all the way
from Bradford.

1080
01:00:22,192 --> 01:00:24,527
- Well, you're a daft bastard,
then, aren't you?

1081
01:00:24,569 --> 01:00:26,446
- What am I meant to do
with that lot, then?

1082
01:00:26,488 --> 01:00:27,780
- Go on, sling your hook.

1083
01:00:27,821 --> 01:00:28,822
Go on.

1084
01:00:30,574 --> 01:00:32,242
- Fucking dickhead.

1085
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:44,878
- What the fuck are you doing,
Arbor?

1086
01:00:44,878 --> 01:00:46,713
- Hey! Hey!

1087
01:00:49,174 --> 01:00:51,635
Isn't that Kitten's horse?

1088
01:00:51,676 --> 01:00:53,969
- He'll fucking mince you, mate.

1089
01:00:54,011 --> 01:00:55,137
- They won't let me
in scrapyard

1090
01:00:55,179 --> 01:00:56,180
with horse and cart.

1091
01:00:59,016 --> 01:01:00,308
We'll do you a favor, eh?

1092
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:02,977
We'll take scrap in van,
get it weighed in for you.

1093
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:04,979
We take a cut.

1094
01:01:04,979 --> 01:01:06,523
You get the rest.

1095
01:01:10,984 --> 01:01:11,944
- All right, then.

1096
01:01:11,985 --> 01:01:12,945
- Good lad. Come on.

1097
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:27,082
- You nicked this off of Kitten,
didn't you?

1098
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:29,126
This is the stuff I brought in.

1099
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:35,506
Ah, what do I care, eh?

1100
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:37,049
I got paid for it.

1101
01:01:37,049 --> 01:01:39,719
Take a cut now,
I get paid for it twice.

1102
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:19,045
That's for nicking
my railway cable,

1103
01:02:19,086 --> 01:02:20,546
thieving little twat.

1104
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:10,308
Fucking hate you, Arbor.

1105
01:05:00,478 --> 01:05:01,645
- Come here.

1106
01:05:03,314 --> 01:05:04,482
Come with me.

1107
01:05:12,655 --> 01:05:14,282
- You owe me 1 grand.

1108
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:15,450
- Mick took money.

1109
01:05:15,492 --> 01:05:16,658
- Too fucking bad.

1110
01:05:18,744 --> 01:05:22,623
Those bales were marked,
you stupid little twat!

1111
01:05:22,664 --> 01:05:24,624
Put it to widest setting,
Swifty.

1112
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:27,085
Get off!

1113
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:32,673
- Come here. Come here.

1114
01:05:32,714 --> 01:05:34,007
Give me your hand.
- Get off!

1115
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:35,050
- Come here!

1116
01:05:36,134 --> 01:05:37,928
- Get off!

1117
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:41,097
- I'm gonna take your hand off,
you thieving little bastard!

1118
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:42,765
Come here.
- Swifty!

1119
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:45,476
- Don't fuck me about!

1120
01:05:52,023 --> 01:05:54,859
- You're gonna replace
that copper you stole off me.

1121
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:01,031
Look for a concrete block
over a manhole.

1122
01:06:01,073 --> 01:06:02,908
That's cable chamber.

1123
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,160
Take chain off.

1124
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:09,664
Put them boots on.

1125
01:06:19,548 --> 01:06:20,841
Zips.

1126
01:06:20,882 --> 01:06:22,842
Take these off before you start.

1127
01:06:22,883 --> 01:06:23,884
Now go.

1128
01:06:45,529 --> 01:06:47,321
Fuck are you looking at?
Go and see to Diesel.

1129
01:06:49,115 --> 01:06:50,074
- Come on.

1130
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,756
Shit.

1131
01:07:30,735 --> 01:07:32,695
- I came for Tommy.

1132
01:07:32,737 --> 01:07:34,906
Make sure you were
treating him right.

1133
01:07:40,243 --> 01:07:41,370
You killed that foal.

1134
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:43,705
- I don't even know what
you're on about, Swifty.

1135
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:45,414
- You're a fucking mental case!
Course you did.

1136
01:07:45,456 --> 01:07:46,540
You're out of control.

1137
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:51,629
- Did you grass me up, though,
Swifty?

1138
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:53,505
- No, but I wished
I had've done.

1139
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:57,425
You fucked it all up, Arbor.

1140
01:07:59,552 --> 01:08:01,178
- Well, if you hate me so much,

1141
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,305
then how come
you've come back, huh?

1142
01:08:03,347 --> 01:08:06,308
- 'Cause I'm thick
like everyone says.

1143
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:08,018
I'm soft, aren't I?

1144
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,145
- Swifty, wait there.

1145
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:12,313
Listen.

1146
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:15,191
I swear down on my life
I did not do it.

1147
01:08:16,734 --> 01:08:18,360
I need your help, Swifty.

1148
01:08:18,402 --> 01:08:19,361
Please.

1149
01:08:32,623 --> 01:08:34,082
- Well, get behind it, then,

1150
01:08:34,124 --> 01:08:35,625
or we'll never shift it.

1151
01:08:40,088 --> 01:08:41,464
Giddyap.

1152
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:05,902
- Fucking hell.

1153
01:09:05,944 --> 01:09:08,279
- Oh, shit, Arbor.

1154
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:10,114
- I'm fucking shitting myself.

1155
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:33,468
- Fuck's sake, Arbor.

1156
01:09:33,509 --> 01:09:34,510
Move.

1157
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:37,430
- Here you are.
You need gloves.

1158
01:09:37,472 --> 01:09:38,765
Here you are.

1159
01:11:26,609 --> 01:11:27,735
Swifty?

1160
01:11:35,241 --> 01:11:36,409
Swifty!

1161
01:11:43,124 --> 01:11:44,291
Swifty!

1162
01:11:46,793 --> 01:11:48,003
Come on.

1163
01:12:06,144 --> 01:12:07,270
Swifty.

1164
01:12:53,978 --> 01:12:55,312
Steady.

1165
01:13:50,986 --> 01:13:53,447
- Fucking bastard!

1166
01:13:53,447 --> 01:13:55,448
Kill you!

1167
01:13:55,489 --> 01:13:57,116
- Get off him!

1168
01:13:57,158 --> 01:13:58,909
Fucking get off him!

1169
01:14:02,246 --> 01:14:05,749
Get off him!

1170
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:07,876
Get off him.

1171
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:08,918
- Let go of him!

1172
01:14:08,918 --> 01:14:10,378
- Fucking bastard!

1173
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,212
I'll fucking kill you!

1174
01:14:12,254 --> 01:14:13,881
You killed him!

1175
01:14:13,922 --> 01:14:15,049
- Grab his legs.

1176
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:16,884
- Ah! Get off!

1177
01:14:16,925 --> 01:14:18,552
Get off of me!

1178
01:14:21,346 --> 01:14:22,805
- You twats!

1179
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,476
- Get him in the cabin.

1180
01:14:35,108 --> 01:14:37,234
You bastard!

1181
01:14:56,043 --> 01:14:57,503
- Oh, no.

1182
01:15:16,019 --> 01:15:18,437
- Fucking bastard!

1183
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:19,939
- Calm down.
- Fuck off!

1184
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:21,691
Fucking hate you!

1185
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:24,944
- Don't say owt.
- Fuck off!

1186
01:15:26,152 --> 01:15:27,445
Fuck off!

1187
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:29,614
- I made him do it.

1188
01:15:29,656 --> 01:15:31,741
It were my fault the lad died.

1189
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,120
- Step down, mate.

1190
01:18:08,004 --> 01:18:10,172
- She doesn't want to see you.

1191
01:19:18,523 --> 01:19:19,691
Hey, it's me.

1192
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:22,789
- You all right, bro?

1193
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:27,501
You all right?

1194
01:20:35,008 --> 01:20:36,342
You gonna come out?

1195
01:20:39,178 --> 01:20:40,596
Arbor, come on.
I'll make you a brew.

1196
01:20:40,637 --> 01:20:41,722
We'll go and-

1197
01:20:41,763 --> 01:20:43,765
We'll go and have a kickabout
or something.

1198
01:20:45,142 --> 01:20:46,143
What you say?

1199
01:20:48,269 --> 01:20:49,437
Play a bit of footie?

1200
01:20:55,443 --> 01:20:56,568
Arbor, seriously, mate.

1201
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:58,403
Mum's really...

1202
01:20:58,445 --> 01:20:59,404
really worried.

1203
01:20:59,446 --> 01:21:00,405
Please come down.

1204
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:01,448
Please.

1205
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:05,743
Arbor, come on.
Stop being a dick.

1206
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:06,911
Please, mate.

1207
01:21:06,952 --> 01:21:09,246
Oy, look at me at least, bro.

1208
01:21:09,288 --> 01:21:10,289
Arbor.

1209
01:21:11,957 --> 01:21:12,916
Mate, please come out.

1210
01:21:12,957 --> 01:21:14,459
I don't want to drag you out.

1211
01:21:16,044 --> 01:21:17,003
Mate, come on.

1212
01:21:17,045 --> 01:21:18,004
Come on, bro.

1213
01:21:18,046 --> 01:21:19,005
Mate, don't, please.

1214
01:21:19,047 --> 01:21:20,006
Don't struggle,

1215
01:21:20,048 --> 01:21:21,089
'cause I'm gonna have
to drag you out of there.

1216
01:21:21,173 --> 01:21:22,633
Come on, please, get out.

1217
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:24,635
Arbor, come-

1218
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:25,928
Come the fuck out now.

1219
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:27,012
Get the-

1220
01:21:29,138 --> 01:21:30,264
Get out, Arbor!

1221
01:21:30,306 --> 01:21:31,390
Fucking hell!

1222
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:40,827
- I appreciate it, love.
