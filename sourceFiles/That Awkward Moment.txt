taking a shit in there?

179
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,079
Yep.
Jesus! Every time.

180
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,789
DANIEL: We're going the fuck out.
Is that ice cream?

181
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,290
You bought ice cream, Mikey?
Come on.

182
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:37,542
Yeah.
It's peanut butter chocolate.

183
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,960
That's a great flavor.
Let me see it.

184
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,711
Hey. We're going out. No ice cream.
No. No.

185
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,797
You see, whiskey doesn't
mix well with ice cream.

186
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,382
Ineedit
DANIEL: Oh, you need it?

187
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,467
Yes. You need it? What're
you, a fat teenage girl?

188
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,635
What're you, Bridget Jones?
Really?

189
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,262
Name calling? Is that
what we're doing? Yeah.

190
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:50,429
Give me the ice cream.
No.

191
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:52,306
Give me the ice cream. I know that look.
Get away from me.

192
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,391
Give me the ice cream.
Back up, little man.

193
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,268
Give me the ice cream.
Get off, man.

194
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:57,353
Nobody gets ice cream!

195
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,437
That was awesome.

196
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,522
Did you throw it
out the window?

197
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,648
We're going out.

198
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:04,026
I mean, I bet you thought you were
never going feel this again, man.

199
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,654
The excitement. The energy. You
don't get this in relationships.

200
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,072
I've been out of
the game so long

201
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,615
I forgot how
much I miss this.

202
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,659
You were never in the game.
You were a married doctor.

203
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,244
Ah, whatever. Hey, do
you guys want a mint?

204
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,370
Yeah.

00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,496

That's for you.

206

That's for you.

207
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,665
That's a weird
mint, dude.

208
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,458
Yeah, I know.
It's Viagra.

209
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,878
You've got four hours to drink like
Keith Richards and still get hard.

has a ticking clock. Right?

211
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,924
Fucking idiots.

I can't wait to
get drunk.

I can't do this.
I can't do this.

219
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,026
Hey, come here.
Yes, you can.

220
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,652
Yes, you can.
You just need to be like,

221
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,279
"Hey! I'm a
good-looking doctor."

222
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,697
No, it would
work for me, Mikey.

223
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,032
Would it?
Yeah, it would.

224
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,783
That would
totally work for me.

your roommate have sex with Hilary

or Emily or whatever the girl's
name is until we fall asleep.

308

And then a year later, we're
still playing beer pong

00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,656
in the same bars
with your friends.

310

that's what I want.

312

if they're going to
think you're smart enough.

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,254

have to drink shitty chardonnay.

garden party.

319
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,506

a drink, though, was it?

proposal.

00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:15,773
(WHISPERING) Bob Barker?

350
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:16,857
Yeah, my dick
looks like Bob Barker.

351
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:19,068
No, you asshole, that thing
that stops the wheel.

352
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,028
What? I think I took
too much Viagra.

353
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,196
I just really
got to take a leak.

354
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,074
You have to just
get horizontal.

355
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,909
Get horizontal?
What the...

356
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,202
You need to be horizontal.

357
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,204
Me or the boner?
Both.

358
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,872
I can't. My boner is
perpendicular to my body.

359
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:32,998
Just try it, man.

360
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,543
<i>This is the stupidest idea I've
ever heard of. What the...</i>

361
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,835
This isn't... Whoa!
(URINATING)

362
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,380
Wait, bro,
it's actually working.

363
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,881
Of course it is,
but, dude, listen to me.

364
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,842
I think the girl that I just
had sex with is a hooker.

365
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,010
What? That's awesome.

366
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,596
No! It's not awesome, man.
What if she makes me pay?

367
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,764
I don't have hooker money.

368
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,349
You definitely don't
have hooker money. Dude.

369
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,976
I don't know what to do,
man. You gotta help me.

370
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,686
Okay, well, you know what?
If she asks for cash,

371
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,312
you could pretend that
you're a hooker, too,

372
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,022
and maybe the rates
would balance out.

373
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:59,066
You are so fucking useless.
Do you know that?

374
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,192
Is your dick
touching the water?

375
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:01,819
Fuck you.

376
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,333
MIKEY: Which one of you
divas uses self-tanner?

377
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,669
I do.Why?

378
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:21,547
Because I beat off
with it last night.

379
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,673
(BOTH LAUGHING)

380
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,758
Why... Why didn't you
even read the bottle?

381
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:25,884
I was a little drunk.

382
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,344
What?
What?

383
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:28,971
My shit is orange.
JASON: Oh!

384
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,515
Oh, my God.Look at this!

385
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:32,600
Oh, no.

386
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,310
Who knew that could
even happen to you?

387
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:35,686
(BOTH CONTINUE LAUGHING)

388
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,147
I didn't know you
could change colors.

389
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,940
Stop.
Your dick looks like a yam.

390
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,817
Your dick looks like a traffic cone.
Just stop.

391
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,236
Your dick looks like
a can of cheddar Pringles.

392
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,279
That's fucked up.

393
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,989
JASON: You dick looks like
Spike Lee at a Knicks game.

394
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:50,242
If your dick was jumping over the
river, it would be the General Lee.

395
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,410
(BOTH LAUGHING)

396
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,954
All right! All right! What happened
to you two idiots last night?

397
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,539
I freaked out and left. I
didn't know what to do.

398
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,374
It's her bread and butter. It's
how she keeps the lights on.

399
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,459
You basically
robbed a hooker.

400
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,127
I didn't rob her.

401
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,295
Yes, you did. You
robbed this hooker, man.

402
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,546
You're like the opposite
of Robin Hood.

403
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,298
I didn't rob her. And
that's the thing. I mean,

404
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,050
everything else
about her was perfect.

405
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,801
I mean, she was smart.
She was funny.

406
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,928
She was the kind of
girl I would date.

407
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,806
If she didn't, you know, happen
to fuck random guys for money.

408
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,642
ALL: Yeah. That's
really the only thing

409
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,143
that's getting in the way
of that relationship.

410
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,353
Fuck you guys.

411
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,271
Did you friend that girl yet, Mikey?
The glasses girl?

412
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,065
No. I mean, can you
even do that that fast?

413
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,941
Dude! You've gotta make her laugh.
Get a rapport going.

414
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,068
Yeah, man. Give me
your phone real quick.

415
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,153
Give him your phone. We live in
an extremely efficient world.

416
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,988
Somebody else could be
sealing the deal right now.

417
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:31,492
Listen, (CHUCKLES) last night was amazing.
Okay? I had a great time.

418
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,077
You guys were awesome.
Thank you.

419
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,995
All right?
But I'm gonna call Vera.

420
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,914
We've got things
that we need to work on.

421
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,332
No. That's a bad move.
Come on.

422
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,500
You don't wanna do that.
Horrible move.

423
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,959
We had so much fun last night.
Yeah.

424
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,002
Wow.

425
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,337
JASON: What?

426
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,421
Uh,she“.

427
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,007
She changed it.

428
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,217
BOTH; What?

429
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,468
What are you talking about?

430
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,722
Uh, Vera.

431
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:56,058
It used to say, "married,"
and now it says...

432
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,478
It says nothing.

433
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,775
All right,
I married a smart girl.

434
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,443
I married the right girl.
Right?

435
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,570
I went to med school
right after college.

436
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,698
I did what I was
supposed to do.

437
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,702
I checked the boxes.

438
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,456
JASON: But maybe what you
did didn't check hers.

439
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,999
MIKEY: We had
the same boxes.

440
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,501
DANIEL: Did you have
the same boxes?

441
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,044
Maybe you need a little
more experience with boxes.

442
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,171
Yeah, maybe we should lead you
down the path to better boxes.

443
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,631
Look, guys. I don't need that.
All right?

444
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,717
I need to call Vera and I
need to work this shit out.

445
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,218
That's what I'm going to do.
I need to call her, okay?

446
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,095
I need to call Vera. I need
to work this shit out.

447
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,304
It kills me to
see you like this.

448
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,639
Yeah.

449
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,599
Hey.

450
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,685
It's an opportunity
to have some fun.

451
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,270
Man, this is about
all of us, man.

452
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,896
This is about all
of us being together.

453
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,481
When are we all
gonna be unattached?

454
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,400
In our 30s we're gonna
settle down with kids.

455
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,861
We're gonna live a boring life.
It's about us right now.

456
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:50,988
I don't know.

457
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,990
We're staying single with you, man.
I just don't know.

458
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,450
We're staying
single with you.

459
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,537
We're gonna keep last night alive
as long as humanly possible.

460
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,038
Nobody gets
in a relationship.

461
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,915
Nobody changes
their status.

462
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,626
Right?

463
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,130
I'm in.

464
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,339
I'm in.

465
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,635
Come on!
Come on!

466
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,095
Come on!
Come on!

467
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,348
Michael? Are you in?

468
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,227
Fuck it. I'm in.

469
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,356
(ALL CHEERING)

470
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,527
So, we going for this?
Yeah.

471
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,074
I mean, it's a pretty
bleak ending to a book,

472
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,494
so shouldn't we leave people
with some hope?

473
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,746
From where in the Midwest
did this one wash up?

474
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,664
Fresh off her master's
from Chicago.

475
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,833
Master's in what?
Sentimentality?

476
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,710
I don't think so.

477
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,671
I just think you have to
believe in possibility.

478
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,548
Oh, sweetie. Welcome
to New York.

479
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,384
You're young and you're pretty
and the world is yours.

480
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,971
But you're nobody's
first wife yet.

481
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,683
Well, we're all pretty...

482
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,393
Oh! Oh, look who's here.
Hi.

483
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,561
FRED: Glad you could make it.

484
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,729
Yeah.

485
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,690
DANIEL: I gotta tell you I'm really
excited about this cover, guys.

486
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:09,983
JASON: (YAWNS) Hey.

487
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,610
Here you go.
Okay.

488
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,320
(SIGHS) Hey-

489
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,072
Holy shit.

490
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,744
Everyone. How's it going?

491
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,371
FRED: Good, good.

492
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,581
Uh...

493
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,588
So, do you want to
tell us a little bit

494
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,924
about your approach
with this cover?

495
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,807
Yeah. I'd love
a little explanation.

496
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,103
Um...

497
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,691
It... (STAMMERING)

498
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,693
It is what it is.

499
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,111
AMANDA: "It is what it is"?

500
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,238
That's what you say when
you get a parking ticket.

501
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,447
I know.

502
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,200
It looks to me like the
guy here wants to escape.

503
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,286
Hmm. Does he?

504
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,456
AMANDA: And we want him to stay.
That's the fantasy of men in the city.

505
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,876
It seems like she'll bring
him home in the bag,

506
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,837
totally trusting him and then
after they sleep together,

507
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,797
he'll prove to be
too much of an asshole

508
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,383
to actually stick around
for a couple of hours.

509
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:22,139
So tell me, Jason.
Why wouldn't the guy stay?

510
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,433
Hmm?

511
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,435
I thought
you were a hooker.

512
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:28,979
What?

513
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,063
A hooker.

514
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,148
Why?

515
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,232
There were hooker signs.

516
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,358
What's a hooker sign?

517
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,027
You had on hooker boots.
Lots of people have them.

518
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,069
There were tons of condoms.

519
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,195
Did you ever think
they might be there

520
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,363
because I'm not
having a ton of sex?

521
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,948
No! I thought they
were a hooker sign!

522
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,074
What's a hooker sign?

523
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,618
<i>What about The Story of O?</i>

524
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,244
That was research
for a book.

525
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,746
There were
envelopes full of cash.

526
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:49,499
I pay my landlord in cash so
that he can commit tax fraud.

527
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,835
How long have you
lived in New York?

528
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,254
Man, not long enough.

529
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,756
Yeah.

530
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,799
Wait. Can I make it
up to you?

531
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,718
Let me make it up to you.

532
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,013
You wanna make
it up to me?

533
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,307
Can I?

534
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,562
I don't know.

535
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:15,859
You can have my number.

536
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,528
And...

537
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,365
Maybe you can.

538
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,594
Yeah, dude. Everybody knows you
can't call a girl a hooker.

539
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,179
Even hookers hate
being called hookers.

540
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,681
I'm gonna bring
Ellie around.

541
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,849
No, you're not!
No, you're not.

542
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,017
I'm gonna get her
on the roster.

543
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,185
Wait. A roster?

544
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,269
Yeah. A roster.

545
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,521
It's a group of girls
that you're hooking up with

546
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:53,855
that keeps you from sending
the wrong message.

547
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,649
Which is what? That you
wanna date one of them.

548
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,234
You gotta start
building a roster.

549
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,652
Yeah. It'll help ease
the transition a little.

550
00:21:58,735 --> 00:21:59,778
No, no. I do not need a roster.
Okay?

551
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:00,821
Yes, you do.

552
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:01,989
I can't keep one girl.

553
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,240
What makes you think I can
handle a bunch of them?

554
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,950
You just keep a bunch of them
for a short period of time

555
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,535
and then you send them out
into the world to flourish.

556
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,786
Like college kids.
Yes.

557
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,121
Or like capitalism.

558
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,497
And then you
replenish the team.

559
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,041
Think of a roster like a
spiritual and physical...

560
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,209
Mostly physical.

561
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,836
...rejuvenation
of the male soul.

562
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,546
Which you guys clearly
don't fucking have.

563
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:18,797
Think of it like a spa.

564
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,215
A spa for your cock.

565
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,009
A cock spa.
Yep.

566
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,552
You just got to
use whatever skills

567
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,137
that you have available to you.
Mmm.

568
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,930
Girls love
personalization.

569
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,015
You guys are idiots.

570
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,099
You're an idiot.

571
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:32,978
(DOOR OPENS)

572
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,521
Vera!

573
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,691
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
to barge in on you.

574
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,109
What are you doing here?

575
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,820
Okay, look.

576
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:46,158
I know that this is an
awkward thing to do, but...

577
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,327
Um...

578
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:53,874
I have been
having some pain.

579
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,793
And, um, I just...

580
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,589
I don't know.

581
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,883
You came because
you needed my help.

582
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,593
I came to apologize.
I did.

583
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,386
You came because you needed my help.
Mikey.

584
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,725
I just... I've been
thinking about you.

585
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,946
It really was just
a simple misunderstanding.

586
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,280
Yeah, it was like, "What
kind of girl would I be

587
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,116
"if I didn't eventually
find it funny?"

588
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:12,702
You'd be probably every other
girl in the world. I think.

589
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:15,831
I'm really sorry.

590
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,625
But I'm not every
other girl in the world.

591
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,793
No.

592
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,169
I guess you're not.

593
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,839
And then I kind of developed
my own style, I guess.

594
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,465
And now you...

595
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,175
Design book covers.

596
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,677
Amongst other things.

597
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,971
Well, I guess you get people
to believe in something enough

598
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,305
to want to buy it.

599
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,641
I get people to
believe in the surface.

600
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,602
To do the one thing your
parents told you not to do.

601
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,604
To judge a book
by its cover.

602
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:40,856
Exactly.

603
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,607
Oh, we weren't
supposed to do that.

604
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:43,984
You weren't
supposed to do that.

605
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,069
See? I was encouraged.

606
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,655
Another example of
just plain awful parenting.

607
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,451
But, like, the job
that you have right now,

608
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,412
like, is it something that you
actually want to be doing?

609
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,831
You know what?
It can be fun.

610
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,583
But do I love it?

611
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,876
You don't.
No.

612
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,627
Don't you want
to love something?

613
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,590
What? Do you love
what you do?

614
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,758
I started this
new lecture series.

615
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,261
And authors can come along and
they can talk about their work.

616
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:12,470
That's awesome.
Yes. So great.

617
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,014
And people come?
No.

618
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,599
No?
No. (LAUGHS)

619
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,309
But I...

620
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,936
It's okay. I mean, I figure
that if I keep doing It,

621
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,771
it could be a really,
really amazing thing.

622
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,190
(LAUGHING)

623
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,944
You should come along to one
of them if you're around.

624
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,029
Oh, I don't know.

625
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,448
I can't really tell if
it's important to you.

626
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,116
(LAUGHING)

627
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,330
I'm sorry.
That's a weird laugh.

628
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,797
ELLIE: This is my favorite
place in the city.

629
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,008
JASON: Yeah.
It's beautiful.

630
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:55,847
(LAUGHS) I know that I'm
romanticizing the idea,

631
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,642
but come on.

632
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:03,271
That's kind of my dream. To
have the key to Gramercy Park.

633
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:08,902
New York's charm is you're
surrounded by things you can't have.

634
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:14,032
New York's charm is it makes
you think you can have them.

635
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:25,252
You know, I'd love to look
inside before we buy.

636
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,295
Me, too.

637
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,423
In the meantime,
we can go back to my place.

638
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,717
It's very similar, actually.

639
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:35,845
Except for
everything about it.

640
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,348
I gotta get home.

641
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,808
Okay. Yours, it is.

642
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:41,434
You're one hell
of a negotiator.

643
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:45,105
This kind of stuff just rolls
off your tongue doesn't it?

644
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:47,399
I'm just trying
to make you laugh.

645
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:01,246
I don't like how
well it's working.

646
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,795
(SIGHS) Fuck...

647
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,759
CHELSEA: Wait, so you guys still
haven't gotten Mikey laid?

648
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:15,802
No.
What's wrong with you?

649
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:16,886
You're like
the worst wingman ever.

650
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,805
Are you kidding me, Chelsea?
I'm an incredible wingman.

651
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,015
I know, but, like, nothing?

652
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,141
It's just harder
than you think with him.

653
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,183
Like, what about a blowjob?

654
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,601
I'm good right now,
but thank you.

655
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,936
Uh-huh.
Maybe in, like, 10 minutes?

656
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,979
Maybe after this beer?

657
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,063
Sorry, I'm just
making a mental list

658
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,024
of all the things I'd like to
do before giving you a blowjob.

659
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,358
Wow. Really?

660
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,861
Oh! Kill myself
is number one.

661
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,612
Are you serious?
Jesus. What's number two?

662
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,198
Uh... Just, like,
awaiting trial in Guantanamo.

663
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,825
Mmm-hmm? Yup.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

664
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,203
Oh, come on, man. The blues?
Are you fucking serious?

665
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,999
What the fuck does Captain
Attractive have to be so sad about?

666
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,500
I don't know.

667
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:52,213
I think he's going for
brooding and dark, mysterious.

668
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,340
It's kind of working for me.

669
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,632
That is working?
Yes.

670
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,177
You cannot be that attractive and
have a skill. That's bullshit.

671
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,095
Well, I'm gonna play,
so you're wrong.

672
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,056
Ooh, then somebody's
in trouble.

673
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,141
Cheer up, asshole.
You're the guy.

674
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,518
Buckle up.

675
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,437
Hey, excuse me? I just wanted
to tell you great job.

676
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,938
I almost cried right there.

677
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,648
It was really
some powerful stuff.

678
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,609
Yeah. It was brooding, dark,
and mysterious, apparently.

679
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,444
Yeah. Thanks.That's
what I was going for.

680
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:15,862
Told you.

681
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:16,905
This is my friend, Chelsea.

682
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,574
She's not much to look at, but wait
till you hear her play the piano.

683
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:20,784
Really good.

684
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,035
I can't wait. I'm Diego.

685
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:23,870
I know you are.

686
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,581
I warn you, though. She can be
really aggressive sometimes.

687
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:27,707
(LAUGHS) Is that right?

688
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,918
But you can tame her with
tequila and compliments.

689
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,044
Yeah.
So...

690
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,587
Super aggressive.
Oh, yeah?

691
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,755
Hey, are you home?

692

It was amazing, man.
She was amazing.

697
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,305

Yeah. I worked out
once. 2004.

723
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,447
Got on the 15 dumbbells.

724
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,449
I was like, "Those are way too
light, let me go to the 30s."

00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:25,492
Nice.
And if you feel it...

Don't. I don't
wanna touch it.

727
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:27,827

729
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,663

What do you mean?
I don't know.

736
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,093
Weren't you supposed to hang out
with that girl from Trinity?

737
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:49,432
Oh, yeah. I had to tell her I wasn't
looking for anything too serious.

I don't know. I just
thought you liked her.

745
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,444
I did like her.

746
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,072
She was cool, really smart,
funny, well-read.

747
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:05,865
Great family.
Love it

748
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,867
And gave the best blowjob
in recorded history.

749
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,452
I feel like every
blowjob you get,

750
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:11,120
you think is the best
in recorded history...

751
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,997
Well, if you look at
the common variable

752
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,958
across all encounters,
you'll find that it's me.

753
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,294
So maybe I'm the best in recorded
history at receiving blowjobs.

is this going?

Look, I think
you're an amazing girl.

764
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,480
And if I was in
a different place, maybe,

765
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:21,065
but, I mean,
you know that I'm not

766
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,734
really looking for
anything serious.

767
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:26,070
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. As soon as this
stops being fun for one of us.

768
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:37,790
Hey, J-Go! How'd it
go with that hooker?

769
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh!

770
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,461
Did you just
call me a hooker?

771
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,296
No, I meant
the other... Um...

772
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,049
Yeah. I just said
the wrong thing just now.

773
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,508
You think?

774
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,344
Yes.

Can you shut the door?
Oh, shit.

778
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,317
Okay. I'd like to
apologize.

779
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,401
Don't worry about it.

781
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:09,280
No, thanks. I gotta run.

782
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,908
But at least he offers.

783
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:12,992
I offer.

784
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,077
You've never offered.

785
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,995
For the record. I'm
sorry for anything I said.

786
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,498
Am saying. And might
say in the future.

787
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,750
An apology. So sweet.

788
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,835
I like him better than you.
For the record.

789
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,921

he is better than me.

792
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,178
So you went outwith...
Ellie.

793
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,262
Then you came home
and had sex with...

794
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,472
Alana.

795
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:35,723
Jesus!

796
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,558
I did that for you.
You did it for me?

797
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,352
Yeah. You had sex with a
beautiful woman for me?

798
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,436
Yeah. For you.

799
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,771
Thank you. Thank you.

800
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,273
If I need anything else, I'll
be sure to let you know.

801
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,650
I'm just building
my roster, man.

802
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,151
Roster?
Yeah, my roster.

803
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,194
Ellie's on the way in.

804
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,612
Alana just gave me
the "so."

805
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,822
The "so"?

806
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:51,864
Yeah, the "so."

807
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:55,076
When it comes to girls, nothing
good ever follows the word "so."

808
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,911
"So," where is this going?

809
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,496
"So," what're we doing?

810
00:33:58,579 --> 00:33:59,706
And you just got the "so"?

811
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,249
Yeah, I just got the "so."

812
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:02,709
So that's when you get out.

813
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:03,793
Always?

814
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:04,961

her magic again?

817
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:23,104
Yeah, yeah. In a sense, yeah.
Really?

818
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,939
So, is she, like, hot.
She smart, cool?

819
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,649
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
all of the above.

820
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:27,900
Wow, really?

821
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,277
Yeah. I'm not
gonna date her.

822
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,237
She's not datable if that's
what you're getting at, okay?

823
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,030
So let's just calm down.

824
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:34,991
What about you? Did you
see what's-her-name?

825
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,117
Ellie?
Oh, yeah.

826
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,994
Yeah. We, like, went to the park.
We hung out.

827
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,245
Went to the park,
hung out?

828
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,247

thought she was a hooker.

No, man.

I think you are. I can
hear it in your voice.

832
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:47,754
I had sex with Alana.

833
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,338
You had sex with both of them?
No.

834
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,882
You fucking
double gophered?

835
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,300
I didn't.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

836
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:54,260
You double gophered?
I love that.

837
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,762
You had sex with both of them.
That's awesome.

838
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,181
No, I didn't. Ellie went home.
Alana came over.

839
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,390
That's what
I love about you.

840

push too hard.

841
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,059

Mmm-hmm. l thought you
worked tonight?

866
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,362
She might come by the hospital.
No.

867
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:56,322
Mikey, I love your
thinking on this, man.

868
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,824
The work-date combination.

869
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:58,991
It's very impressive.
Yeah.

870
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:00,076
I'm just thinking on my toes.

871
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,160
JASON: He knows shit, man.

872
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:03,079
It's casual.
lt's innovative.

873
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,789
Mmm.
I love your work, man.

874
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,625
I love that jacket.
Where are you going tonight?

875
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,793
I have a pretty big
night ahead of me.

876
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:12,004
I'm playing the incredibly
wealthy Mr. Von Ferrington.

877
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:13,548
That's so awesome!

878
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:14,966
You're role playing.
You're committing.

879
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,050
Exactly. What
are you doing?

880
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,134
I'm going to
meet up with Chelsea

881
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,177
and see what we
can make happen.

882
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:19,262
Again?

883
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,429
Why is she always hooking
you up with girls?

884
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:21,889
Have you looked in the mirror?
Have you looked at me?

885
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,599
I'm the most attractive.
So it's the easiest.

886
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,142
Come on.
Yeah! That's why.

887
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,603
Guys, in high school, I was voted
most likely to have the best eyes.

888
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,313
MIKEY: That's just not true.
So...

889
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:30,398
Yeah, right.

890
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,400
You idiot.

891
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,492
MRS. ROSE: Do you know that
James Harper lived here?

892
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:43,202
JASON: Really? He used to
be the mayor of New York.

893
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:47,540
You've really chosen a wonderful
property to look at Mr. Von...

894
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:48,666
Ferrington.
Ferrington.

895
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,376
Von Ferrington.
Von Ferrington.

896
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,796
I mean, this is one of the
finest properties in the city.

897
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,882
Thank you.
You're welcome.

898
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,304
Look at the parquet floors that
are all inlaid and original.

899
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,847
And this.

900
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,974
Let me show you this.

901
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:10,396
Unfettered access
to the private park

902
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,566
is, of course, one of the finest
things about living on Gramercy.

903
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:14,817
Unfettered?

904
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,110
Unfettered.

905
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:21,741
And now further, I'd like you to
take a look at this wrought iron.

906
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:23,159
Lattice wrought iron
which is the original.

907
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,702
Original?

908
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,454
And we have in
here a beautiful,

909
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,205
beautiful,
beautiful chandelier,

910
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,749
which is cut crystal.

911
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,752
You'll notice all of the
detail on the ceiling.

912
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:36,589
Now the Obasan rug is
original of the period.

913
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,467
And we have over there
a stained glass window.

914
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,345
Let's go.
Why?

915
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,931
Look at the detail
on this poster here.

916
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,892
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
I'll explain later.

917
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,061
Oh, here, the kitchen.

918
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:51,687
Quick! The old
woman's coming!

919
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,023
Hello?

920
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:55,900
Won't we get caught?

921
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,485
I don't think so.
Let's go.

922
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:58,903
Hello?

923
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,905
Mr. Ferrington?

924
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:01,989
Hello?

925
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:05,368
Whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down.
Just walk normal.

926
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:06,535
What do you mean walk...

927
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:08,496
You're walking like a criminal.
What? This is how I walk.

928
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:09,622
I'm not a criminal.

929
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,248
But I am.

930
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,460
We have to go. Let's go!

931
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:15,920
Hello?

932
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:17,713
Hello?

933
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,635
Okay. You said
we need to talk.

934
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:23,719
Nobody says,
"We need to talk,"

935
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:24,887
unless it's
really bad news, right?

936
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:25,972
No,no,no.

937
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:27,098
And my grandmother
had ovarian cancer.

938
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,141
No,no,no. You're fine,
you're fine, you're fine!

939
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,310
The tests they ran indicated
nothing out of the ordinary.

940
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:32,520
I have all the symptoms.
Baby, you're fine.

941
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:33,646
You're fine. You're okay.

942
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:34,689
Come here.
What was that message then?

943
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:36,399
Come here. No, no.
Come here.

944
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:39,068
Okay. I am sorry.
I just wanted to talk.

945
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:41,529
Oh, my God.
You are such an idiot.

946
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,114
You are such an idiot.

947
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,365
Yes.

948
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,617
Just... Just...
Just come sit down. Okay?

949

(SIGHS)

950
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,079
Oh, God.

951
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:53,290
Breathe. Breathe.

952
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,418
Oh, God, I thought
I was dying.

953
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:58,087
(LAUGHS)

954
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,342
Yeah. You thought
you were dying.

955
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,760
That was me.

956

(EXHALES)

957
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,353
Where did we go wrong?

958
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:19,066
Like, what happened?

959
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,192
What happened to us?

960
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,821
What happened? I...

961
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,241
I mean, we got
married at 23 years old,

962
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,327
I just don't think at that
point you are ready for a life

963
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,788
without excitement
or spontaneity.

964
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,540
Spontaneity?

965
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:36,000
I mean, I'm spontaneous.

966
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,047
We didn't have sex
for almost six months.

967
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:43,257
You want spontaneous?

968
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,392
Hey.
Hi.

969
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,061
Are you sick or something?
No.

970
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,562
Those aren't
going out clothes.

971
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,022
Well, who's going out?

972
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,899
I thought we were going out.

973
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,902
BOTH: Oh!

974
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,988
That was pretty badass.
Mmm-hmm.

975
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,656
I can get fired
for that shit.

976
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:40,106
You know, when I was a kid, I
used to love going to parks.

977
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:45,152
And my grandfather
used to take me every Sunday.

978
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:48,197
But my ex hated parks.

979
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,909
He thought they were
like too public or something.

980
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,869
He sounds
like a real dick.

981
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,121
What? My ex?

982
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,413
Your grandfather.

(LAUGHING)

984
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,459
So what happened
between the two of you?

985
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,630
Well, I graduated from school
and I moved to New York.

986
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,133
And he took a job in Chicago.

987
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:12,805
And it was sort of like a
focus-on-your-work-life-first sort of thing.

988
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,474
They call us
the selfish generation.

989
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:19,812
What about you?

990
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:25,860
Who's the one that got you?

991
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,655
How dare you
assume that I have

992
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,657
any emotional
capacity whatsoever?

993
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,242
Get out of my park.
No.

994
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,869
Get out.
No.

995
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,872
It's okay.
You can come back.

996
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,385
Damn it!

997
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:53,179
I was so not gonna do that.

998
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:54,430
I was gonna hold out.

999
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,849
I was gonna make you wait,
like, 40 days or something.

1000
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,185
I was gonna
make you wait, too,

1001
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,604

"I'm a dude."

Jesus! Fred, you're like
Reverse Elvis, you know.

00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,377
Fred, you entered

What's up, Fred?

1009
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:42,061
Well, Ellie from Simon just sent
over the Matterhorn book cover.

1010
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:44,230
And she wants us
to do it?

1011
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:45,522
Specifically.

1012
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:46,649

00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:00,996

00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,582
Thanks, Fred.
Yeah.

All right.

1019
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,876
Gonna do it!

Wait, okay, so let me
get this straight.

1021
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:13,092
You have sex with this girl.
We get a job out of it?

1022
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,260
Certainly seems that way.

1023
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:17,680
And to think this whole time, we
thought that poor girl was a hooker.

1024
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,431
Well, yeah.

1025
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:23,560
But in reality, the only
prostitute here is you.

00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:09,257
And you know. And all that stuff.
Oh, really? Yeah.

1208
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:12,427
And my boner just started
to wilt like warm lettuce.

1209
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:13,929
I'm gonna get rid
of the teddy bear!

1210
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:15,180
Thank you.

1211
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,018
Creeped me out.
Yeah.

1212
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:21,353
Um...

1213
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:23,814
Chelsea, I just really
want you to know something.

1214
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:25,357
And I wanted to
be very clear.

1215
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,527
You're not looking for
anything serious right now?

1216
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:33,448
Look, Daniel, this thing
doesn't have to be a thing.

1217
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,159
And if you want to go
back to being friends,

1218
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,120
we can go back
to being friends.

1219
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:39,913
I don't want to go
back to anything.

1220
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:41,832
That's what I was
going to tell you.

1221
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,252
I really like being here.

1222
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:51,633
That's what
I was going to say.

1223
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:00,308
You working this weekend?
Mmm-hmm.

1224
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:04,146
You should come
by the hospital.

1225
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:05,230
Again.

1226
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,314
Yeah. Again.

1227
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:07,441
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

1228
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:08,859
Yeah, I would.

1229
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:11,987
Come by again and
again and again.

1230
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:16,908
<i>DANIEL: Check this one out.</i>

1231
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:18,493
That's impressive.
Very impressive.

1232
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:19,828
STORE OWNER: Something
for the two of you?

1233
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:21,413
What's up, man?

1234
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,873
Something for the two of you?

1235
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:26,752
Oh, no, no, no.
We're not gay, man.

1236
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:28,628
And we're just... We just
need a giant strap-on dildo.

1237
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,381
Which I know sounds a little gay.
But it's for a costume.

1238
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:34,801
It's right here.
Right in front of you.

1239
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:37,220
Wait.lhave a serious
question for you. Yeah.

1240
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:38,597
Think.

1241
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,766
If you were gay,
would you date me?

1242
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:42,100
Definitely not.

1243
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:43,351
What?
What?

1244
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:44,978
I would not
date you, Jason.

1245
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:45,729
Why?

1246
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:47,147
Because
you're not my type.

1247
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,024
What the fuck
does that mean?

1248
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:50,192
Oh, what?
Are you offended?

1249
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:51,526
I'm completely offended.

1250
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,861
Deal with it.

1251
00:51:54,196 --> 00:51:56,323
You'd gay date me.
You know you would.

1252
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:58,533
Honestly, if were to have
sex with you, Jason,

1253
00:51:58,617 --> 00:52:00,285
which apparently
you really want,

1254
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,579
you would probably be like
top three hottest chicks

1255
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:03,705
I've ever had sex with.

1256
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:05,457
That's actually true.
Mmm-hmm.

1257
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,833
Man, how much are these?

1258
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:08,752
For you? $75.

1259
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:11,254
For me? 'Cause
we're such good friends?

1260
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:14,424
These are all
dishwasher safe.

1261
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:16,301
I don't think you should
go to this party, man.

1262
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,261
Dude,I can go to the party.
It's gonna be fun.

1263
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:19,346
$65.

1264
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:21,932
Dude, who the fuck are you
negotiating with right now?

1265
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:24,434
$60.

1266
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:27,354
Okay. Look. I'm
telling you, man.

1267
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:28,814
This party is a road
to a relationship.

1268
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:32,150
And that road is paved with
responsibility and lack of selfishness.

1269
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:34,402
And what the fuck am I holding right now?
What is this?

1270
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:35,612
I have no idea.

1271
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:39,533
Ah!
Clever.

1272
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,244
It comes with
an extra balloon.

1273
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:43,662
Why would I need
an extra balloon?

1274
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,455
In case it pops.
Why would it pop?

1275
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:48,124
If you try too hard.

1276
00:52:50,252 --> 00:52:51,419

Yeah.

I mean,
I told them everything.

Yeah. I mean, he was
a little angry at first,

1349
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:45,862
but now he's in the
fourth stage of grieving.

1350
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,280
Denial?

00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:48,990

I'm, like, really funny."

1355
00:56:56,498 --> 00:56:57,832
I don't sound
anything like that.

1356
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:58,917
You sound exactly like that.

No.
What do you want me to say?

1360

that I'm slumming it?

Slumdogging?

1362
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:15,558
No. Honestly, I'm just
happy you told them.

00:57:16,643 --> 00:57:18,895

Well, he likes you, too, even
though you had that thing on.

1370
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:43,795
Maybe that's why he liked me.

You know you don't have to
clear up anything.

1372

You don't have to help.

1373

No, I want to.

1376

You've always hated me.

1377
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:00,353
Just stop talking
for one minute.

1378
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:02,897

but you can just try.

1386
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,608
Last night was amazing.

1387
00:58:48,276 --> 00:58:49,611
And this morning.

could grow old in New York?</i>

1390

I'm not gonna get old.

1391
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:57,785
Getting old looks
so tiring.

1392
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:00,371
I know. You just, like,
wake up in the morning

1393
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:03,041
and have to figure out what
to do in between meals.

1394
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:04,500
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

1395
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:08,630
I'm gonna get an old Jaguar
XK-E, completely restored.

1396
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:10,715
And then I'm gonna
eat a ton of acid.

1397
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:14,260
Like, so much acid that if you
went to go see Cirque du Soleil,

1398
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:16,262
you'd think you
were in Connecticut.

(LAUGHING)

1400
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:20,225
And then I'm gonna speed up
the West Side Highway,

1401
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:23,561
as fast as a car can go,
crash through the divider,

1402
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:25,730
and careen off
into the Hudson.

1403
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:27,523
In slow-motion,
of course.

1404
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:28,983
Of course.

1405
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:30,568
And that would be it.

1406
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,987
My death, premeditated.

1407
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:34,948
Okay.

1408
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:37,033
I mean, here's what's
actually gonna happen.

1409
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:38,785
What?

1410
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:41,162
You'll be 70 years old.

1411
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:43,164
So you'll think
you're going 150,

1412
00:59:43,248 --> 00:59:45,583
but actually you're going
25 at best, 15 at worst.

1413
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:48,711
You can't see, so the acid
you think you're eating

1414
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:50,421
will actually be
an errant Lipitor.

1415
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:53,007
You're going to forget what you were
doing in the car in the first place,

1416
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:55,093
bump into the divider,
wet yourself, ruin the car,

1417
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:57,428
lose your license, and your
dignity in one fell swoop.

1418
00:59:57,512 --> 01:00:00,181
And then you're gonna be ushered
off into some rest home,

1419
01:00:00,265 --> 01:00:01,266
where you have to
wake up in the mornings,

1420
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:04,018
and figure out what the hell
to do in between meals.

1421
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,982
You know, you don't have to be right
about everything all the time?

Why are you so happy?
Yeah?

I can't be happy to
see my two best friends?

01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:55,159
And being there for someone
when they need you?

1714
01:14:55,242 --> 01:15:00,122
That's all
relationships are, Jason.

1715
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,419
That's all they are.

1716
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:14,821
You Okay?

1717
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:18,408
Yeah, I'm fine.

1718
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,210
I just can't...

1719
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:32,589
Can't stop thinking
about what she's doing.

1720
01:16:33,507 --> 01:16:34,967
Like, when I'm not there.

1721
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:40,931
I know what the couch
looks like at her place.

1722
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:45,435
I just can't stop
imagining the different

1723
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:48,188
people that are
all sitting on it.

1724
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:51,817
A guy.

1725
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:54,361
A different guy.

1726
01:16:55,112 --> 01:16:56,363
A new guy-

1727
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:00,117
Just every guy but me.

1728
01:17:01,285 --> 01:17:02,953
Sitting on that couch.

1729
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:07,541
Well,

1730
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:13,130
it sounds to me like
you just need to get laid.

1731
01:17:20,512 --> 01:17:21,805
(BOTH MOANING)

1732
01:17:21,888 --> 01:17:23,307
I know this is
gonna sound crazy.

1733
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,516
Then don't say it.
No.

1734
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:28,645
This is gonna sound even more
crazy, given the new information.

1735
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:29,980
Shh.
No, listen.

1736
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:35,027
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1737
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:36,445
Wow. What?

1738
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:42,534
I'm just still
getting over someone.

1739
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:45,329
Come on. You're gonna
go full-girl with it?

1740
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:49,750
I think I made
a terrible mistake.

1741
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:53,295
I know I can be selfish,
arrogant,

1742
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,339
distant and
emotionally retarded.

1743
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:56,965
I'm just gonna stop
you right there because

1744
01:17:57,049 --> 01:18:01,053
whatever it is that you're doing
right now is not what we do.

1745
01:18:01,136 --> 01:18:03,680
I just needed
somebody to talk to.

1746
01:18:03,764 --> 01:18:05,015
Jason?

1747
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:07,476
Don't you have any friends?

1748
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,156
(DOOR CLOSING)

1749
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:40,884
These actually
do go together.

1750
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:43,470
Didn't see that coming.

1751
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:47,641
I'm sorry.

1752
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:49,810
I know.

1753
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:56,983
I just...

1754
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:58,276
I don't know,
to be honest, I'm having

1755
01:18:58,402 --> 01:18:59,569
so much fun
hanging out, you know,

1756
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:02,155
and chasing girls.
And doing the thing and...

1757
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:04,366
"Doing the thing"?
Yeah, I miss that.

1758
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,201
And I'm not gonna be able to
do that if I'm with Chelsea.

1759
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:07,452
You know that.

1760
01:19:07,619 --> 01:19:08,745
I know.

1761
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,080
Okay.

1762
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,917
Go tell her how you feel.

1763
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,043
Go make a scene.

1764
01:19:15,168 --> 01:19:16,211
Yeah.

1765
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:18,046
Make a public spectacle.
Yeah.

1766
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,090
Dude. Go big.
Do it like the movies.

1767
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:21,174
Like the movies. Yeah.

1768
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:22,467
Like Jerry Maguire.
I love that movie.

1769
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:23,969
I love that movie, man!
So good.

1770
01:19:24,052 --> 01:19:25,303
"You had me at hello."
What?

1771
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:26,888
Don't ever do that again.
Okay? Sorry.

1772
01:19:26,972 --> 01:19:28,348
But tell me what you
love about her, man!

1773
01:19:28,432 --> 01:19:29,975
What do you love about her?
I love the way she laughs.

1774
01:19:30,058 --> 01:19:32,561
I like the way she fake laughs
when she knows that I need it.

1775
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:33,687
Yes.

1776
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:34,896
I love the way we
fit together in bed.

1777
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,982
Because we're the same height,
our crotches line up perfectly.

1778
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:38,066
That's really good.

1779
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,401
I love that about it!

1780
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:40,610
I mean, what are
the chances, right?

1781
01:19:40,694 --> 01:19:43,905
I love the way that
she looks in the morning.

1782
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:45,782
Like at that exact moment
when she wakes up,

1783
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:47,784
and her eyes just open
like two little butterflies.

1784
01:19:47,868 --> 01:19:49,161
Two little...
I love that!

1785
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:50,287
I love that!

1786
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,621
Yeah, man.
But I wouldn't go there.

1787
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:53,290
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
Okay.

1788
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:54,458
So run and tell her that.
I'm gonna go.

1789
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:56,126
Don't go all Notebook with it.
But run and tell her that.

1790
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:57,419
I'm doing it.
Do it.

1791
01:19:57,502 --> 01:19:58,503
I'm doing it.
Do it, man.

1792
01:19:58,587 --> 01:19:59,713
I'm going.
Let's do it.

1793
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:00,797
I'm gonna do it!

1794
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:01,882
Man, you're doing it!

1795
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:04,092
(HORN HONKING)
Oh, shit!

1796
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:05,844
Oh, my God!

1797
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:07,846
Dude?
MAN: Someone call 911!

1798
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:14,394
You took, like, four bags of fluid.
You were severely dehydrated.

1799
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:15,645
Oop!

1800
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:17,731
You need to be housebroken.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1801
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:23,487
I mean, what the hell
were you doing?

1802
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:24,779
I was running.

1803
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:25,906
Why?

1804
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:27,240
Because I...

1805
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:29,576
I'm sorry.

1806
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:31,912
I'm really, really sorry. I was
running to tell you that I'm sorry.

1807
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,334
And I should have told these
guys that we were dating.

1808
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:40,128
From the beginning,
I told him that.

1809
01:20:40,212 --> 01:20:41,713
We tried to convince
him the whole time.

1810
01:20:42,339 --> 01:20:44,591
I want to date you, Chels.

1811
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:48,553
Like... Like,
really date you.

1812
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:51,890
I want that, too.

1813
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,100
Oh!

1814
01:20:57,521 --> 01:20:59,105
You're such an idiot.

1815
01:21:08,532 --> 01:21:10,033

wondering if you'd call.</i>

<i>I'd love to see you.</i>

1819
01:21:22,546 --> 01:21:24,506
No, seriously,
that took forever.

1821
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:28,593
I'd love to see you again.

Ah! That's what
I'm talking about.

1823
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:33,265
Honestly? Who
waits that long?

this guy is.

Oh, my God. Dude.

1836
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:01,561
I mean, honestly,
I just find it disgusting.

1837
01:23:01,645 --> 01:23:03,438
The way that you guys
embrace the single life.

1838
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:04,981
The women?
The carousing?

all of two minutes.

a righteous asshole.

Guys, look,
I'm just in love and shit.

1843
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:14,407
And I've had a lot of
time to sit and realize

1844
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:16,826
how disgusting
both of you are.

1845

Mostly you, Jason.
MIKEY: What about me?

1846

You're the worst. You're
pretty disgusting, too.

You're gross.
I'm a killer.

1848
01:23:22,123 --> 01:23:24,167
What the... Did you...

1849
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:26,544
Did you post a funny
video on Ellie's wall?

1850
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:27,962
No.

1851
01:23:28,046 --> 01:23:31,549
Yes, you did, because I'm
looking at it right now, Jason!

1852
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:33,760
What is it, funny cute?
Or is it just funny?

1853
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:37,013
It is funny cute!
Jason, you pussy!

1854
01:23:37,097 --> 01:23:38,765
You funny cute videoed her?

I... Yes. I guess.
I don't freaking know...

I don't know
what I'm doing, man.

1857
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:45,021
Hey, man.
I think he loves her.

1858
01:23:45,105 --> 01:23:46,147
I think that's love!

1859
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:47,315
It sounds
like love to me.

1860
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:48,400
I don't know, man.
I don't know. Maybe I do.

1861
01:23:48,525 --> 01:23:49,526
MIKEY: What do you mean,
you don't know?

1862
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:54,864
Well, then you have to tell her.
DANIEL: You have to.

1863
01:23:54,948 --> 01:23:56,408
It'll be funny cute.
Maybe I should tell her.

1864
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:58,868
Which is right up your alley.
You love that shit.

Ha,ha,ha.
Asshole.

1866

I don't even know where to...

1867
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:05,375
What's she doing? Let's stop by her place.
Where's she at right now?

1868
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:07,669
Third Tuesday of the month.
She's at one of her readings.

1869
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,755
Whoa. That... That was
some stalker shit.

1870
01:24:10,839 --> 01:24:12,048
That's creepy.

1871
01:24:12,132 --> 01:24:13,383
It's creepy
that you know that.

does anybody go?

1873
01:24:14,801 --> 01:24:16,052
No! Nobody ever goes.

Nobody.

1875
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,806
Well, then, you are
going to be the guy

1876
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:23,184

Something.

that I would like to read.

1889
01:25:04,893 --> 01:25:06,102
From my novel.

1890
01:25:06,436 --> 01:25:07,604

(SIGHS)

1900
01:25:40,053 --> 01:25:42,639
And then the other guy
asked to buy her a drink,

1901
01:25:42,806 --> 01:25:44,307
right as Jason walked up.

1902
01:25:44,849 --> 01:25:46,100
And so she asked that guy,

1903
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:49,312
"What happens
if I enjoy the drink?

1904
01:25:50,021 --> 01:25:51,231
"What happens then?"

1905
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:55,819
And he pretended not to know the answer.
So she told him.

1906
01:25:56,778 --> 01:25:58,780
She asked if they
would play beer pong

1907
01:25:58,947 --> 01:26:00,365
in that shitty bar
with his friends

1908
01:26:00,532 --> 01:26:03,201
until they headed back
to his place in Murray Hill.

1909
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:06,496
She asked if they'd have to
listen to his roommate

1910
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:09,749
fuck Hilary or Emily,
or whatever her name was

1911
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:11,459
till they fell asleep.

1912
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:14,504
And she asked him
if a year later,

1913
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:16,548
they'd still be
there in that bar.

1914
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:21,594
The only difference being that now
he feels pressure to get married

1915
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:25,473
and have kids, because he thinks
that that's what she wants.

1916
01:26:27,267 --> 01:26:28,810
And then in the summers,

1917
01:26:29,269 --> 01:26:31,104
they would drive up
to the shitty Hamptons.

1918
01:26:32,814 --> 01:26:35,066
To meet his shitty parents.

1919
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:38,111
Wondering the entire ride if they'd
think that she was pretty enough.

1920
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:40,363
Smart.

1921
01:26:40,655 --> 01:26:43,157
Wondering the entire ride if
they think she's smart enough.

1922
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,368
Because no one was.

1923
01:26:45,535 --> 01:26:47,370
And no one ever will be.

1924
01:26:53,668 --> 01:26:55,378
And Jason knew that now.

1925
01:26:57,297 --> 01:27:01,467
And he would give anything
to go back to that moment.

1926
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:07,390
The moment where they first met.
Before anything went wrong.

1927
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:13,897
Before he didn't show up for
her when she needed him most.

1928
01:27:14,981 --> 01:27:17,066
Before he understood that
being there for somebody

1929
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:20,612
when it's most difficult is really
all that relationships are.

1930
01:27:22,322 --> 01:27:23,823
Jason knew that now.

1931
01:27:25,867 --> 01:27:29,996
And he was so sorry
for what he had done.

1932
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:37,545
But Jason also realized
that in that moment,

1933
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:41,382
he wasn't afraid, because he

1934
01:27:43,635 --> 01:27:45,470
thought she wasn't the one.

1935
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:51,309
He was absolutely terrified,
because he knew she was.

1936
01:27:55,563 --> 01:27:58,900
And if she could give him
just one more chance,

1937
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:03,571
just one more chance,

1938
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:07,909
she knew where to find him.
