00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,567
(MUFFLED SHOUTING) Oh...

173
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,415
Whatever you do,
do not make a sound.

174
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,254
(SCREAMS) Sh...

175
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,194
I'm Jake from the TFF.
That's Turkey Freedom Front.

176
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,698
You've just been recruited
for a top secret mission.

177
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,466
Ah! Help! I'm being kidnapped
by a wild turkey!

178
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,108
Security! Set Tasers to kill!

179
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,265
Ah!

180
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,806
(GRUNTS)
MAN: What was that?

181
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,589
- Oh!
- Love your enthusiasm, comrade.

182
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:24,882
Dah!

183
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,388
But you're running
in the wrong direction.

184
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,550
Besides, we're already
behind schedule.

185
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,219
- We're behind schedule?
- We are?

186
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,388
Why didn't you say so?
Let's move!

187
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,592
REGGIE: Look, I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

188
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,737
I'm not part of any mission.

189
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,602
Horizon seems clear.

190
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,800
- Hold on.
- Hey, wait!

191
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,173
It's me, the pardoned turkey.
Help me!

192
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,009
A strange rogue turkey.
Stay back. I'll take him out.

193
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:52,681
Ah!

194
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,376
- Please don't hurt me.
- I don't know who you are

195
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,851
but you're seriously
jeopardizing this operation.

196
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,456
Are you insane? It's me.

197
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,793
Is it? Is it really?

198
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:02,950
Would you get off me?!

199
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,359
(GRUNTING)

200
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,092
You know what? I'm sick of you
throwing me around.

201
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,133
You see this line?

202
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,669
Do not come into my personal...

203
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,435
Did you not see the line?

204
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,440
'Cause I was pretty clear
that it's right...

205
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,306
Snap out of it, Reggie.

206
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,447
Wait, how do you know my name?

207
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,948
Because he told me
everything about you.

208
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,983
He? Who is he?

209
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,817
The Great Turkey.
He appeared in the sky

210
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:36,553
on a bright ball of light with a voice
that came from everywhere.

211
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,563
He gave me my mission,
told me I needed to find you.

212
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,964
And then, he gave me this.

213
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,898
A door knob?

214
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,134
The sacred time knob.

215
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,208
This guy is a lunatic. Oh!

216
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,713
That secret military base
should be right up ahead.

217
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,408
(GRUNTING)

218
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,076
The facility should be in here.

219
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,917
Just need to figure out how to get
past this impenetrable gate.

220
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,761
So, this is what it looks like
on the inside.

221
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,333
Okay, what's inside
this secret base, anyway?

222
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,937
A time machine.
(THUNDER CRASHES)

223
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,166
A time machine?

224
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,708
A time machine.
(THUNDER CRASHES)

225
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,812
- A time machine.
- A time...

226
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,243
(THUNDER CRASHES, STOPS)
What?! Who told you that?

227
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,906
You did, just now.

228
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,984
Of course I did. I was testing you.

229
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,353
- Uh...
- That's our mission.

230
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,618
Not to save ten turkeys
or even a hundred, but all of them.

231
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,854
We're going back in time
to the first Thanksgiving

232
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,090
to get turkeys off the menu.

233
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,965
That's right,
we're going back in time

234
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:56,632
to the first Thanksgiving
to get turkeys off the menu.

235
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,207
- Who are you talking to?
- This guy right here.

236
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,475
He totally gets it.
Look, look, see how he's nodding?

237
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,584
Hello, soldier, welcome
to the Turkey Freedom Front.

238
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,555
I'm just gonna let you two
get acquainted. Oh!

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,398
Scanning area.
(STRAINED) What are you doing?

240
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,172
- Not binoculars.
- Wait!

241
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,900
- There's our target. Let's go!
- Ah!

Stand back.
Initiating launch sequence.

244

Tingling sensation in lower body.

245
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,427
Blood pressure rising, rapidly...

I can feel time warping!

248
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,802
Ooh! We can warp to another time
and maintain their lawns.

249
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,708
This doesn't make sense.

250
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,109
Oh, oh, look.

251
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,807
Potting soil from the year 3000.

Ooh.

253
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,650
- Oh, Jake, look!
- What? What is it?

254
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,948
Future paint. Secret basecoat.

255
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,194
But, he said it would be here.

256
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,056

I don't know who your friend is

258

but you guys should start
the Idiot Freedom Front

259
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,500
and free yourselves from stupidity.

260
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,370

and there's definitely no time...

I'm not following you!

00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,026
A map! Will it lead us
to the time machine?

Where is it?

It's, uh...

Oh, we follow the blue line.

286
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,644
The blue line, of course!

287
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,978
Of course.
We'll both follow the blue line

288
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,815
and get to the time machine
and stop Thanksgiving.

Yes, sir!

Huh, I just want to go back
to being a pardoned turkey.

like to go, Jake?</i>

1372
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:31,502
Wherever we are needed, S.T.E.V.E..
Wherever we are needed.

1373
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:39,104
So, is this turkey paradise?

1374
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,180
Oh!
(KISSING)

1375
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:47,314
(SIGHS) Wow, you're moving pretty fast
for a Pisces.

1376
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:48,786
Whatever that is.

1377
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:51,050
(BLOWS NOSE)

1378
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,250
(BOTH LAUGH)

1379
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,950
S.T.E.V.E.: <i>Oh, my.</i>

1380
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,266
(♪ SOCIAL DISTORTION: "UP AROUND THE BEND")

1381
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:30,215
(WHIRRING, BOOM) Whoa!

1382
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:36,120
Jake, what happened?
You were only gone like a second!

1383
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,992
I've actually been gone for years.

1384
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,828
Have you heard about the turducken?!

1385
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,902
(CLUCKS)
(QUACKS)

1386
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:50,904
("UP AROUND THE BEND"
CONTINUES)
