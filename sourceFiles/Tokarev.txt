00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,161
Hi, Sweetheart.

3
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,281
Hey, Daddy.

4
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,041
You know, you don't have
to pick me up, I can find a ride.

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,043
Yeah, I know, that's what worries me.

6
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,090
What is that on the back
of your hand, Caitlin Maguire?

7
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,846
Relax, Dad, it's henna, okay?

8
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,567
Padma's mom did it for the girls in class,
we're studying Indian culture.

9
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,326
Indian Culture,
it washes-off, right?

10
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,722
Sort of, it will wear off.

11
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,250
I got these, the girl at the store
said they were the best ones.

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,162
Jeez, thank you, Dad.

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,602
You know, I don't...
I don't take the SAT's until next year.

14
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,366
It's never too early to start preparing, right?

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,963
Oh, hey, can we stop
at the store for a couple of snacks?

16
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,209
The boys are coming over after Mikey gets off work.

17
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,129
So, Mikey has a job, huh?

18
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,084
Yeah, not everyone at my school
is a rich snob, Dad.

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,364
Mikey's on scholarship and
he washes dishes at Denny's.

20
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,570
Have you finished with your term paper?

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,004
- Totally.
- Totally.

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,842
All right, it's almost done,
I just have to proof it and print it.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,129
I want that paper done before
your two little buddies come over,

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,645
otherwise you'll never finish.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,610
Alea est iacta.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,449
What?

27
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,444
The die is cast.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,402
It's from "Julius Caesar", you know that thing
I've been working on for the past six weeks.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,684
The die is cast.

30
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,850
It's impressive.

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,731
You got the date locked?

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,966
Next Saturday,

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,043
Caitlin's gonna love it,
the band's booked.

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,404
- She's got the whole place to herself.
- Good.

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,600
Caitlin's Sweet Sixteen,
damn, makes me feel old!

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,206
What are we gonna do with the... those?

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,441
Don't worry about it,

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,490
I'll tell the bartenders
and waitresses, "No booze".

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,521
Not a drop,

40
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:14,443
<i>Oh, okay.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,729
Did you talk to the doorman,
"no meth at the door"?

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,366
- Your doormen sell meth?
- Don't worry about it.

43
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,850
If I hear of anyone even
looking at Caitlin's friends funny,

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,490
I'll kick their asses myself.

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,711
No, no, no, wait a minute,

46
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,966
these are sixteen year-old kids.
Kane, I don't want any incidents.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,161
We're not sixteen year-olds, drinkin and doing drugs,

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,850
like we're role models.

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,069
How much trouble did we used to
get into when we were their age?

50
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,620
You know, I seem to remember
you double-dipping Betsy,

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,066
the one with those wavy eyes.

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,178
That's right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

53
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:49,080
Wasn't she your girl for a while?

54
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,765
She was for a while until I found-out that
this bad-ass was knocking his bot dong around.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,731
Well, hey, we shared the same honey-pot, right?

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,505
- It makes us milk-brothers.
- Romulus and Remus.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,564
Well, this is what I don't understand,

58
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,755
how would you remember who you bang,

59
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,931
I mean, you've been drinking a fifth
of Scotch a day since you were born?

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,401
About a bad-ass, mean-ass man you was.

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,965
I'm gonna throw a great party,
you're a great dad.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,886
I gotta run.

63
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,770
Take it easy, Paulie.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,688
Oh, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!

65
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,802
Can you please tell us how many
jobs will be provided on this project?

66
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,931
Yes... Phase One has already
created more than a hundred jobs,

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,770
local jobs, for this community.

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,167
And today we begin Phase Two.

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,489
And Phase Two means that we'll have a park,

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,246
- as well as a river-walk.
- Mr. Maguire!

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,249
What do you intend to do with the profits?

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,327
Thank you, Frank.

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,721
The Mayor and I feel that this project will

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,286
certainly stimulate the economy and

75
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,241
we intend to put the money back into
education and medical, thank you.

76
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,771
Thank you all for coming.

77
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,794
Hey, are you almost ready? We're gonna be late
for dinner with the Thompsons and Dean White.

78
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,368
What does Dean White do exactly?

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,445
He works for the governor.

80
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,608
I think he's gonna run for State Controller.

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,886
Good guy to know.

82
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,563
We're gonna need a few extra contacts.
Do you prefer the Noir tonight, or the Portofino?

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,689
Noir.

84
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,764
You know Princeton's nearly 40,000 a year
and that's not including room and board?

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,687
I know, can we swing it?

86
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,966
I got it covered.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,002
WE'VE got it covered.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,645
We're a team here, right?

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,450
Yes, we are a team, but...

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,321
No, no buts!
None of this "She's my daughter" bullshit, all right?

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,367
I love the two of you, and I'm here
for you both, you got it?

92
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,767
You know, you're very sexy
when you put me in my place.

93
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,929
Is this you changing the subject?

94
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,162
I don't think we have time for this.

95
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,682
You are SUCH a tease.

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,122
I'm not gonna shit on no hellion.

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,847
Caitlin, your gonna be
staying home tonight, right?

98
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,448
Yeah, we just hanging-out here.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,570
Good, because you have a lot of homework
that needs to be done by Monday,

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,882
- and you need to focus on your work.
- Okay, Dad.

I'm serious.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,891
Dad, I know.
Listen, we're just gonna hang-out here,

104
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,565
watch TV or something.

105
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,802
Lisa might stop by,
but that is it.

106
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,370
Michael, I hear you're a working man.

107
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,761
- Yes, sir.
- And how's that working out for you?

108
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,482
It sucks.

109
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,564
But it's nice for a buck or two,
and it's pretty flexible, you know?

110
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,081
This summer if you wanna make
some real money, you let me know,

111
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,083
I can put you on one of my crews.

112
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,449
Swinging a hammer pays a hell of a lot
more than working at Denny's.

113
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,431
You'd do that for me?

114
00:06:57,493 --> 00:07:00,245
Yeah, if you give me a hand with
one of these boxes over here.

115
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,482
Okay.

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,606
- This?
- Yeah.

117
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,642
So, you gonna ask my daughter out?

118
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,523
What?

119
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,848
I see the way you're lookin' at her.

120
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,088
I didn't think you'd
let her go out, you know?

121
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,442
- You smoke weed?
- No.

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,161
- No drugs at all?
- No.

123
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,524
Well, then, I... I might....

124
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,490
be willing to make an exception.

125
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,042
Do you think she'd say, "Yes"?

126
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,481
The mind of a woman is a mysterious thing.

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,246
I can't tell you
what she'll say, but...

128
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,767
"Fortune favors the bold."

129
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,961
You ready?

130
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,289
Yeah, I'm almost there, go start
the car, I'll be right there,

131
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,339
Caitlin, I 'm not your mother,

132
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,809
I'm not going to lecture you about smoking,

133
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,313
although you shouldn't be smoking,

134
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,161
but the last time you and your friends hung-out,

135
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,636
Paul found cigarette butts in the back yard

136
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,605
- and I took the heat for it.
- He believe you?

137
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,082
Probably not, but that's not the point.

138
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,687
- The look he gave me...
- I know the look.

139
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,602
- So, you understand?
- Yeah.

140
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,288
Yeah, Vanessa, I'll be good, I promise.

141
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,051
Thank you.
You guys have a good night.

142
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,766
She's so hot.

143
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,722
Dickhead!

144
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,885
I think the dock area is the perfect place to build,

145
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,243
that part of town is just screaming for re-development.

146
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,930
Uh-huh,  I heard you got a lot going on in re-development.

147
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,647
How'd you get started in the business, Mr. Maguire?

148
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,401
Oh, it's getting late, it's already past midnight.

149
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,360
I'm sure everybody'd like
to go home and get some rest.

150
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,529
Paul doesn't like to brag,

151
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,763
but the truth of the matter is
he built his first development himself.

152
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,091
- A lot of hard work.
- That's what I've heard.

153
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,681
Well, I had a full crew with me, but yeah...

154
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,353
my first job was swinging a hammer,

155
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,691
tends to drive my foremen all crazy, but,

156
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,846
there's nothing that satisfies like a...
an honest day's work.

157
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,388
Love a guy that's not afraid to roll
his sleeves up and get his hands dirty.

158
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:32,007
Here's to an honest day's work!

159
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,245
To an honest day's work!

160
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,281
They're coming to get you, Barbara!

161
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,282
Stop it!

162
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,691
Hey, my dad kinda likes you.

163
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,320
It's funny.

164
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,082
Yeah, Mike go work for The Big Guy,
get in with the family,

165
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,561
next thing ya know, you're marryin' Caitlin,

166
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,724
takin' over the business,
you'll be a made man in no time.

167
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,405
Cut it out, man!

168
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,087
Detective, you here for dinner?

169
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,846
- Paul, we need to talk.
- What seems to be the problem?

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,527
- I'm sorry, but it's urgent.
- This is not the time or the place.

171
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,604
Whatever this is, surely we can
discuss it in the morning.

172
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,247
Paul, listen to me,
this is not about you.

173
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,726
It's about Caitlin.

174
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,687
They called it in about an hour ago,

175
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,763
Michael and that other boy, Evan,

176
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,526
they sent him to the hospital
and got him a sedative.

177
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,684
He was really shaken-up.
What this Michael kid told us

178
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,248
was that all three of them
were together when it happened.

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,917
They were playing video games,
had a few drinks.

180
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,084
He said that Caitlin tried to get away.

181
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,601
They say that she put up a helluva fight.

182
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,285
This can't be happening.

183
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,555
Wha... wha... what about the neighbors,
did they see anything?

184
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,722
No, nothing.

185
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,406
I mean, who would break
into your house, grab your daughter,

186
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,722
there's no ransom demands, nothing.

187
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,808
I don't know, I don't have a problem
with anyone right now.

188
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,810
Right now, but think
about your past.

189
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,645
Who would have the inclination to do this?

190
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,723
I know you still talk to O'Connell.

191
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,410
This is my daughter!

192
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,169
I would tell you if I had
any idea who was behind this.

193
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,248
Would you?

194
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,402
Pete, I 'm out of the game, you know that!

195
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,643
- How long have we known each other?
- Since the massacre at the Four P's...

196
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,644
- Yes, fifteen years, Pete.
- Yeah, I know you.

197
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,245
Right! You do, you know me.

198
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,609
I just don't want you fallin' back
on any of the old habits.

199
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,329
Let us handle this our way,
all right, Paul?

200
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,245
Okay, fine, what's your way?

9998
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:03,502
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

201
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,496
Well, we drop it on the News right away.

202
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,442
Within, if it sits on your history.

203
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,041
How many times do we
have to tell you, that he's clean?

204
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,488
One of two things is going-down here,

205
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,560
the kidnappers either know you or they don't.

206
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,447
If they don't, then the fear of who
they're messin' with is our best asset.

207
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,793
Once they hear, they'll probably drop
her off at a gas station somewhere

208
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:26,087
and she's back by lunch tomorrow.

209
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,520
And if they know me?

210
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,407
They'll be in contact,
and we'll be there.

211
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,768
We have a top on your phone.

212
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,568
Either myself or Detective
Hansen will be here at all times.

213
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,602
Paul, we'll find her.

214
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,681
You better.

215
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,961
Why, Paul?

216
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,086
Why Caitlin?

217
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,924
- You didn't...?
- You, too?

218
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,082
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,099
- I just...
- If I had any idea

220
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,961
who did this...

221
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,528
just one...

222
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,011
You find her.

223
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,725
Do what you have to do.

224
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,247
Whatever it takes,
you just bring her home.

225
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,160
Two unidentified male classmates
were injured in that home invasion

226
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,521
they're expected to make a full recovery.

227
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,624
Caitlin Maguire is five-six, one hundred and five pounds,

228
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,928
with long brown hair and blue eyes.

229
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,270
If you have any information
that could help in the investigation

230
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,403
and search for Caitlin...

231
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,445
Move! Let's go!

232
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,769
Go, go, Danny, go!

233
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,968
- I'm gonna go out.
- Go out?

234
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,493
I can't just sit here,

235
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,001
waiting for the phone to ring, knowing
she's out there somewhere, scared.

236
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,527
And I'm supposed to
stay here all by myself?

237
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,728
There's cops all over the house.

238
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,445
That's not what I meant.

239
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,728
Please.

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,331
Be safe, okay?

241
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,200
Where are we off to?

242
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,249
Hey!

243
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,903
It'd be best if you just stay here by the phone.

244
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,937
Shouldn't you be out somewhere
looking for my daughter?

245
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,047
- We're doin' everything we can.
- So am I.

246
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,849
Paul!

247
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,286
I'm so sorry,

248
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,450
Eleanor, please, I need to speak with your son.

249
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,203
Wow!

250
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,410
You got all these awards.

251
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,290
You know, I started dating Mary when I was seventeen.

252
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,847
That was Caitlin's mom, Mary.
Your seventeen, right?

253
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:25,464
Yeah.

254
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,404
I remember once we were
on this date down by the shore...

255
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,165
summertime,

256
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,771
hot as shit, just wouldn't cool off.

257
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,805
Anyway, this Puerto Rican looking shithead
comes walking down the beach, and

258
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,843
calls Mary a slut.

259
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,646
You believe that shit?

260
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,644
Calling a nice, Irish, Catholic girl
like that a slut, well...

261
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,366
needless to say, I had to defend her honor,

262
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,283
because that's what gentlemen do,
they protect women.

263
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,638
So I went and I got the tire iron out of the trunk
of my car and I broke both of his legs.

264
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,803
I'm not like that anymore.

265
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,489
No, I've changed,

266
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,803
See, 'cause when Mary got sick...

267
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,082
stage four breast cancer...

268
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,254
swore I'd go legit, so there'd
always be at least one...

269
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:30,569
one parent around to
take care of Caitlin.

270
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,890
They each had guns!

271
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,961
I would expect you to get SHOT...
trying to protect her.

272
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,208
Now, I want you to think hard,

273
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,685
what did they sound like?

274
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,523
What?

275
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,771
The kidnappers,
did they have an accent?

276
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,604
Did they sound Russian?

277
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,571
Puerto Rican?

278
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,884
Did they use any words? Slang?
Did they sound like greenbahs?

279
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,250
I... I don't know.

280
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,450
Wha... what did they smell like?
Spicy food, too much cologne?

281
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,316
Come on, Mike,
you have to give me something.

282
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,703
if anything happens to my daughter,

283
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,690
- I'm holding you personally responsible.
- I don't know, I'm sorry, I don't know!

284
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,210
It was all so fast, I messed up, ya know.

285
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,725
I wish I coulda done something,
I wish I'd been braver.

286
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,248
I wish it was me, okay?

287
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,885
If you remember anything,
you give me a call, you got it?

288
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,840
Yes, sir.

289
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,764
Yeah, it's me, I need some help,
will you meet me at the construction site?

290
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,805
We're sorry,

291
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,927
We'll find this roach who did this, Paulie.

292
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,170
You got my word on it.

293
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,047
I know you're still in with O'Connell, right?

294
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,721
- Yep.
- Right.

295
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,602
You remember that stink that Golden syphed not too long ago?

296
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,246
Did my time, kept my mouth shut, roughed me up.

297
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,008
I need guys I can trust.

298
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,123
The cops are keeping
very close tabs on me, so...

299
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,245
I... I understand if you don't
want to get involved with this, but I...

300
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,691
I do need some help.

9999
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:57,002
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

301
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,651
Say the word.

302
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,406
I want to find her.

303
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,891
- I want to find who took her, and...
- They're dead, Paulie.

304
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,607
They just don't know it yet, right?

305
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,610
There's two hundred thousand.

306
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,606
Use what you need to get any information,
just keep the rest, okay?

307
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,245
We really can't take that.

308
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,406
We're family.

309
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,287
You'd do the same thing for us, Paulie.

310
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,527
- We'll do anything you ask.
- I know.

311
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,926
This could get dirty,
so, just how deep do you want this to go?

312
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,405
How deep is hell?

313
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,530
I know just where to look.

314
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,486
The guy's a rat but he knows me.

315
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,485
Just hang back and follow my lead, all right?

316
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,326
Jesus, an elevator woulda been nice.

317
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,890
Knock, knock, asshole!

318
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,225
Oh, shit!

319
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,286
No, no, no, no!
I didn't steal anything, man!

320
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,846
I swear! You know I wouldn't
mess with you guys! C'mon!

321
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,892
Relax, relax, I know you wouldn't do that,
all right, you're too smart for that.

322
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,007
I got one question to ask you, all right?

323
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,242
Who kidnapped Paul Maguire's daughter?

324
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,271
Take a good look,
you heard anything?

325
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,680
Nothing! I swear!
If I knew, I would tell you! C’mon!

326
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,649
Now, who would mess with Maguire anyway?

327
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,522
My, my, my.

328
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm not happy with what I see here, Oliver.

329
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,761
I'll bet you were a sweet little BL, huh,
before he got you all jacked-up?

330
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,240
Come here, honey, come here honey.

331
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,730
That's it, easy now.

332
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,563
Put her down, put her down.

333
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,371
- What are you doing?
- Come on, my Little Princess.

334
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,931
Am I your Little Princess?

335
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,962
I got a pretty little
Princess Necklace here for you, too.

336
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,607
You don't know anything about the girl, huh, Oliver?

337
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,764
- Nothing, I swear!
- Start talking, Oliver!

338
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,962
Please! Please! Look! Whatever it is you about to do...
don't, please, don't, no.

339
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,884
Tell me about the girl, Oliver.

340
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,408
Please, if I knew, I would tell you.
C'mon, don't hurt her, c'mon, man.

341
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,844
Please don't, don't.
No, no! Don't Doherty!

342
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,961
Listen to me,

343
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,086
If there a girl being held somewhere?

344
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,887
I don't know, I don't know!. No idea!
Just tell him! I don't know!

345
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
- No, no, no, no!
- Talk to me, Oliver!

346
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,409
No, please! Don't!

347
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,411
- I love her, no, I don't know!
- What's that?

348
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,325
I love her, man!

349
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,211
No, no, no, no!
Lisa, come here.

350
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,242
I need you to breathe.

351
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,563
Now I believe you.
See you around, Oliver

352
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,641
Jesus, I can't believe I hit that rope.

353
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,524
What, you've never done that shit before?

354
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,770
Hell no, I thought she was going
for a two-story swan dive.

355
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,288
- You're one harmful guy.
- Right, right, you're a saint, huh?

356
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,886
- Nobody's seen or heard anything.
- How is that possible?

357
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,051
Paul, we've been rattling jaws all night long.

358
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,501
Whoever took her, is keeping their shit tight.

359
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,364
Got feelers out everywhere.

360
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,921
Somewhere, someone... has to mess-up.

361
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,528
Right.

362
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,522
Paul,

363
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,885
We found her.

364
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,761
Thank you for your beautiful soul.

365
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm sorry.

366
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,962
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you for coming,

367
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,043
I'm so sorry, my friend,

368
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,967
- Vanessa, this is Francis...
- Francis O'Connell.

369
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,929
Hi, I 'm Vanessa, I'm Paul's wife.

370
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,376
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Frank.

371
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,364
If you don't mind, Frank, I have a...

372
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,602
some things I'd like to attend to at the house.

373
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,085
I'll see you later.

374
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,244
Can we take a walk?

375
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,764
You've done really good for yourself, Paulie.

376
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,885
I 'm proud of you.

377
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,728
Smoke and mirrors, Francis.

378
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,044
That's not what I heard.

379
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,929
You got a nice, big house over
there by the Country Club, eh?

380
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,049
And a beautiful wife.

381
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,328
You know, Paul, the present situation aside,

382
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,400
you got yourself one helluva life,
don't you agree? Huh?

383
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,410
Is this going somewhere?

384
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,282
Things have settled down,

385
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,364
and the business is more civilized
than it used to be.

386
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,003
In the good old days, you remember,
the gutters were running red. Huh?

387
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,169
You remember that night at the Four Ps,

388
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,686
and what those Russians faggots did to me?

389
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,487
Of course.

390
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,174
But do you remember what I told you

391
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,361
because you wanted to rush-in and kill 'em all?

392
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,883
- You said we lost too many already.
- Exactly.

393
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,922
I don't know what this has to do with anything.

394
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,167
My neck, it's hurtin' to look up to you like this.

395
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,522
Do you mind sitting down?

396
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,123
That's better.
Eye to eye.

397
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,883
That's the thing I miss the most, I guess,

398
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,370
to be able to stand over
somebody and stare 'em down.

399
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,045
Those simple, small things in life
that I'm not able to do anymore.

400
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,791
You know, like bangin' a young broad, or

401
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,361
kicking somebody's teeth down their throat.

402
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,491
But do I lash out, Paulie?

403
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,566
Do I show my weakness? No.

404
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,490
I bury it a long time ago.

405
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,729
I buried the hurt.

406
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,207
Just like you have to bury yours.

407
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,486
Hey, I'm not finished!
Sit down!

408
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,481
Um-huh.

409
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,843
Yeah, you better be listening.

410
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,850
Because I know you,

411
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,001
and know this unpleasantness is eating at you,

412
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,283
and you're determined to do something about it.

413
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,841
I'm asking you, don't.

414
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,451
Let the cops do their jobs, huh?

415
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,607
Things are good,
I want 'em to stay that way.

416
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,128
Right?

417
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,407
Things don't look so good from where I am, Francis.

418
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,402
If you won't listen to reason,
can you listen to a friend.

419
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,169
I did you a big favor when I let you walk out.

420
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,210
I didn't have to,
you know that, but I did.

421
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,882
I let you walk out.

422
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,339
It's not every day someone can just
walk out of the business, clean, as you could.

423
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,607
But you could,
you know why?

424
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,126
Because you came to me and you asked me.

425
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,626
I did you a favor
and now I want

426
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,367
you to repay me by doing nothing.

427
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,361
Let it go away, Paulie,
bury the hurt.

428
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,931
You understand me.

429
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,123
Yeah.

430
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,931
I understand.

431
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,006
Does anyone want cream?

432
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,004
No thanks, I'm good.

433
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,522
Your friend Sheila still come around?

434
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,971
I don't know what we're gonna do with all the food.

435
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,208
So...

436
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,730
Honey, do you mind?

437
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,720
I want to know.

438
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,602
No, really, you don't.

439
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,043
Hey.

440
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,203
- She's a peach, that wife of yours.
- So, what's the word?

441
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,207
No word.

442
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,764
O'Connell not only said to stay out of it,
but to keep an eye on you, too.

443
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,926
So what now?

444
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,086
I still have someone inside the Force,
someone who won't report back to your boss.

445
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,368
I do.

446
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,282
I can have him check into the case.

447
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,246
I didn't want to bring this up, because...

448
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,594
we're not supposed to bring it up, we...

449
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,684
No, it was a long time ago,
we did everything right.

450
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,606
Are you sure?

451
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,627
- Go, go, Danny, go!
- Go, go!

452
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,508
- Where is the key?
- Where is it?

453
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,206
- I ain't got it.!
- Where is it, asshole?

454
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,442
- No! No! No!
- Give me his gun.

455
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,161
Shit, no, no, no, no!

456
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,721
It's your nasty, clean it up!

457
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,241
No, we... we did everything right.

458
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,521
Jesus!

459
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,969
Tell me about it.

460
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,006
How is it that a man with this
many past criminal associations

461
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,121
can turn legitimate businessman
and I can't get a re-file on my mortgage?

462
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,806
I mean, look at this!
Irish mob, Russian mob.

463
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,327
Twenty suspects, no leads.

464
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,850
When have you ever known
a criminal to just go clean?

465
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,321
No arrest doesn't mean no activity.

466
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,445
Maybe he's just been careful.

467
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,770
No, I just talked with him
a few days ago, he's a wreck.

468
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,642
If he was still dirty,
he'd know who did this.

469
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,327
This ought to narrow-down the suspect list.

470
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,047
It's the ballistics on the Maguire girl.

471
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,001
A 7.62 millimeter, fired from
a Soviet made Tokarev TT-33.

472
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,286
Well, it gets worse.

473
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,370
It crossed against three hits
tied to the Chernov family.

474
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,724
One in 1983, and two in 1988.

475
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,844
What does that tell you?

476
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,971
That whoever killed her,

477
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:12,240
hadn't killed anyone for a long, damn time.

478
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,568
At least not with that gun.

479
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,568
This stays here.

480
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,641
Mr. Maguire.

481
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,091
I'm really very sorry for your loss.

482
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,487
Caitlin was... she was really something else.

483
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,886
Yes, she was.

484
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,969
She worked really hard on that,
and I just thought that...

485
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
Of course, I'll read it tonight.

486
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,121
Mr. Maguire,

487
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,364
Would you like to collect Caitlin's
belongings from her locker?

488
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,809
Are you sure it's Chernov?

489
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,405
No, I'm not sure.

490
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,366
But whoever did it used a Russian gun.

491
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,330
It was 20 years ago,
how could they know about us?

492
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,568
How?

493
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,170
They took his daughter,
and you think that's coincidence.

494
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,165
Yeah, well, I never talked.

495
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,365
And you never talked.

496
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,567
And I'm certain Paul never talked.

497
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,689
So, how would anybody know?

498
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,129
This whole mess just stinks,

499
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,250
Do you want me to tell him?

500
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,811
No, I'll tell him.

501
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,531
- Hey.
- Hi.

502
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,561
Is he in?

503
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,645
Maybe he'll talk to you.

504
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,406
Are you okay?

505
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,449
Fine.

506
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,011
I know it's hard.

507
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,000
Just because she wasn't my blood,

508
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,124
doesn't mean she wasn't
my daughter, you know.

509
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,561
She loved you,

510
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,282
Thank you.

511
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,241
Stay strong.

512
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,606
He's upstairs.

513
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,683
Hey.

514
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,965
It was when she was four.

515
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,450
What have you heard?

516
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,048
- Ballistics.
- Yes?

517
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,885
Wanna get out of here?

518
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,762
So, what does that mean exactly?

519
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,995
How's someone like you get as far in
your organization without knowing his guns?

520
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,921
Knives are quiet,
I like knives.

521
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,771
Tokarev.
TT-33.

522
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,605
It's an old army sidearm,
HL clip.

523
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,313
And it's favored in the Russian mafia.

524
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:41,732
Jesus.

525
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,244
Yeah, the Russians.
Coulda been a hit.

526
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,149
It coulda been a smaller faction
just lookin' for some ransom money.

527
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,370
Not one of 'em takes a shit
without Chernov's permission.

528
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,529
We never asked permission to rob the Russians.

529
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,205
We don't talk about that.

530
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,390
I keep trying to get Vanessa to stay
someplace safe, but she won't listen.

531
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,886
- She won't go.
- So, what do you wanna do?

532
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,001
Call Danny.

533
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,528
Like old times, fellas.

534
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,211
Let's do this, huh?

535
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,233
You're not understanding,

536
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,368
as we have a lot of money to spend
and we want to play some cards.

537
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,929
Clearly you have a problem
understanding English, we want to play cards.

538
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:58,844
- We want to play cards.
- Nyet! Private!

539
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,361
No, no, that is NOT what I said,
what I said is

540
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,763
we have a lot of money to spend
and we want to play some cards.

541
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,886
Okay, let us in.

542
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,083
Private.

543
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,331
Rivet?

544
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,484
Hey, hey, hey!
We need you to move, pardner!

545
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,644
Speak English!

546
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,561
I speak three languages.

547
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,971
How many you speak?
Stupid Americans?

548
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,889
That got their attention.

549
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,764
- They're gonna come gunnin' for us.
- No shit!

550
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,727
Always the best way to get information
when it's hard to come by.

551
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,443
You stir the pot,
they'll come lookin' for you.

552
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,365
- Just be ready.
- We're ready.

553
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,646
Now, Danny, this shit's about to get radical,
you gotta cover each other.

554
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,282
- Relax! All right, we got this.
- Not one of your cocaine parties.

555
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,171
Really? You gotta go there, Paulie?

556
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,081
What is it with you and my partying anyway, huh?

557
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,681
All right, let's just relax, okay?

558
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,603
All right?

559
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,086
Jesus, Paulie.

560
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,045
- What is this?
- You know exactly what this is.

561
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,403
It is not safe for you to be here anymore.

562
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,721
Tell me what happened?

563
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,684
Please don't shut me out,
I want to know.

564
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,742
What? What would you really want to know? Huh?

565
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,685
What do you want to know? You
want to know how many people

566
00:45:35,786 --> 00:45:38,131
I jacked-up last night,
how loud the screams were?

567
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,284
- No, I...
- Then what!?

568
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,486
Is it over?

569
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,604
It 's just beginning,

570
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,427
What do you think?
I need you, you need me.

571
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,329
You told me to do whatever it takes, right?

572
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,722
Well, this is what it takes,
pack your bags.

573
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,565
Nothing was wrong, maybe I should've
kept my mouth shut.

574
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,006
But you didn't.

575
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,844
Now I'm in this.

576
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,003
I'm sorry if it upsets you.

577
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,085
Yeah, that upsets me.

578
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,529
My husband is a killer.

579
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,083
I think you're enjoying this.

580
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,787
Say, "My husband's a killer."

581
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,764
Come on, repeat after me,
"My husband is a killer."

582
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,465
You've always known it,
you just haven't seen it until now.

583
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,689
Huh? Is that what's going on? Is that why
you're still here? 'Cause it turns you on?

584
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,404
- Anything?
- Nothin'.

585
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,521
All right, we up the stakes.

586
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,845
What are you thinkin'?

587
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,045
We need a vory.

588
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,284
Let me make a quick call.

589
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,247
Beautiful.

590
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,601
Yeah, just take him into the back room,
keep him occupied for us, sweetheart.

591
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,041
We'll be right over.

592
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,448
Yeah, me too, easy now.

593
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,631
Amber's got a vory over at the Club,

594
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,002
she's gonna take him to the back room for us.

595
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,922
Just in case the bot can.

596
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,884
All right, all three of us go in here,
it's gonna look suspicious as hell.

597
00:48:01,919 --> 00:48:05,043
All right, so, you two sit tight,
and I'll go in and get this prick out.

598
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,400
I got this.

599
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,568
I shoot people in the street.

600
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,006
Do you know who I am?

601
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,042
- What? You are nothing to me.
- Hey!

602
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,107
Do you know me? Huh?

603
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,170
Nineteen years ago I threw you from a car,

604
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,085
and stole your boss' money,
do you remember that?

605
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,961
In the mask.

606
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,681
Chernov thought I took the money.

607
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,771
He tortured me, you're too late.

608
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,125
I lost these fingers because of you.

609
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,369
Someone put a bullet in my daughter's head,

610
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,083
with a Russian handgun.

611
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,126
Who did it?

612
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,725
Was that Chernov?

613
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,600
Someone had to have a turn?
Who was it?

614
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,402
Who did it?

615
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,077
Who did it?

616
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,491
No, no, no, no! Don't die.
No, no! Don't die!

617
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,759
Who did it? Who did it?
Who did it?

618
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,207
Who did it? Who did it?
Who did it? Who did it?

619
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,690
A cup of coffee, please.

620
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,682
Thank you.

621
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,528
I 'm here, what do you want?

622
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,286
You can't go around tearing-up the city,
this isn't good for anyone.

623
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,489
Don't know what you're talkin' about.

624
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,205
Look, man,

625
00:53:28,014 --> 00:53:29,680
this isn't gonna bring your kid back.

626
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,726
I feel you, what you're goin' through.

627
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,163
But if this keeps up,

628
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,842
I promise you I'm gonna find a way
to put you and your crew away for good.

629
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,729
Shit, Paul!

630
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,204
A few years ago,
my kid, Robbie,

631
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:55,126
was ridin' his bike on 6th Street,
got hit by a car.

632
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,000
I get to emergency and it's touch and go.

633
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,129
Yeah.

634
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,763
The poor kid is..
is in surgery.

635
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,964
I felt I needed to do something, anything.

636
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,362
Found out where the guy lived.

637
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,408
I see his fender, mangled,

638
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,244
where he hit my boy.

639
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,729
I must've stood an hour
at the edge of that driveway,

640
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,890
with the gun in my hand.

641
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,331
Then, finally I cooled myself down
and I go back to the hospital,

642
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,488
Robbie pulls through.

643
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,795
A few days later, I went down to 6th Street,

644
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,084
there was construction going on,

645
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,325
there was a blind spot.

646
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,446
And I realized, in that moment,

647
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,846
that that accident coulda happened to anyone.

648
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,648
If I had killed that man,

649
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,163
it wouldn't've changed a thing.

650
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,325
Your kid is still alive.

651
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,206
Anything else?

652
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,724
C'mon, bitch!

653
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,569
You!

654
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,081
Put you weapon down, on the floor now!

655
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,048
Down!

656
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,368
All right!

657
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,091
Andrei!

658
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,891
Andrei!

659
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,771
Andrei!

660
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,319
It's okay, you'll be dead soon.

661
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,446
But first...

662
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,531
you're gonna talk.

663
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,883
Somebody put one helluva dent in Chernov's drug operation.

664
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,621
Yeah, and I haven't even started thinkin'
about the mess at the Russian joint.

665
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,278
Six skull cross, Chernov's men, huh?

666
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,682
Meet Sasha Barad.

667
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,049
Rap sheet as long as my dick.

668
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,160
Cutting-off fingers.

669
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,442
Somebody's trying to sniff-out a secret.

670
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,728
I have a pretty good idea who.

671
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,561
What's is it?

672
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,486
Someone went into our house,
Victor and Sasha are dead

673
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,530
Find whoever did this.

674
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,769
And bring them directly to me.

675
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,928
What's this world comin' to, huh?

676
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,209
When I was a young man, we used to
settle our disputes with this.

677
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,042
Words were exchanged,
before gun shots.

678
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,184
People KNEW what was coming to them...
and why.

679
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,886
These days, they shoot first.

680
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,727
There's no rationale, no protocol,

681
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,928
nothing but blood and confusion.

682
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,040
How are we supposed to know
what these men want?

683
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,082
Oh, shit!

684
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,403
Hello?

685
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,886
There should be almost three,
big bunch of Russian guys had just gotten out.

686
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,565
How long will it take you and Doherty to get over?

687
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,730
- I thought he was with you.
- No, man, he's not with me.

688
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,726
Just make it fast.

689
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,730
<i>...hang-up and try...

690
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,408
Come on!

691
01:03:57,381 --> 01:03:59,806
God damn it, Danny, take it off, they got Kane!

692
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:01,803
Danny!

693
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,847
Go, go, go!

694
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,842
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Me!? What the hell is wrong with you?

695
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,724
- Cuff him!
- Come on!

696
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,408
Get off him!

697
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:36,497
<i>Get off!

698
01:06:36,811 --> 01:06:39,561
Are you tryin' to kill everyone
in this city? Look at me!

699
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,807
Go to hell!

700
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,220
What the hell's goin' on, Maguire?

701
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,602
This asshole let the kidnappers get away.

702
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,570
I'd like to ask you a few questions
concerning your whereabouts last night.

703
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,007
I'm trying to help you here,
you got clean once,

704
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,281
do it again.

705
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,849
Walk away, let us do OUR job.

706
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,811
We'll find who killed your daughter,
I promise you, Paul.

707
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:03,851
- It's a top priority.
- Bullshit.

708
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,209
I knew you heard about the ballistic report.

709
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,604
Personally, a couple of dead vory brightens my day.

710
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,205
So, why are they after you?

711
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,003
What did you do?
Did you piss someone off?

712
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,761
Can I go now?

713
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,165
Sir, are you serious?

714
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,687
- I'll take care of this.
- You gonna let him walk?

715
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,446
Thanks, Peter,
I owe you one.

716
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,688
Hey, Paul.

717
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,285
Watch your back, man.

718
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,161
Mr. Kane, you know, who I am, right?

719
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,762
Not personally, no.
We've never met.

720
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,644
Your name is Chernov,
and you're the bad guy.

721
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,525
That is quite funny,

722
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,331
coming from someone who's responsible
for the death of several of my men.

723
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,605
Can you offer me an explanation
for your behavior, please.

724
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,560
Explanation, I should be asking you the same thing.

725
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,161
Anton, please,
allow me to handle this.

726
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,524
Maybe a little water will help loosen your belt up.

727
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,806
Drink up.

728
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,567
There.

729
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,848
That'll not explain things.

730
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,724
Others don't explain.

731
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,765
I ask questions,

732
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,124
you answer them, understand?

733
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,127
That's sexy, I like that.

734
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,767
- I taught you to do that.
- Tell the stripper to leave, Danny.

735
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,685
- Paulie, what's up, buddy?
- Where were you, Danny?

736
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,002
Get out, grab your stuff, get out.

737
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,602
What's up?

738
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,725
You didn't check your phone?

739
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,720
I was just blowing-off a little steam with Amber.

740
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,965
Why aren't you at your house?

741
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,767
'Cause you don't bang strippers in your home.
What's going on?

742
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,647
- They got Kane.
- Oh, Jesus.

743
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,323
And you didn't answer your phone.

744
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,721
I told you, I was havin' fun, I...

745
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,041
All this action, I couldn't wind-down,
I needed a release.

746
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,842
While you were gettn' high,
and getting your dick wet,

747
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,729
they got Kane.

748
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,285
Paulie, let me get you a drink, all right?

749
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,450
How's the old bladder feeling?

750
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:47,967
Is it full?

751
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,770
Why are you killing my men?

752
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,242
Why would you be so stupid, huh?

753
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,921
What could you possibly have to gain.

754
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,961
I can do it much longer than you can.

755
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,366
- Caitlin Maguire.
- Who?

756
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,602
You killed Caitlin Maguire,
Paul Maguire's daughter, that's the truth.

757
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,806
The former criminal,
who lost his daughter?

758
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,881
- He thinks I did it?
- He knows you did it.

759
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,251
That is a terrible accusation.

760
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,641
Why would I kill the little girl?

761
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,563
Why would I do such a thing?

762
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,045
She was killed with that Russian gun, a Tokarev.

763
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,128
You're not looking so good, Mr. Kane.

764
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,723
I can stop if you like.

765
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,361
Why?

766
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,282
Revenge.

767
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,900
We hit the bank guard for the money.

768
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,365
We cut his hand off, we killed him.

769
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,565
We were kids.

770
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,526
You killed Ivan?

771
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,648
You killed my brother?

772
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,962
You started that war.

773
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,682
Call that gimp O'Connell.

774
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,650
When was your stint?

775
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,009
Four years ago I got out.

776
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,522
- And how long were you inside?
- What difference does it make?

777
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,365
Just answer the question, how long?

778
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,447
Five years on an eight year sentence.

779
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,646
Aggravated assault, possession.

780
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,009
Right, yeah, I remember when it went down.

781
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,924
All over the papers.

782
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,489
A crate full of Israeli sub-machine guns
and all you got was possession.

783
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,688
- Plea bargain?
- No!

784
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,081
- And I don't like what you're gettin' at.
- What am I getting at?

785
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:58,049
- Paulie...
- No one has one clue who killed my daughter.

786
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,035
Not one.

787
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,128
Took-up all those Russians last night,
not a single one of them knew anything,

788
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,047
if they did, they woulda cracked, so YOU tell me.

789
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,826
Paulie, I did not rat and you know
I wouldn't rat, it was the driver.

790
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:13,641
He didn't know shit!
Never saw our faces, never knew what hit him.

791
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,571
- Paulie, listen to me.
- But you shot him!

792
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,410
So, now, we'll never know.

793
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,286
Paulie, you gotta listen to me, all right?
Just listen to me.

794
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,263
- The whole reason I'm back with O'Connell?
- Uh-huh?

795
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,764
Is because I didn't drop a dime on nobody!

796
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,329
I got a light rap because they
misplaced some of the evidence.

797
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,748
How about, still, you went down nine years ago, so that was what?

798
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,121
What? That was two, three years after we split the cash?

799
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,207
So, what are you getting at?

800
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,443
The weapons you got caught with, did you use
the money to buy them, and don't lie to me.

801
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,490
Yeah, of course I did. What the hell?
What's the big deal?

802
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,436
What's the big deal?

803
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,602
They took Caitlin and they shot her.

804
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:02,603
Maybe... maybe that's not a big deal to you,
but it's a pretty fuckin' big deal to me.

805
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:06,442
And the only reason they would do
something like that is if someone talked.

806
01:15:06,477 --> 01:15:09,130
No one asked you, no one asked you where
you got the money for those guns.

807
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,726
O'Connell didn't want to know how you knew how
you could pull-off something like that on your own?

808
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,801
- Paulie!
- Yeah?

809
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,691
- I've always been loyal.
- You've always been an idiot!

810
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,846
Screw you, Paulie!

811
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,048
Nothing's ever your fault.

812
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,561
There's always someone else to blame,

813
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:25,167
always someone there to bail you out.

814
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,568
Who... who's bailing you out now?
Who's man are you now?

815
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,802
Are you my man?
Are you Chernov's man?

816
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,923
- Are you O'Connell's man?
- Take it easy, Paulie! Easy!

817
01:15:32,924 --> 01:15:36,189
- Knock it off!
- You talked!!!!!

818
01:15:36,224 --> 01:15:36,745
I didn't talk!

819
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:37,879
Someone got to your boss.

820
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,932
- They take care of you, make those guns go away.
- That's not what...

821
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,927
O'Connell talked,
and now my daughter's dead!

822
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,603
We swore not to talk about it,

823
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,564
not to spend the money,
not to draw attention to ourselves!

824
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,211
- I'm not a rat!
- You are a rat!

825
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,971
- Rat! Rat! Rat!
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

826
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,087
You... you swore it!

827
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,562
Paulie, shit, man!

828
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,045
I loved you, and you swore.

829
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,883
Danny, come on, Danny.

830
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,688
Danny.

831
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,361
You got to get up, Man.
Get up, Danny!

832
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,728
Danny.

833
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,129
I 'm with you, bro.

834
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,330
What is so damned important you had
to pull me away from my nephew's football game?

835
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,089
Anton.

836
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,330
I believe that belongs to you.

837
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,088
No, hasn't been mine for many, many years.

838
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:30,449
- I have no responsibility.
- Responsibility, huh?

839
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,603
When I was nineteen years old,

840
01:17:36,038 --> 01:17:41,965
I was the number one, light heavyweight champion
in the Soviet Olympic Boxing Team, did you know this?

841
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,442
No, I don't like sports.

842
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,121
And especially not Soviet Sports.

843
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,967
I had a shot at number one.

844
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,343
I could have been the champion,
except my father had a little problem.

845
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,162
He was a pathetic gambler,

846
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,250
and he could no longer pay his debt.

847
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:09,645
The Russian Mob, the Brita,
placed the burden on my shoulders.

848
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:14,322
I could clear his debt by taking a fall
by losing to the champion.

849
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,169
What do you think I did?

850
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:21,007
- I don't know, I don't have a clue, fill me in.
- Doesn't have a clue.

851
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,205
I took a beating for my father,
I lost for him.

852
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,362
No child should have to pay for their father's sins.

853
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,084
But the Bratwa
took me in,

854
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,261
gave me new life.

855
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,967
When my father fell for the debt again,

856
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,282
who do you think they sent to collect?

857
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:43,763
Me.

858
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:51,002
My father failed, just as your man here failed you.

859
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,888
I told you he's not mine any longer,
are you deaf?

860
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,807
You know the Maguire fellow, the one in the news?

861
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,685
The one whose daughter'd been killed, huh?

862
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,846
What about him?

863
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,801
He was the one who killed my brother.

864
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,170
He was the one who started the war between us.

865
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,004
The one who landed you in that chair.

866
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,611
So you see...

867
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,646
I invited you here to ask
you to do one thing for me.

868
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,638
Take responsibility.

869
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,922
Let me make one thing clear,

870
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,926
I don't take orders from people like you.

871
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,889
Russian scumbag!

872
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,323
Do what you have to do.

873
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,171
Whatever it takes.

874
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,407
Tokarev,

875
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,411
TT- 33.

876
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,766
It's an old army sidearm.

877
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,608
It's a favorite of the Russian Mafia.

878
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,246
No, no, do not!

879
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,089
Evan!

880
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,363
Evan!

881
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,206
What was so important?

882
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,564
I'm sorry, Mike.

883
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:25,689
What?

884
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,167
Sorry.

885
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,691
It was an accident...

886
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,926
No! Please!

887
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:40,080
I didn't mean to! C'mon, you have
to believe me! No, no, please, please no.

888
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:47,929
Okay,

889
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,871
We... we... we were hanging out,
and drinking, as normal,

890
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:56,370
and... and... and talking about...
about how you used to be a gangster.

891
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,284
So, where does he keep the loot, huh?

892
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,641
Shut up!

893
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,240
C'mon, how many times do I have
to tell you guys, my dad is a...

894
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,482
A legitimate businessman.

895
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,529
Yes.

896
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,728
Yeah, has he ever been arrested?

897
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,530
Maybe YOU should ask him when he gets home.

898
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:19,969
No---
Honestly, he kinda scares the shit outta me.

899
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,008
Pussy.

900
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,643
Have you ever seen or heard anything?

901
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:30,286
Like secret phone calls
or wads of cash lying around?

902
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,449
- Wait, did you see that?
- Totally.

903
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,648
- Did you see that?
- Come on, you know something,

904
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,608
something cool.

905
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,729
Come on, spill it.

906
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,527
Caitlin,
please----

907
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,529
All right.

908
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,248
Serious?

909
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,568
Yeah, yeah, I'll show you something.

910
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:48,689
Yes----

911
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,730
We went upstairs,
she... she said she had something cool to show us.

912
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,771
I'd never held a gun before, you know.

913
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,570
It... it... it was scary and cool and,

914
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,650
I know I shoulda put it down.

915
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,205
But I didn't.

916
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,328
Take some of this, you assholes!

917
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,287
Evan, come on,
don't make me chase you!

918
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,442
- Come on, let's go!
- It's raining.

919
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,641
So what, it's rain.
Are you gonna melt?

920
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,091
All right, come on, Evan,
we gotta put it back.

921
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,766
- No! It's not even loaded!
- Don't be an asshole, c'mon.

922
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,129
- Give it over.
- Fine, buzzkill, jeez.

923
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,610
Jesus, you, too?

924
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,810
All right, hand it over.

925
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,490
Oh God!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

926
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,171
Is she dead?

927
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,203
No!

928
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,924
I didn't hear her coming.

929
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,923
I wasn't paying attention,

930
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,531
I was a little drunk,
and... and... and the gun was so cool, you know.

931
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,530
and it felt...

932
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,286
I didn't know she was gonna be right behind me!

933
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,409
I...

934
01:25:46,973 --> 01:25:49,984
It was an accident.

935
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,810
I didn't know what to do.

936
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,566
We dragged her into the woods.

937
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,046
We put the guns back,

938
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,006
we trashed the house to make it seem like a home invasion.

939
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,842
I figured...
with your history,

940
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,363
the cops would think it was a mob hit or something.

941
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,489
I'm so sorry,

942
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,490
I didn't want to kill her.

943
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,967
I was scared. I was scared!
I loved her,

944
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,691
I swear to God, I loved her so much.

945
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,410
Please say something!

946
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,283
Just end this.

947
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,168
Please.

948
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,529
I can't take it anymore.

949
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,368
Please.

950
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,881
Hey, baby.

951
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,403
Hi.

952
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,371
It's okay now.

953
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,771
It's all over.

954
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,083
It's good to hear your voice.

955
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:32,040
Come home,
know you'll be safe now,

956
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,203
Are you okay? You sound so...

957
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:42,083
I killed a man,
when I was seventeen.

958
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,125
Caitlin's age.

959
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,444
I got into a fight.

960
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,401
Someone handed me a knife.

961
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,846
Sometimes I dream about that night.

962
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,929
In the dream I see myself,

963
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,841
and I try to stop it,
but I can't.

964
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,603
Then I wake up,

965
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,607
and I wonder what would have happened,

966
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,321
if no one handed me that knife.

967
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,326
What my life,

968
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,845
what our lives,

969
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,411
might have been.

970
01:29:33,712 --> 01:29:35,012
Paul.

971
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,766
I'm sorry I let you down.

972
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,169
Paul?

973
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:40,843
Paul!
