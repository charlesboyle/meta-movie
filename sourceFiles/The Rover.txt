1
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,599
We're not turning
around. He's gone!

2
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,759
What do you mean, "He's gone"?

3
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,959
He was still moving.
I fucking saw him still moving.

4
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,599
We killed people!

5
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,399
What do you mean? Turn
the fucking car around!

6
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,559
He's gone! What are
we supposed to do?

7
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,039
Damn it, this shit's not worth
it for me to leave him there!

8
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,639
We killed people, man.

9
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,479
God damn it! Please, I'm
begging you. He's my fucking brother.

10
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,759
I said this would happen.

11
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,319
Fuck you, Archie!

12
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,479
Fuck you!

13
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,359
You can't go anywhere
without your brother.

14
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,199
And I very almost got
my head blown off,

15
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,159
because he's a fucking baby
who can't look after himself.

16
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,879
- Fuck you!
- Sit still!

17
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,581
God damn it!

18
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,399
So then, now,
look what happens to him.

19
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,119
Can't be feeling
responsible for that.

20
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,279
If he was a man who
could look after himself,

21
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,959
he'd be accepting it right now.

22
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,079
Fuck you. Say that again.

23
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,679
You heard me. You know it.

24
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,319
Fuck you, Archie! Say that again!

25
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,519
If he was a man, he
wouldn't be crying about it,

26
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,599
he'd be accepting it.

27
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,599
Say that one more goddamn time.

28
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,679
I said it twice.

29
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,319
One more goddamn time, Archie.

30
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,639
If I said it again, I'd say
it the exact same way,

31
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,319
and that'd be three
times I said it!

32
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
Fuck!

33
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,439
Let's go. Come on, come on, come on.

34
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,301
Come on!

35
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,381
Who's this?

36
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,991
- That's our truck, man.
- What?

37
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,919
What the fuck's he doing?

38
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,621
Jesus, fuck!

39
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,671
Fuck!

40
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,023
Fuck!

41
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,461
Fuck!

42
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,262
- Is he giving up?
- He ain't giving up.

43
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,439
What's he doing?

44
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,268
What's he doing?

45
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,862
He's gonna keep following us, man.

46
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,119
Okay, okay, okay.

47
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,586
Fuck you. Fuck you.

48
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,271
He's moving.

49
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,461
What's going on with you, brother?

50
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,465
I said what's going on, brother?

51
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,039
I want my car back.

52
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,151
Yeah, I can see that.

53
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,150
You ain't gettin' it back.

54
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,945
I want my car back.

55
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,199
If you don't give it to me now,

56
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,347
I'm gonna get back in that truck and
I'm gonna stay on you till you do.

57
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,719
What makes you think I
won't kill you right here?

58
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,421
Huh?

59
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,639
Nothing makes me think that.

60
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,990
Come on, just for a little...

61
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,588
Area one, all clear. Over.

62
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,263
Do you need anything?

63
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,119
I'm looking for my car.
It's got three people in it.

64
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,759
It hasn't stopped here.

65
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,079
They needed petrol.

66
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,199
I haven't got any petrol.

67
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,519
Did you see it?

68
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,399
I haven't seen a car with three people
in it. Do you want to buy something?

69
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,661
I've got tins of stuff and some
auto accessories and other things.

70
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,079
I'm looking for a car
with three people in it.

71
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,679
Have you seen it?

72
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,399
No.

73
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,919
Anyone else seen it?

74
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,919
I don't know.

75
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,839
Who would know?

76
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,519
Maybe Grandma.

77
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,039
Where's Grandma?

78
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,027
Down there.

79
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,399
I'm looking for my car.
It's got three men in it.

80
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,751
Did it come through here?

81
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,879
What's your name?

82
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,799
Have you seen it?

83
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,581
What's your name?

84
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,239
Have you seen it?

85
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,908
Do you want something?

86
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,519
Do you want to sleep with a boy?

87
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,870
I've got a boy here
you can sleep with.

88
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,066
He's smooth like the
inside of your arm.

89
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,825
Stop fucking whispering.

90
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,671
I need to buy a gun.

91
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,639
Stop fucking whispering.
I'll fucking kill ya.

92
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,583
- You understand?
- I need a gun.

93
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,999
Fuck!

94
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,599
Fuck this shit!

95
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,782
Fucking son of a bitch.

96
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,879
Shut up!

97
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,227
God, no.

98
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,025
No...

99
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,759
Have you got guns?

100
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,667
What does it look
like I'm doing up here?

101
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,261
I heard you. I heard what you need.

102
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,107
Fucking psycho.

103
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,149
Careful.

104
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,399
They're 30 each. That
one's 300. That one's 300.

105
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,279
And that one's 300.
I only take US dollars.

106
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,199
I don't have 300.

107
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,839
They're $300 US.

108
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,999
Can you do this one for less?

109
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,239
I told you how much they cost.

110
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,599
I don't have $300 US.

111
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,268
They're 300. You don't have
300, you can fuck off.

112
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,822
I'm looking for my car.
Have you seen it?

113
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,279
Tell me your name.
I want to know your name.

114
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,399
- Answer my question.
- Answer mine.

115
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,919
Answer my question.
I'm not gonna say it again.

116
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,906
Okay.

117
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,639
I'll call you "my baby."

118
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,944
My baby.

119
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,626
There was a car

120
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,959
and it had three men in it and
it did what most cars do.

121
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,822
It came in one direction
and left in the other.

122
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,479
That's all I can tell you about it.

123
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,799
The only detail I can tell you is the
detail that pertains to this place.

124
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,559
I can tell you what they drank.

125
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,308
I can tell you what
they smelled like.

126
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,991
I can tell you what they
said, if they said anything

127
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,479
and if I heard what it
was that they said.

128
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,148
What did they say?

129
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,749
They didn't say anything.
They didn't stop here.

130
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,119
You must really love
that car, darling.

131
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,348
What a thing to get worked
up about in this day and age.

132
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,790
What is it about the car
that you love so much?

133
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,424
Can you tell me?

134
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,908
What's your name, sweetheart?

135
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,230
Oh, don't be silly.

136
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,502
Now you're just being rude.

137
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,862
What are you doing with this car?

138
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,599
It's my brother's car.

139
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,109
Who's your brother?

140
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,020
Where is he?

141
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,544
Where's Henry at?

142
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,987
Who's your brother? Where is he?

143
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,199
You tell me where he is,
or I'm gonna kill you.

144
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,902
Where is he?

145
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,439
There's no doctor here.

146
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,079
I'm about the most useful
person in this town.

147
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,999
If that gives you any idea how far
from having a doctor this town is.

148
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,319
Is there a doctor somewhere else?

149
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,319
Buy something.

150
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,159
I told you what I've got. I've got
tins of things and drinks and stuff.

151
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,399
I have to deal with
this shit all day.

152
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,639
Please.

153
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,359
I'm not joking.

154
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,439
You can say "please" all you
like, but I'm not joking.

155
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,667
Now, pick yourself
something off the shelf.

156
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,148
Pay Benny.

157
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,639
There's a doctor in them
hills there. Head east,

158
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,479
and follow the road that looks like it
leads to those hills, you'll get there.

159
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,502
It's got a big yellow fridge out the
front, says "Peeples" written on it.

160
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,719
Pull the gun out of your pants.

161
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,679
I've got a kid in the
car who needs help.

162
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,862
Pull the gun out of your pants
and put it on the ground.

163
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,706
He needs help.

164
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,341
Is this man your friend?

165
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,999
How much do you want
for doing this?

166
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,749
I don't want your money.

167
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,911
I've gotten pretty good
living without money.

168
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,679
I have to keep these guys locked
up in here now for the most part,

169
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,146
'cause people take them for food.

170
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,959
These guys came to me.

171
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,359
People just drop them off

172
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,119
and ask me to look after them
while they went away somewhere

173
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,399
or because they had to go
somewhere or do something,

174
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,821
and none of them ever came back.

175
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,591
I guess they've gone
looking for money.

176
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,304
Do you want me to take
a look at your cuts?

177
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,386
No.

178
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,068
Hey.

179
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,742
How ya going?

180
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,461
I'm well.

181
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:44,748
Um, do you wanna take a chair
while I have a look at you?

182
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,023
It hurts.

183
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,479
Do you want to take your hand away?

184
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,662
That doesn't look too bad.

185
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,901
That looks good. You just
need to keep this clean.

186
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,221
Tell me where your brother is.

187
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,865
I'll take you to him.

188
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,386
Tell me where your brother is.

189
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,141
Mmm.

190
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,747
He's gone south a long way from here.
I'll take you to him, I promise.

191
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,061
I'm just gonna get you a T-shirt.

192
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,071
Get up. We're leaving.

193
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,631
Maybe we should ask
what the lady says.

194
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,559
Get up.

195
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,559
- What was that sound?
- It's a car coming.

196
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,759
What car?

197
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,959
I don't know.

198
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,239
That's two cars.

199
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,919
- How long till they're here?
- A minute, maybe.

200
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,119
Who is it?

201
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,519
Get your rifle.

202
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,268
- Do you know them?
- Go and get your rifle.

203
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,304
Tell me what's going on.

204
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,670
Who are these people?

205
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,426
Get up. We're leaving.

206
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,031
Get up.

207
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,469
Where are we?

208
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,947
I'm hungry.

209
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,907
Go and get some food?

210
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,227
You're gonna start talking to me.

211
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,399
What?

212
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,786
Don't fucking "what" me.
Where are we going?

213
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,999
I can't tell you nothing more
than I already told you.

214
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,999
I don't give a shit what you
think you've already told me.

215
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,719
Start fucking talking to me!

216
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,799
Don't.

217
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,919
Do you even know where we are?

218
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,679
- What?
- Where are we?

219
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,959
Where are we?

220
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,359
I don't know.

221
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,079
You don't fucking know?

222
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,679
So, how are you gonna
get to where you're going

223
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,384
if you don't know where
the fuck you are?

224
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,585
Do you even understand
what I just said, half-wit?

225
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,027
We're going to Carloon.

226
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,799
We're going to Carloon.

227
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,519
I just asked that lady how
to get to Carloon from here.

228
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,639
I was gonna do that anyway
and you would've heard me

229
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,039
and you would've asked her what I
said, figured out what I said anyway.

230
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,027
I was gonna tell you anyway.

231
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,783
You wanna know so bad.

232
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,359
But you don't know exactly where
in Carloon we're going exactly,

233
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,542
so, I'm still in control here.

234
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,279
You don't know exactly where
in Carloon we're going,

235
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,709
so you got to take me with you.

236
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,799
I'm taking you with me
because if I get to Carloon

237
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,901
and your brother's not there,
I'm gonna slit your throat.

238
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,670
What you want with my
brother so bad, hmm?

239
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,666
Who are you?

240
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,199
I'm Rey. Is that what you mean?

241
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,380
Why are you here?

242
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,439
Me and my brother came out for
the mines. Like everybody else.

243
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,462
Why's your brother in Carloon?

244
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,559
That's where he was gonna go.

245
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,787
Why are you here and your
brother's in Carloon?

246
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,023
They had to get going
in a big hurry.

247
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,984
Why?

248
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,911
Why did he have to get
going in a big hurry?

249
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,463
I don't know.
I can't talk about it.

250
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,944
Why did your brother have to
get to Carloon in a big hurry?

251
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,710
I can't talk about it.

252
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,599
Well, whatever it was he did,

253
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,383
you got left here to die
while he was doing it.

254
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,559
- It didn't happen like that.
- Really?

255
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,991
How did it happen, then?

256
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,910
I can't talk about it no more,
just stop asking about everything.

257
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,799
'Cause I believe in God and I
know Henry believes in God,

258
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,519
and there's no harm Henry
would want to see me come to.

259
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,143
I believe in that.

260
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,146
Yet look at the harm you've
come to and where's Henry?

261
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,399
He's waiting for me.

262
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,341
He's not waiting for you.

263
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,839
Yes, he is.

264
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,144
No, he's not.

265
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,990
I'll tell you what God's given you.

266
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,782
He's put a bullet in you.

267
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,871
And he's abandoned you out here
to me, who feels nothing for you.

268
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,679
I couldn't give a fuck
if you die tomorrow.

269
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,639
God gave you a brother
who's not waiting for you.

270
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,425
He gave you a brother who's not
even thinking about you right now.

271
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,750
Just because you and him came
out of the same woman's hole.

272
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,679
The only thing that means
anything right now

273
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,862
is that I'm here and he's not.

274
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,639
Your brother left you to die.

275
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,468
That's what people do.

276
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,382
You don't learn to fight, your
death's gonna come real soon.

277
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,199
This is 5-1. Passage is called 2-11.

278
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,902
We should be clear
or clearing shortly.

279
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,679
4-3-7 Echo.

280
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,639
4-3-7 Echo. This is K-K.
Do you copy?

281
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,265
Stop shooting!

282
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,909
I just wanted to fight.

283
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,382
I just wanted to fight him.

284
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,866
Let's go.

285
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,346
Come on.

286
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,879
That lady said it would take about
eight hours to get there, in the old days.

287
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,999
But it might take longer now 'cause a lot
of them old roads ain't there no more.

288
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,466
And all the roads are bad now anyways
so you can't drive fast on 'em.

289
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,599
She said about eight or nine hours.

290
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,079
She wasn't sure if it
was eight or nine.

291
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,306
She seemed a bit confused about it.

292
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,466
And why would he still be there?

293
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,311
He had to wait two
weeks for someone.

294
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,991
There's a man there he's got to
meet, it's gonna take two weeks.

295
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,063
You know this? Or this
is what he told you?

296
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,821
Huh?

297
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,039
Your brother can't be trusted.

298
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,825
Is this something that you know or
is this something that he told you?

299
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,504
Both those things.

300
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,189
You work in the mines?

301
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,821
No.

302
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,344
What do you do then?

303
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,786
I was a farmer. And now I'm here.

304
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,439
Then how come you learned
how to shoot so good?

305
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,551
You was in the army?

306
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,519
When I was a little kid
I grew up on a farm.

307
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:50,959
We had these neighbors, real old
man and lady, Verna and Clarry,

308
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,071
they's brother and sister.

309
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,279
And they lived on this
land that's all overgrown,

310
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,541
like you couldn't even tell what
they farmed, so overgrown.

311
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,039
And Clarry had these eight tractors,
and none of them worked properly,

312
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,559
so every morning he'd roll each one down
the hill till he got one of them started

313
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,582
and then use that one to tow all
the others back up.

314
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,029
He did that every day.

315
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,719
And when they died, their family,
who we'd never met before,

316
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,946
came around, cleared
out their house

317
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,199
and they found all this...

318
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,744
They found all this
weird stuff in there.

319
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,666
Like...

320
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,304
Like 50 therm...

321
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,228
Thermionic radio valves.

322
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,583
Like them real old valves
they used in old radios.

323
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,421
And pyramid of pumpkins.

324
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:56,479
And about 5,000 of these
little sticks about this long.

325
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,949
And each wrapped up in newspaper and
tied up at the ends with baling twine.

326
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,388
Why are you telling me this?

327
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,349
I just remembered it.

328
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,143
It interested me.

329
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,144
Not everything has to
be about something.

330
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,743
I'm tryin' to stop thinking about
that little girl who died, but I can't.

331
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,225
You shouldn't.

332
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,105
But I can't.

333
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,345
You shouldn't stop
thinking about her.

334
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,919
You should never stop thinking
about a life you've taken.

335
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,191
It's the price you
pay for taking it.

336
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,599
That's it, sweetheart.

337
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,302
Let's start with the eyelids.

338
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,559
I want you to roll over onto your
front, put your hands behind your back.

339
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,830
And do it slow.

340
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,665
And do it now.

341
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,230
When are you
gonna say something, cunt?

342
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,945
It's over.

343
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,710
It's over for you.

344
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,905
I know that.

345
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,981
That's good that you know that.

346
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,239
Do you know it, too?

347
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,999
Oh, I know it, champ.

348
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,190
I told you it.

349
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,866
Do you know it's over for you, too?

350
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,239
Whatever you think's over for
me was over a long time ago.

351
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,479
I'm asking about you.

352
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,279
Are you threatening me?

353
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,027
No.

354
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,262
A threat means there's still
something left to happen.

355
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,541
What are you gonna do with me?

356
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,429
You're going to Sydney.

357
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,548
Why don't you just shoot me?

358
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,629
Why don't you do it?

359
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,980
That's what everyone else is doing.

360
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,039
Because me sending you to Sydney

361
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:35,745
tells Sydney there's a reason to
keep paying us what they pay us.

362
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,799
If we just shot every
idiot we wanted to shoot,

363
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:44,062
then pretty soon they'd start to wonder
what the fuck we're doing out here.

364
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,759
See, personally
I don't care about you.

365
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,679
I don't care if you get to Sydney and they
let you off or you bribe your way out

366
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,799
or whatever the fuck they
do down there these days.

367
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,229
I don't give a fuck.

368
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,223
I'm doing this for me.

369
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,348
You're doing what for you?

370
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,428
You're doing what for you?

371
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,549
I murdered my wife.

372
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,359
I followed her to a man's house,

373
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,159
I watched him put his fingers
inside her and I killed 'em both.

374
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,908
No one ever came after me.

375
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,230
Ten years ago.

376
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,341
I never had to explain myself.

377
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,519
I never had to lie to anyone.
I never had to run and hide.

378
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,239
I just buried 'em in a
hole and I went home.

379
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,988
No one ever came after me.

380
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,588
And that hurt me more than
getting my heart broken.

381
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,542
Knowing it didn't matter.

382
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,470
Knowing you can do something like
that and no one comes after you.

383
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,946
You do a thing like I did, that
should really mean something.

384
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,260
But it just doesn't matter anymore.

385
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,825
Well, champ.

386
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,950
Thing you did in Abo town is the
one thing that does matter to us.

387
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,622
Now you can do all the lying
and confessing you'd like.

388
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,581
What feeling do you have when
you wake up in the morning?

389
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,141
When your feet touch the floor?

390
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:51,866
Or before that, when you're lying there
thinking about your feet hitting the floor.

391
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,101
What does that feel like for you?

392
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,719
Do you know what I'm talking about?

393
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,039
No, mate. I don't.

394
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,119
You don't?

395
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,461
No, mate. I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

396
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,599
What the fuck?

397
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,821
Phew!

398
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,305
Is that it?

399
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,026
That was easy.

400
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,221
Do I shoot him again
just to be sure?

401
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,079
No.

402
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,239
Mmm.

403
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,639
That was easy. There
were only three of 'em.

404
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,866
Thought it was gonna
be way more harder.

405
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,185
You tied up?

406
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,519
I snuck up on these two.

407
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,427
They were just hanging there.

408
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,983
I came through the gate here.

409
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,144
I dug a hole out. Slipped
underneath the fence.

410
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,622
Get the truck over there.

411
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,270
Come on, man.

412
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,981
You want me to drive for a while?

413
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,301
No.

414
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:53,626
I know I feel comfortable with someone
when I can just sit, not talking to them.

415
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,661
Yeah.

416
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,661
I just like sitting
there, not talking.

417
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,104
I just feel comfortable
sittin' there, you know.

418
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,107
I had a pain in my side real bad.

419
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,703
It's starting to hurt.

420
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,590
I think maybe I gotta
do something with it.

421
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,870
Don't look bad?

422
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:26,261
Let's put that bandage back on.

423
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,269
I think it broke, man.

424
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,239
You got any fuel?

425
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,799
50 US.

426
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,319
50 Australian.

427
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,879
US dollars.

428
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,439
I'm out of US.

429
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,824
I only take American money.

430
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,319
What's wrong with Australian money?

431
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,119
Either take it or leave it.

432
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,948
It's paper. It's worthless.

433
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,399
Yeah, whatever, mate, I don't care.

434
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,079
It's a piece of fucking paper!

435
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,999
Take it or leave it.

436
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,031
How much you need, man?

437
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,385
50 US.

438
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,999
Have you got any .38 in there?

439
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,079
Yeah.

440
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,782
Let me get a box of that.

441
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:11,229
And a box of 9 millimeter
for my friend here.

442
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,190
Thank you kindly.

443
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,224
There's the house.

444
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,199
All them others empty.

445
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,506
They ain't got people
in them anymore.

446
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,948
Are they alone in there?

447
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,439
For now they are.

448
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:43,959
Until them other people come, but that ain't
gonna be for another week or somethin'.

449
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,719
And there's Gordon, whose
house it is, but he's old.

450
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,660
Real old.

451
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,709
Do you know this?

452
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,105
I know it.

453
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,759
We'll go there in the morning.

454
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,462
There'll be less trouble.

455
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,904
I'm gonna kill him.

456
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,268
I'm going to kill Henry.

457
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,465
Go to sleep.

458
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,548
There's money up there too,
we can take if we want.

459
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,431
Go to sleep.

460
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,630
What you doing?

461
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,984
What you doing?

462
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,910
Just wait there.

463
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,750
They're asleep.

464
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,264
There's two in the back
room. I'll take them.

465
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,590
There's two in the room
on the other side.

466
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,599
If you take them, we'll bring
them into this front room.

467
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,999
Okay? But no shooting.

468
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,065
All right?

469
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,270
Don't say a word.

470
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:57,586
Slowly lift your
head off the pillow.

471
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,591
What the fuck?

472
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,743
Kick your blanket off.

473
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,029
Both of you get up.

474
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,981
Henry.

475
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,181
Henry.

476
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,070
Henry, wake up.

477
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,027
Rey?

478
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,380
You gotta get up.

479
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,429
Rey, what the fuck?

480
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,959
You too, Gordon.

481
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,869
You gotta get up. You both
gotta get up outta bed.

482
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,439
What are you doing? Stop
pointing that thing at me.

483
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:36,030
Don't make me keep saying it.
You got to get up out of bed.

484
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:41,746
Sit down. Sit.

485
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,944
Sit on your hands.

486
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,101
What's going on in there?

487
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,119
See, Henry?

488
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,159
You gotta get up outta bed.

489
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,669
Rey, who's in there?

490
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,228
He won't get up outta bed.

491
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,311
Put the gun down, Rey.

492
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,359
You put yours down.

493
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,791
Rey, put the gun down.
I ain't playing.

494
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:18,519
Why are you doing this?

495
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,319
Why did you leave me there?

496
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,590
Leave you where?

497
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,759
You know where. On the
road, when I was shot.

498
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,239
Rey, we thought you was dead.

499
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,879
No.

500
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,559
But I wasn't. But I wasn't
dead and you left me there.

501
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,867
Rey, I thought you was dead.
Now put down the fuckin' gun!

502
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,704
You put yours down.

503
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,224
What's going on?

504
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,039
I gotta piss.

505
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,583
Don't you fuckin' move.

506
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,039
I thought you was my brother, man.

507
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:05,506
God damn it, Rey! I am your brother.
Now put down the fuckin' gun.

508
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,439
I thought you was my brother.

509
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,759
Rey, if you don't put down
the gun I'm gonna shoot you.

510
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,030
All right? I ain't lyin'.

511
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,159
You was supposed to be my
brother, Henry. You told Pa.

512
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,624
Rey, put down the goddamn gun!

513
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,599
I thought you was my brother
and you just left me there.

514
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,461
What's going on in there?

515
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,667
What did you do to my brother?

516
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,501
Huh?

517
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,711
Answer me.

518
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,701
What did you do to my brother?

519
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,509
I didn't do anything.

520
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,870
Yes, you did.

521
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,229
What did you do to him?
