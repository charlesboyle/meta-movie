1
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:33,004
Last night, the FAA was forced to ground
all aircraft, leaving thousands stranded...

2
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,882
when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages...

3
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,719
crippled the western United States.
But the big story today...

4
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,847
the much-anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple...

5
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:47,476
Reed Richards and Susan Storm
will take place this Saturday.

6
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,399
Unbelievable. Bizarre anomalies...

7
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,361
are occurring all over the world,
defying every law of physics...

8
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,907
and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked.

9
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:05,786
What did you pick? The blue ones
with them little flowers? l like them.

10
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,663
Excuse me, would you mind?

11
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,791
- lt's happening again, isn't it?
- Yeah, sure.

12
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,295
No. We're not postponing
anything, not this time.

13
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,050
This will be the wedding you dreamed of.
L won't let anything get in the way.

14
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:24,180
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

15
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,309
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

16
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,562
Which is really pathetic,
when you think about it.

17
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,941
Dr. Richards, I'm very sorry,
but we're overbooked.

18
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,819
- We do have seats available in coach.
- Okay, here we go.

19
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,279
- Smile!
- Awesome!

20
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,822
Look, Mom!

21
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,825
- Let me get one more.
- That should be fine.

22
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,122
That's my seat.

23
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,917
Sorry.

24
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,974
Excuse me.

25
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,280
What if we get an endorsement
from an airline? Get us a private jet?

26
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,117
L think we have enough
endorsement deals.

27
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:32,206
That's funny. Seriously, Reed, it could
help subsidize your little inventions.

28
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,417
- No, thanks.
- Excuse me.

29
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,754
- Consider it. Talk to you later.
- Where are you going?

30
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,131
L don't fly coach.

31
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,150
L hope it rains.

32
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,236
The snowfall came with no warning...

33
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,905
and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow.

34
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,200
In Japan, some suggest
the solidification of the bay...

35
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,536
was due to underwater
volcanic activity...

36
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,581
though no such activity
has been reported in the area.

37
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,708
Scientists have ruled out
global warming...

38
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:20,046
as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe.

39
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,049
With scientists unable
to explain the events...

40
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,469
some are wondering
if the hand of God is at work.

41
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,473
In other news, Reed Richards
and Susan Storm's wedding...

42
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,349
has Manhattan all abuzz.

43
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,103
The guest list includes
many of New York's power elite.

44
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,106
Hey, honey.

45
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,943
The city's charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed...

46
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:47,782
during that armored-car robbery.
L only remember two cars getting thrown.

47
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,659
Reed.

48
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,289
All right. I'm putting it away.

49
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,208
You were saying?

50
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,836
L have a fitting in half an hour.
The musicians after that.

51
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:05,925
L haven't picked out the place settings
or the flowers. There's too much to do.

52
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,262
Don't worry about it. Between
the two of us, we'll get it all done.

53
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,473
And what were you doing
when l walked in?

54
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,267
- Inputting my to-do list.
- Really?

55
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,603
- Scout's honor.
- Hey, guys.

56
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,606
New uniforms showed up.
What do you think?

57
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,986
L think there's no way
we're wearing that.

58
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,615
What do you have against capitalism?

59
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,369
What's this?

60
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,621
- Just a little hobby of mine.
- Yeah?

61
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,625
Would it make a good toy,
or is it something science-y?

62
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,418
A little of both.

63
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,883
I'm both impressed
and disgusted at that.

64
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,427
Yeah. Sue says I'm addicted to it.

65
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,638
L wonder why she'd say that.

66
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,223
Hey, Johnny.

67
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,979
Keep it quiet, but I've cross-referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances.

68
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,317
They're caused by cosmic radiation, not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers.

69
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,778
Wow, that's really boring.

70
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:12,950
Listen, l have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about.

71
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,618
Yeah, of course.

72
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,704
Your bachelor party.

73
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,748
No. Seriously, Johnny.

74
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,253
John. Focus-testing showed Johnny
skewed a little young.

75
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,175
Seriously, Johnny, no bachelor party.
Lt's just not my kind of thing.

76
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:34,388
Then do it for Ben. lt means a lot
to the big guy. You'll break his heart.

77
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,849
He does have some
sort of rock-like heart.

78
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,893
L have too much to do
before the wedding.

79
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,812
L think Sue might have
a problem with it.

80
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,107
You know what Sue
would have a problem with?

81
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,110
If somebody told her
you were investigating...

82
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,446
global disturbances
and cosmic radiation...

83
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,367
instead of focusing on the wedding,
like you promised.

84
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,631
- A bachelor party could be fun.
- Yes!

85
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,716
But no exotic dancers.

86
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,266
- This is it?
- L don't know anybody here.

87
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,811
L would have invited your friends,
but you don't have any.

88
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,229
Hey!

89
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,564
Johnny, we had a deal.

90
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,526
They're not exotic dancers.

91
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,237
They're just hot.

92
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:20,119
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?
That's so awesome.

93
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,250
Wow, you're really cute.

94
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,128
I'll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you've got.

95
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,796
No problem.

96
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,606
Good evening,
and welcome to the Baxter....

97
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,029
Could l help you?
No, you can't use that elev...

98
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,704
Ms. Storm will be with your shortly.

99
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,583
Hello?

100
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,835
Thanks, Roberta.

101
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,630
May l help you?

102
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,926
- We're here to see Dr. Richards.
- He's not here. Can l help you?

103
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,846
Yes. You can take me
to see Dr. Richards.

104
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,016
Okay.

105
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,567
Sorry.

106
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,823
When the universe began, it was
no bigger than a marble. Then, bang!

107
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,535
Lt exploded.
And in a trillionth of a second...

108
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,081
it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know.

109
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,292
Wow, you're really smart.

110
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,128
Thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

111
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,131
L love this song. Wanna dance?

112
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,674
- No, l don't.
- Yes, you do.

113
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,885
- Honestly.
- Come on, you'll be great.

114
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,638
L don't want to embarrass you guys.

115
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,526
Just loosen up. Have some fun.

116
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,445
That's it.

117
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,696
Yeah.

118
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,784
That's it.

119
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,214
- Guy really knows how to loosen up.
- You're not kidding.

120
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,364
There he is.

121
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,532
Yes.

122
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,868
Unfortunately.

123
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,375
For him.

124
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,130
Shall we?

125
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,888
L think it might be clobbering time.

126
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,640
Sue. What are you...?

127
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,812
General Hager.

128
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,857
Let's talk somewhere private.

129
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,652
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

130
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,907
L was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to....

131
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:49,077
This was Johnny's idea.
L just went along.

132
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,457
How does Reed know the general?

133
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,169
A few years back, the guy was pushing
a new missile-defense system.

134
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,379
Reed testified that the
technology wouldn't work.

135
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,799
I'm here on direct orders from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

136
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:07,095
Personally, l don't like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian.

137
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,766
Especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much.

138
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,936
Always a pleasure
to see you too, general.

139
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,396
What can l do for you?

140
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,691
As you may know, there've
been unusual occurrences.

141
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,612
Officially, we've downplayed their
significance, but we're concerned...

142
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:28,617
these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security.

143
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:33,038
These were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago.

144
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,961
- What is it?
- We hoped Dr. Richards could tell us.

145
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,923
I'm afraid I've never
seen anything like it. Ben?

146
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,845
L would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

147
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,223
Lt's giving off its own energy.

148
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,891
Take a look at this.

149
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:57,104
These have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world.

150
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,816
Field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters.

151
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:06,238
To find out what this is about, we need
a way to locate and intercept that object.

152
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,701
A sensor could be tied into
the Baxter Building's satellite grid.

153
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,287
We can pinpoint the location
of the object.

154
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:17,874
- Good. You'll build the sensor for us...
- I'm afraid l can't.

155
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,502
What?

156
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,924
I'm getting married this Saturday.
L just don't have the time.

157
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,263
Richards, your country
needs your help.

158
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,559
Call Professor Jeff Wagner.

159
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,353
He's head of the
Physics Department at Brown.

160
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,522
L expected more, Richards.

161
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,650
Even from you.

162
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,791
John Storm,
Fantastic Four Incorporated.

163
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,003
- Ever done any modeling?
- Not interested.

164
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,214
- You got an amazing complexion.
- Not interested.

165
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,928
Wow, and you just walked away.

166
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,890
L was definitely still talking.

167
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,852
L can't believe you just turned down
a science project.

168
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,481
They can build a sensor without me.

169
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,609
The most important thing right now
is our wedding.

170
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,819
No postponements. No interruptions.

171
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,446
Thank you.

172
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,824
And, look, about what you saw
back at the bar....

173
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,786
Don't worry about it. l know you.

174
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,373
I'm glad you had fun.

175
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,583
Thank you.

176
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,960
Besides...

177
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,715
it was nothing compared to what
l did at my bachelorette party.

178
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,426
Talk about wild.

179
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,680
Wild?

180
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,441
Come on.

181
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,143
Hey, what are you doing up here?

182
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,521
Nothing. Just needed some air.

183
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,525
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

184
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,111
I'm guessing Susie
doesn't know anything about it.

185
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,905
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

186
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,659
That is, they would be if l had any.

187
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,245
Look, don't tell Johnny.

188
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,416
- Don't tell Johnny what?
- Great.

189
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,419
- Are you building that thing?
- No.

190
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,172
If Sue finds out, you'll get
an invisible kick in the nuts.

191
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,258
- Hey, hey. We're keeping this quiet.
- L know.

192
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,093
Don't worry.

193
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,931
Lt's the wedding of the century.
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

194
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,602
Mr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman...

195
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,981
will try again to tie the knot today
in a ceremony in New York.

196
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,912
- Look at these parasites.
- L know, it's unbelievable.

197
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,830
Have they no shame?

198
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,294
Hey! Hey, listen! Listen, everybody!

199
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,632
This is a very special day for my sister,
probably the most important of her life.

200
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,552
So l just want to say to you guys,
please respect our privacy.

201
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,596
Come on, Johnny.

202
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,600
Just kidding. We're auctioning off
the exclusive wedding photos...

203
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:08,021
to the highest bidder, so go online
and place your bids. Thank you.

204
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,773
Johnny, are you planning...?

205
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,400
So, what's it take to date
the Human Torch?

206
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,738
- Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.
- Thank you.

207
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,505
- Are you all right?
- How are you?

208
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,677
Invitation, sir?

209
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,637
L should be on that list.

210
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,556
- Name?
- Stan Lee.

211
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,224
Yeah, nice try, buddy.

212
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,309
- No, really. I'm Stan Lee.
- Nice try.

213
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,858
This isn't how l imagined it.

214
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,985
Lt never is.

215
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,780
No, Alicia, it just doesn't feel right.

216
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,367
Sweetie...

217
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:08,123
l think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding-day jitters.

218
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,918
Lt's more than that.
Ls my life always gonna be a circus?

219
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,797
Do we really want to raise kids
in all this?

220
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,383
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

221
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,595
Ben and l aren't normal...

222
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,390
but we don't let it
get in the way of us being happy.

223
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,060
Do you love Reed?

224
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,606
More than I've ever loved anyone.

225
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,693
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

226
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,780
Thank you.

227
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,541
Okay.

228
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,003
- Oh, great.
- What?

229
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,254
I've got a zit.

230
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,424
- Can't you put makeup on it?
- No, no, l got it.

231
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,968
Crisis averted.

232
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,931
Now all l have to do is concentrate
on the area for the next eight hours.

233
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,521
Reed, come on. You're gonna miss
your own wedding.

234
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,106
Just a minute.

235
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,943
Almost done.

236
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,491
General, I'm putting
the sensor online now.

237
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,419
There. If there's a surge in cosmic
radiation anywhere, you'll know.

238
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,756
Let's hope so. We've gotten
reports of two more craters.

239
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,466
Here comes the bride

240
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,219
All right. Just linking it to my PDA.

241
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,472
- Reed.
- And that's it.

242
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,892
Good, that's great.
Now shave and put on your tux.

243
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,353
You're getting married
and you look like a bum.

244
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,854
Absolutely.

245
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,400
What?

246
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,655
I'm getting married.

247
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,577
Oh, jeez.

248
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,664
I'm getting married.

249
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,168
L heard of getting cold feet....

250
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,050
Okay.

251
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,594
Hey, Johnny.

252
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,434
Does that amaze anyone else?
How did she know it was me?

253
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,311
To be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

254
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,857
- You're late.
- Let's not make today about me.

255
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,608
Lt's Reed and Sue's big day.

256
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,445
Let's give them the attention
for a change.

257
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,196
Don't do that.

258
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,867
- Okay, you're perfect.
- You're perfect.

259
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,123
I'll see you upstairs.

260
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,792
Bye, Johnny.

261
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,840
So seems like you and Alicia are
doing well. Annoyingly so, in fact.

262
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,342
Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

263
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,969
Yeah, you are.

264
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,014
Question for you, though:

265
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,974
How do you guys...?

266
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,773
- None of your business!
- Okay, I'm just concerned.

267
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,984
I'd hate to find out
she was killed in a rock slide.

268
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,819
I'll show you a rock slide!

269
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,341
What are you?

270
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,394
Thank you.

271
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,065
Johnny?

272
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,193
You shouldn't tease him so much.

273
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,778
Lt was a joke.

274
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:11,116
L don't know, l think it bothers you
to see him really happy and in love.

275
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,118
L think you're jealous.

276
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:17,288
You think I'm jealous?
Have you seen the women I've dated?

277
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:18,790
No.

278
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,712
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

279
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,717
Hey. lt's the bride of stretchy man.

280
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,720
- Don't start.
- Don't listen to him. You look gorgeous.

281
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,556
We'll see you out there, sweetie.

282
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,642
- Come on. We're on.
- Okay. Okay.

283
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,024
You don't look completely
ridiculous in that dress.

284
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,070
Ls that obnoxious-brother talk
for "You look kind of nice"?

285
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,073
You look beautiful.

286
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,452
Thank you.

287
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,511
Dad would be proud.

288
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,265
Yeah.

289
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,626
Reed, shut your cell phone off.

290
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,544
Actually, this is a...

291
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,338
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to....

292
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,677
Sue and Reed,
congratulations on your wedding!

293
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,806
Where was l? Oh, yeah.

294
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:44,227
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today to join this couple...

295
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,896
Reed Richards and Susan Storm,
together...

296
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,736
in the bond of holy...

297
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,615
matrimony.

298
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,618
L can't believe you
brought that to our wedding.

299
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,829
L know, but there's a good reason.

300
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,957
- We have to do this quickly.
- That's romantic.

301
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,210
- Should l continue?
- Yes, please.

302
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:14,424
- There are many kinds of love.
- Could you skip to the end, please?

303
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,509
- Reed.
- Excuse me?

304
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,438
- What happened?
- What's going on?

305
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,120
We've lost power!
We're going down! We're going down!

306
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,539
Lt's too late.

307
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,591
- Pull up!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

308
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,151
Ben!

309
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,708
- Johnny.
- This is Dolce.

310
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,047
Flame on!

311
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,773
Man, he's fast.

312
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,662
That is cool.

313
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,843
- Hey, taxi!
- Oh, man!

314
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,693
Showoff.

315
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,725
Time to end this.

316
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,814
Can we talk?

317
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,160
Okay, you win.

318
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,296
Flame on! Come on!

319
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,381
Flame on!

320
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,864
Hey.

321
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,671
Your herald summons you.

322
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,423
Another world awaits.

323
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,969
Let it be done quickly.

324
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:38,062
Lt looked like a man, but completely covered
in silver, and it flew this, like...

325
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:41,065
surfboard-type thing.
L know that sounds crazy.

326
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,150
Oh, no, not at all.

327
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:47,238
Did you follow the shiny man to
Lollipop Land or the Rainbow Junction?

328
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,866
- l know what l saw.
- Thank you. lt's all right, Johnny.

329
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:55,913
Whatever this thing is, it has the ability
to convert matter and energy.

330
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,832
So it caused the anomalies?

331
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,960
Lt seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself...

332
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:05,464
randomly affecting matter.
Evidently, this entity, this...

333
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,010
Silver Surfer...

334
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,598
didn't want to be detected.
Lt destroyed the sensor.

335
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,101
- lt knew it was being monitored?
- And traced it back here.

336
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,354
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

337
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,609
Are you feeling okay?

338
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,570
Yeah. l just.... l gotta walk this off.

339
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,452
We must destroy it
before it attacks again.

340
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,455
Richards, find me
another way to track it.

341
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,796
Sue, l am so sorry.

342
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,216
L didn't tell you, because l
didn't want you to worry.

343
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,470
I'm not mad you built the sensor.
You did the right thing.

344
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,013
Oh, great.

345
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,851
L wasn't finished.

346
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,523
Okay. Sorry. Please continue.

347
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,234
This proves what I've been saying.

348
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,653
Could you drop the force field?

349
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,738
We can't even... Sorry.

350
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,325
Even our wedding
turns into World War III.

351
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,579
L know. But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

352
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:22,583
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

353
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,087
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

354
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,717
I'm gonna go check on Johnny.

355
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,691
Johnny?

356
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,991
Hey, are you all right, pal?

357
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,620
Are you all right?

358
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,582
Johnny?

359
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,419
Johnny, are you okay?

360
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,923
L don't know. I've been feeling really
strange since my run-in with surfer boy.

361
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,634
Maybe we should get you checked out.

362
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,430
- Why did you do that?
- L didn't do anything!

363
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,640
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

364
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:23,269
Oh, my God, Sue! Just...

365
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,605
Just hang on! I'll get you, okay?

366
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:28,983
Flame on!

367
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,777
Hey, watch it.

368
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,783
Reed!

369
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,161
Reed! Reed!

370
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,537
- Help!
- Sue?

371
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,164
I'm on fire!

372
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,001
- Sue! What's going on?
- I'm on fire!

373
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,211
- You're on fire!
- You think?

374
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,505
- Hold on!
- Pull me in!

375
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,635
Hey, it's the Human Torch!

376
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,220
Johnny!

377
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,890
- I'm not Johnny!
- Sue, how did this happen?

378
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,601
L touched Johnny, and then this.

379
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,686
- Where is Johnny?
- Here.

380
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,189
Try it again.

381
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,945
- Nice.
- There you go.

382
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,989
Hey, get out of there.

383
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,033
Sue, your clothes.

384
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,329
Why does this always happen to me?

385
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,707
All of Sue's results are normal.

386
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,542
But Johnny's....

387
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,377
Johnny's are what?

388
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:35,716
Your encounter with the Surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux.

389
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,929
Ls that bad?

390
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,641
Lt caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

391
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,644
- I'd like to run more tests and...
- Want a volunteer?

392
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,937
- No, no, hey!
- No, no, no!

393
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,397
No, no, hey! This is serious!

394
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,817
L just wanted to give him a hug.

395
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,985
We don't know the extent
of his condition.

396
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,821
Lt could be progressive.

397
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,989
- lt could be fun.
- No, Ben!

398
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,241
Ben!

399
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,161
Hey. Hey, it's me! I'm back!

400
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,256
Oh, my God!

401
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,343
Come on!
We just said this is serious!

402
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,178
Oh, yeah, serious.

403
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,391
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

404
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,187
- Hey, not bad.
- Incredible.

405
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,440
- You better be able to fix this!
- I'm right on it.

406
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,361
- Ben, stop it!
- L see why you like that.

407
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,447
Oh, no, no, no.

408
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,451
Crap.

409
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,705
That's not funny. What am l
supposed to do in the meantime?

410
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,457
Just try to keep
your distance from us.

411
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:57,047
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal!

412
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,102
My inside sources tell me
unlucky bride-to-be Sue Storm...

413
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,063
turned invisible
and is staying that way...

414
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,733
after yesterday's
embarrassing fiasco.

415
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:19,737
Next, the Invisible Woman's
greatest fashion blunders...

416
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:24,241
and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist Reed Richards.

417
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,537
Why do you keep watching this?
Just ignore it.

418
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:31,916
L can't ignore it, Reed.
There's no getting away from it!

419
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,126
- l believe there is.
- How?

420
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,130
See? No answer.

421
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,802
Yes, there is.

422
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,764
What if, after this crisis is over...

423
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,977
- ...we leave it all behind?
- What are you talking about?

424
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,480
We move out of the Baxter Building.

425
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,857
I'll take a teaching position
somewhere.

426
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,943
Get back to my research.

427
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,697
The two of us will live our lives
and raise a family, like normal people.

428
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,741
You would do that?

429
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,745
Nothing is more important to me
than our future together.

430
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,539
Oh, thank you.

431
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,006
What about Ben and Johnny?

432
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,050
They'll understand.

433
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,679
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

434
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,348
Let's not mention it to them yet.

435
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,727
Johnny's got enough to worry about
as it is, with his power problems.

436
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,705
You've been busy, my friend.

437
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,124
Your talents are impressive.

438
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,921
Can you understand what I'm saying?

439
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,302
Together, we could be unstoppable.

440
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,930
Anything would be ours for the taking.

441
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,476
All that you know is at an end.

442
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,104
What do you mean by that?

443
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:02,107
Wait! l said, wait!

444
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,385
They're breaking up the team.
Reed and Sue, l overheard them.

445
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,721
They want a nice, normal,
boring-ass life.

446
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,099
- No more Fantastic Four.
- Well...

447
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,060
what do we do?
Keep going, just the two of us?

448
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,979
And call ourselves what?
The Dynamic Duo?

449
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,440
When were they gonna tell us?

450
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,901
They'll tell you when they're ready.

451
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,237
Lt's their decision, not yours.

452
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,949
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

453
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,618
Guys.

454
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,204
We've got a serious problem.

455
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:02,126
L cross-referenced the Surfer's radiation
through every astronomical database.

456
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,629
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

457
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,757
- He's been to all these planets?
- And now they're lifeless.

458
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,301
Barren. Some even shattered.

459
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:15,430
Everywhere the Surfer goes,
eight days later, the planet dies.

460
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,269
How are we gonna stop him?

461
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,063
We don't even know where he is.

462
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,359
What about the craters?

463
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,992
They appear in a numerical sequence.

464
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,911
The last crater was formed
in Greenland...

465
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,039
so the next in the sequence
should be...

466
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,126
latitude 51 degrees,
30 minutes north...

467
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,672
longitude zero degrees,
seven minutes west.

468
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,438
When he surfaces, move the fight
away from the crowd.

469
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,733
He's too fast to contain.
When l see silver, I'm hitting him!

470
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,819
You can't do that. We stick to the plan
and work as a team.

471
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,738
Oh, we're a team now?
News to me.

472
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,741
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

473
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:16,950
We were gonna tell you.

474
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:21,288
- When? When you moved our stuff out?
- Johnny, this isn't a good time.

475
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,749
Kid's got a point, Reed.
You should have told us.

476
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,335
That's enough!
We'll talk about this later.

477
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,379
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

478
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,512
Lt's a whirlpool!

479
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,181
Oh, my God.

480
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,981
What is that?

481
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,333
Get out! Get out!

482
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,063
Don't let go!

483
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,159
- Move!
- Come on! Go!

484
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,386
No, Johnny!

485
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,783
Guys? What are you doing?

486
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,585
Ben! Lift it higher!

487
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,003
I'll try.

488
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,119
Sue!

489
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,504
Stay back,
before you get somebody killed.

490
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,217
Oh, my God.

491
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,572
What the hell was that?

492
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,325
We'll make adjustments.
Next time, we'll be ready.

493
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,662
Next time? There's no next time.

494
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,916
You can't handle this alone.
I'm bringing in help.

495
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,087
Bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger.

496
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,464
No more than you already have.

497
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:05,929
Victor?

498
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,099
What's the matter?
Afraid of ghosts?

499
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,019
- Look out!
- Don't move!

500
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:17,232
Since you're a ghost,
you won't mind if l break your neck.

501
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,025
- Let him go.
- You know who that is?

502
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,028
Victor von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

503
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,537
Ben, let him go.

504
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,542
How is this possible?

505
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,546
How are you still alive?

506
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,591
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

507
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:47,304
Von Doom's made contact with the
alien. He's got valuable information.

508
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,557
Information that might just
help save the planet.

509
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,642
Now let's be clear about this...

510
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,562
shall we? l hate you.

511
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,733
All of you.

512
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:05,405
But the world's at stake and we
need to work together to survive.

513
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:10,494
General, we know firsthand, you trust
Victor and you're gonna regret it.

514
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:14,831
So far, the only one I've regretted
trusting here is you, Richards.

515
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,835
Reed, don't agree to this.

516
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,134
Let's see what he's got.

517
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,846
L made a detailed recording
of our little encounter.

518
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,058
All that you know is at an end.

519
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,354
Well?

520
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:40,649
L like the part where
he knocks you on your ass.

521
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:47,280
Look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me.

522
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,618
There? See what happened?

523
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:58,166
The energy was channeled through him,
but it originated from his board.

524
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:02,837
If we can separate him from the board,
we can cut off his power completely.

525
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,549
- That's what we have to do.
- How?

526
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:09,094
If l knew that,
l wouldn't need you people, would l?

527
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,057
You two should
get started right away.

528
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:23,233
I'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

529
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,279
I'll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up.

530
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,371
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

531
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:40,667
You got me. Things were simpler
when l could just whale on the guy.

532
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,461
What's he doing? A fire.

533
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,338
Look at that.

534
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,802
I'll pay for that.

535
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:55,849
I'll tell you, Ben, I'm starting
to feel like a complete screw-up.

536
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,727
Hey, hey, you're not
a complete screw-up.

537
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,020
Thank you.

538
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:04,608
Look, kid, it's out of our hands.
Lt's up to the eggheads now.

539
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:09,112
You think Reed's right about
the whole end-of-the-world thing?

540
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,991
He's never been wrong
about this kind of thing before.

541
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,244
You know, I'm not exactly
a deep kind of guy.

542
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,537
Really?

543
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,916
But if Reed's right, and this is it...

544
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,423
how do you want
to spend your last few minutes?

545
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,301
Part of me would like
to go out fighting.

546
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,555
But the truth is...

547
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,726
I'd like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding Alicia.

548
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,647
That sounds pretty good.

549
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,734
L mean, not the "holding Alicia" thing.
She's your girlfriend, not mine.

550
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,487
Want nothing to do with her.
Not to say she's not attractive.

551
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:54,032
She's very attractive.
She's so attractive.

552
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:58,370
Even with the... l can't think of
a guy that wouldn't want to...

553
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,915
What l meant...

554
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,126
was that it's nice
to have somebody.

555
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,881
Well, you got me, pal.

556
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,148
How's it going?

557
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,067
L can't find a link.

558
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,778
- It'll be all right.
- No, it won't!

559
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,073
The whole world's
counting on me, and l just....

560
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,576
Reed, you're gonna find the answer.

561
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,370
- You always do.
- Thanks, Sue.

562
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,330
- You just need to relax.
- Yeah, right.

563
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,542
You do. Reed, you need to relax.

564
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,628
Take a deep breath.

565
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,964
Slower.

566
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,216
There you go.

567
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,469
Come on. Again.

568
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,892
See? l can already
feel your pulse slowing down.

569
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,148
- Do you remember that time...?
- A pulse.

570
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,402
A tachyon pulse.

571
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,529
L love you.

572
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:16,906
I'm glad l could help.

573
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:40,054
So exactly how does this thing work?

574
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,224
When we activate the field,
it'll separate him from his board...

575
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,519
- ...making him powerless.
- Like a fish in a net.

576
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,521
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

577
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,233
- In theory, anyway.
- How long until it's operational?

578
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,360
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

579
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,906
L can only go so fast,
since I'm working by myself.

580
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,701
- What do you need to make this happen?
- There are a couple of things.

581
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:05,038
Do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing?

582
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,008
What are you doing?

583
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,304
- Don't you knock?
- You're supposed to be helping Reed.

584
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,806
Tell him not to worry.

585
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:27,227
I'll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him.

586
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,316
- Anything else?
- How'd you do it?

587
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,238
How did you come back?

588
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,576
Lt scares you, doesn't it?

589
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,997
The things l can do.

590
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,125
Did you know l could create
a force field inside someone's body...

591
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,920
and expand it until they explode?

592
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,297
Give it your best shot.

593
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,637
Just get back to the lab.

594
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,688
Mr. Storm?

595
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,567
We're heading to intercept the Surfer
in 1 0 minutes, with or without you.

596
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:20,280
Were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

597
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,789
That was a joke. l was joking.

598
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,626
Why are you so down on me?
You don't even know me.

599
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:37,213
L know you very well.
L read your personality profile.

600
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,091
Confident. Reckless. irresponsible.

601
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,844
Self-obsessed,
bordering on narcissism.

602
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:45,221
Okay, so you do know me.

603
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,808
All I've seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed.

604
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,019
Okay.

605
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,772
I've been a little off my game lately.

606
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,108
This is not a game.

607
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,708
- Sir, he's in position north of here.
- Good.

608
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,794
- General, give us a one-mile perimeter.
- Forget it, Richards.

609
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:20,048
You had your shot and you blew it.
This is a military operation now.

610
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:23,676
Jam the signal, get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

611
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,930
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

612
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,016
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks.

613
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,019
I'm the quarterback.
You're on my team.

614
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:34,979
Got it?

615
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:40,360
But l guess you never played football
in high school, did you, Richards?

616
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,696
No, you're right, l didn't.

617
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:47,200
L stayed in and studied,
like a good little nerd.

618
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,620
And fifteen years later...

619
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,831
I'm one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century.

620
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,960
I'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

621
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:00,088
And the jock who played quarterback
in high school...

622
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:03,383
is right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

623
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,719
And l say he's not gonna
get a damn thing...

624
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,931
unless he does exactly
what l tell him to...

625
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,726
and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect.

626
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,737
Give him what he wants.

627
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,992
L am so hot for you right now.

628
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,536
- Me too.
- Be careful, Johnny.

629
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,205
All right, let's go to work.

630
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,342
This is it.

631
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,180
You have your coordinates. Set up
your posts and rendezvous back here.

632
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,986
First squad, move out!

633
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:42,065
Hey. You scared me there, Smokey.
Look at you. You're cute.

634
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,325
Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo Boo.

635
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,578
Overgrown furball.

636
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,749
- What's our status?
- Yeah. I'm good to go.

637
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,918
- Same here.
- Almost there.

638
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,014
Guys?

639
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:18,059
- We have a problem.
- What's wrong?

640
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,644
He's here.

641
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,064
Get out of there, right now!

642
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:48,089
Why are you destroying our planet?

643
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,842
L have no choice.

644
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,969
- Sue!
- Wait!

645
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:58,975
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

646
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,060
There's always a choice.

647
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,771
Not always.

648
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:08,025
Why are you trying to destroy us?

649
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,154
L am not the Destroyer.

650
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:14,949
Come on, Richards.
Jam the damn signal.

651
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,577
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

652
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,581
- Fire one over the top.
- Roger, out.

653
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,096
- Open fire.
- Open fire.

654
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,432
Open fire! Repeat, open fire!

655
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,609
Fall back! Fall back!

656
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,947
- Let me just...
- No, wait!

657
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,909
Reed.

658
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:00,661
Come on, Sue.

659
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,748
All right, it's up.

660
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,333
Reed.

661
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,126
Got him.

662
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:35,488
Not so tough now, are you?

663
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,957
Victor! Stay back!

664
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,418
You're the quarterback.

665
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,188
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

666
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,108
- Perimeter secure!
- Move him out.

667
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,492
- Open the gate!
- Get him to the debriefing room.

668
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,923
- We had an agreement.
- Calm down.

669
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:37,925
The enemy has been captured.

670
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,969
- Where is he?
- Contained.

671
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,929
General?

672
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,182
Mr. Sherman.

673
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,895
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

674
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,399
- l want to be there for the questioning.
- Not gonna happen.

675
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,527
Make sure our guests remain here,
comfortably.

676
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,571
Yes, sir.

677
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,783
General, what about the board?

678
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:06,495
Lt's in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal.

679
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,390
There are certain things
I'm not permitted to do...

680
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:29,685
because they're considered
human-rights violations.

681
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,355
Fortunately, you're not human.

682
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,946
Are we prisoners?

683
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,990
How did that happen?

684
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,827
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

685
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,288
L can't imagine what
they're doing to him.

686
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,541
- l say he gets what he deserves.
- How can you say that?

687
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,544
I'm just saying maybe
the general's right about this.

688
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,714
The guy was about to destroy
the planet. He said so himself.

689
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,594
Lt doesn't make sense. He protected me
from the missile. Why would he do that?

690
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,137
Maybe he thinks you're cute.

691
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,766
There's more going on.
He said he wasn't the Destroyer.

692
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:10,935
Maybe he lied?

693
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:17,274
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

694
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,735
But under the radar.

695
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:27,410
Ls there any way
we could get some DVDs...

696
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,495
or popcorn or something?

697
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,288
- I'll call it in.
- Great.

698
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,040
Thank you. Semper fi.

699
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,835
That's the Marine Corps.
We're the Army.

700
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,587
Right, l know it's the Army.

701
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,888
Captain Raye. Access granted.

702
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,697
General.

703
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,450
Von Doom wants to speak with you.

704
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:11,203
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

705
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,081
Mr. Sherman, let's take a break.

706
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,226
L know you are there.

707
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,282
What's your name?

708
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,828
Come on, you must have a name.

709
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,788
I'm Susan.

710
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:03,923
You said you weren't the one trying
to destroy our world. Then who is?

711
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:07,218
- The one l serve.
- Who do you serve?

712
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:14,767
I'm trying to help you, but to do that,
you have to tell me the truth.

713
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,727
Please.

714
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,575
Lt is known by many names.
My people called it...

715
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,119
Galactus...

716
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,872
the Devourer of Worlds.

717
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:43,003
Lt must feed on energy to survive.

718
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,631
Both thermal...

719
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:47,341
and organic.

720
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,134
How can you serve this thing?

721
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,553
Because l must.

722
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:55,683
Doesn't it bother you, all the worlds and
innocent people you've helped destroy?

723
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:58,686
My service spares my world...

724
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,273
and the one l love.

725
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:07,152
Why did you try to protect me?

726
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,738
Because...

727
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,534
you remind me of her.

728
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:31,010
Could you stop the Destroyer
if you wanted to?

729
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:34,930
Lt is not l who draws the Destroyer here.
Lt is the beacon.

730
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,932
What's the beacon?

731
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,934
The source of my power.

732
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,894
Your board?

733
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,985
Take joy in the last few hours
you have left...

734
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,946
for he is nearly here.

735
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:11,592
Well? l helped deliver
the alien to you, as promised.

736
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:15,054
Now it's time to keep
your end of the bargain.

737
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:18,432
You can do your tests on the board...

738
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,770
but under armed guard
and in my presence only.

739
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:24,855
Absolutely.

740
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,657
General Hager. Access granted.

741
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,015
The board draws it here.

742
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,142
How do you fight something
that eats planets?

743
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:05,020
We have to get to the board
and lead it away from here.

744
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:08,524
Well, do you think the general
will go for that?

745
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,900
He'll have no choice.

746
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,947
Thank you, general.

747
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,366
But I'm afraid...

748
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,618
the truth is...

749
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:22,121
sometimes Reed is right.

750
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:27,084
What...?

751
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:41,640
Hey, you. Come here.

752
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,268
Let me ask you something.

753
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:47,664
Nice.

754
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:53,921
Crap.

755
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,054
Ben!

756
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,393
Okay, that one hurt.

757
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,772
- Where's Reed?
- Back here.

758
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,326
My bad.

759
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,418
Reed.

760
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:40,592
Victor. We've gotta get it back.

761
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,846
We need to get the Surfer.
He understands its power.

762
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:48,600
Even if we break him out of this place,
how are we gonna catch up to Victor?

763
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:50,978
Leave that to me.

764
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,926
- Halt!
- Stay where you are!

765
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,391
Pal, this is the luckiest day
of your life.

766
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:36,398
What the hell is going on?
Where is General Hager?

767
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,608
He's dead.

768
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:40,444
And if we don't get him out of here,
we'll all be.

769
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:41,862
Frankie...

770
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:48,076
the world is literally at stake here.
You have to trust us.

771
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,538
Please.

772
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,586
We need to get to the roof.
Lt should be here by now.

773
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,504
What should be here?

774
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,390
Holy crap!

775
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:12,392
Reed.

776
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:16,229
This is by far the coolest thing
you have ever done.

777
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,199
- Hemi?
- Of course.

778
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,286
Okay, Ben, you get inside.
Johnny, you fly behind us.

779
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:34,790
- You gotta let me fly this.
- I'm the best pilot. l should drive.

780
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,084
- Guys.
- You're lucky if it can carry you.

781
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:39,252
- l can fly circles around you.
- Guys!

782
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:42,089
- Reed.
- Shut up! And move it!

783
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,508
I'm driving.

784
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:48,845
Flame on!

785
01:11:55,812 --> 01:12:00,440
Okay. We're now officially enemies
of the United States of America.

786
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,402
Victor is out there somewhere
with unlimited power.

787
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,113
And we've got a giant
intergalactic force...

788
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,034
that's about to destroy our planet in
less than 24 hours. Did l miss anything?

789
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:15,664
I've locked on Victor's energy trail.
He's headed over Southeast China.

790
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,082
Hang on.

791
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,005
Norrin Radd.

792
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:28,927
- What?
- L was once called Norrin Radd.

793
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:32,931
Norrin, we'll need your help
to save our world.

794
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:34,683
Do you understand?

795
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,816
What the hell was that?

796
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:48,238
Victor, the board is drawing the
Destroyer here. You have to give it up.

797
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:51,074
You know, I've never
been the giving type, Reed.

798
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:52,576
Hold on!

799
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,175
We're sitting ducks!

800
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:09,843
We're gonna have to split up!

801
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:12,054
- What?
- This ought to be fun!

802
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,473
Stay close to me, Sue!

803
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,169
He's really pissing me off!

804
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:52,010
Surf's up, metalhead!

805
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:59,851
Victor, only the Surfer can stop the
Destroyer. But he needs his board.

806
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,604
- Come and get it, Richards.
- Victor.

807
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,653
Let's all go for a spin!

808
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,110
Norrin!

809
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:53,780
Catch.

810
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:09,754
Sue!

811
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,303
Oh, my God.

812
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,762
Sue. Sue.

813
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:20,932
- Oh, God.
- Johnny, don't touch her!

814
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,021
Oh, God. Oh, God.

815
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,106
You need to find a way
to get the board.

816
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:30,108
- Sue, l....
- Okay.

817
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,493
He is here.

818
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:49,878
Reed?

819
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,505
Reed.

820
01:15:53,925 --> 01:15:57,385
Victor's gotta have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

821
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:01,056
We take it out,
we can separate him from his board.

822
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,182
He's too strong for me.

823
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:04,893
L could whale on him if l get close...

824
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:08,188
but he could see me coming
from a mile away.

825
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,107
Lt would take all of us.

826
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:14,653
Or maybe just one of us.

827
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,618
We don't know
what it could do to you.

828
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,412
Let's not make this about me.

829
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:48,186
To quote a friend of mine...

830
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,480
it's clobbering time.

831
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:49,539
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

832
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,083
Not without me.

833
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:31,599
You've gotta go.

834
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,299
Treasure each moment with her.

835
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:07,093
And tell her she was right.

836
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:10,555
We do have a choice.

837
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,626
Thought you could use a hand.

838
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:45,507
Oh, my God.

839
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,955
Why isn't it working?

840
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,958
We were too late.

841
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:30,677
L will no longer serve.

842
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:36,766
This is the end for us both.

843
01:22:59,391 --> 01:22:59,891
Hi.

844
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,610
What did l miss?

845
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,537
Hey! Hey!

846
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:23,915
- He did it.
- Great job, kid.

847
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:29,128
Hey, wait. I'm not changing.

848
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:31,047
Hey, that's right.

849
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,007
Great.

850
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:36,969
Okay, now you're making
me uncomfortable.

851
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:58,783
So l guess this is it.

852
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,828
We all go our separate ways.

853
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:03,663
No.

854
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:06,207
- No?
- No.

855
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,167
- No?
- If not for the team...

856
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:09,836
the whole world would be gone.

857
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,549
We can't run away from our
responsibilities. This is who we are.

858
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:17,802
- That's what I've been saying.
- What about having a normal life?

859
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,727
- A family?
- Who says you have to be normal...

860
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,639
to have a family?

861
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:27,478
So are you up for another media-circus
wedding? Fifth time's a charm.

862
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,480
No.

863
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,735
L got a better idea.

864
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:50,251
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Reed Richards...

865
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:53,463
and Sue Storm together in holy...

866
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,965
matrimony.

867
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,385
- What is it?
- Venice is sinking into the Adriatic.

868
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,554
Oh, boy. That's a biggie.

869
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,806
Could we just skip to the end?

870
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:07,769
- Yeah. The love these two share...
- No, the very end.

871
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,521
Yeah, great. You have the rings?

872
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,448
Oh, yeah.

873
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:24,368
L now pronounce you man and wife,
and you may kiss the bride.

874
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,461
- Okay. We should get out of here.
- Yeah.

875
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,421
- Gotta go, hon.
- Okay.

876
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,553
L have to throw the bouquet.

877
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:44,055
Ready?

878
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:55,149
Heads up, Johnny.

879
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:07,036
Sorry.

880
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,039
Reflex.
