1
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:30,822
I used to hide what my
vagina did to my underpants.

2
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:34,117
And, by the way, what all vaginas
do to all underpants, okay?

3
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:38,287
There is no woman who ends her day
with, like, a clean pair of underpants

4
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,416
that look like they've ever
even come from a store, okay?

5
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:45,336
They look like little bags
that have fallen face down

6
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,256
in, like, a tub of cream cheese,

7
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:52,593
and then, like,
commando-crawled their way out.

8
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,054
And then, like, carabinered up,
like, into a crotch.

9
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,935
Like, they're not items
that are for anyone to see.

10
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,938
But now, I'm just like, "Whatever."

11
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,774
You know, I have a human vagina.

12
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,946
Okay, who here just saw my face

13
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:16,200
and thought that they were at
a bagel store in a synagogue?

14
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,286
Who thought that?

15
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,206
Who stared at my face and
thought that I'm the product of

16
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,584
if a menorah fucked
Natalie Imbruglia?

17
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,297
But the menorah, like, had me.
You know what I mean?

18
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,549
You know, like when two
lesbians have a baby,

19
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,009
and everyone's like, "They did it!"

20
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,678
And they're like,
"But it's really Karen's.

21
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,222
"It's gonna be husky."

22
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,143
You guys are like,
"You're a horrible woman."

23
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,437
But let me tell you,
I agree. I agree.

24
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,317
I, surprisingly,
am not alone in my life.

25
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,902
I have a boyfriend.

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,613
Yeah, he's cool.

27
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,657
He's got a, you know, working dick.

28
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,453
Yeah, he's a human male.
I'll put it that way.

29
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:05,708
But I'm still honking down
on that D when I need to.

30
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,502
Literally, only when I need to.

31
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,337
Like, it's not that I
don't like doing it.

32
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,673
It's just that, after a while,
it just becomes a step towards,

33
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,176
like, getting rhythmically banged out

34
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,387
until your worries can go away,
and you can pass out for eight hours.

35
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,556
That's sort of where we're at.

36
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,101
Functional. Functional, you know.
We've worked out all the kinks.

37
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:29,023
Man, I think I just heard
his heart stop beating.

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,653
When we first started dating,
my butthole was so scared,

39
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,614
you know, that it might, like,
lose the chance at romance,

40
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,867
that it was just like, "Everyone,
shut down," and it was like...

41
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,038
But then when he would, like,
leave my apartment, I would be like,

42
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,706
"Good night,"

43
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,960
and pretend to be so confident in
everything that just happened.

44
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,044
Even though I was like,

45
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,881
"Was that cool when I did that?
Was that cool when I did that?"

46
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:58,385
Then I would just masturbate to
my worries until he came back.

47
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:05,934
I would just shut the door and, like, stand
there for a minute and then just be like...

48
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,522
"No, no, no. Don't you
be your old self."

49
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,691
And then it would be like,
"But it feels so good. I gotta..."

50
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,610
That's my butthole's voice.
"I gotta be me!

51
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,821
"I gotta be me!"

52
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,406
And then it would just be like...

53
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,287
That's me walking up my stairs.

54
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,166
Anyone need a barf bag?

55
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,798
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetie.

56
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,800
- How's it going?
- Good.

57
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,595
Am I having a stroke, or does
this soap smell like popcorn?

58
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,598
- You're not having a stroke.
- Good.

59
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,226
It just smells like your hand,
you know. Smells normal.

60
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,520
A couple of other people
are going to another bar,

61
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,148
and I know that you don't
like leaving the radius,

62
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,401
but I really wanna go and have, like,
one, two, one million more drinks.

63
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,820
Yeah, I don't think I can go.

64
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,407
Okay. Do you wanna just go home,
and we can finish that documentary about...

65
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,786
Things have been kind of fucked
up between us lately, you know?

66
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,794
And then you go, and you
talk about it up there.

67
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,632
It's just a very weird
feeling for me.

68
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,550
Are you still mad at
me about last night?

69
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,427
- No.
- 'Cause I told you that I didn't feel well,

70
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,305
because I ate street meat
from the cart at work.

71
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,850
And also, you just said you didn't do
the thing that I wanna do, and I'm not...

72
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,018
I've been sleeping with Kate.

73
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,897
What?

74
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,318
You know, we can't
lie to you anymore.

75
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,072
You're, like, a we?
You guys are a we? No.

76
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,536
I wanted to tell you sooner.

77
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:52,625
But you're here all the time.
Your schedule is all over the place.

78
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,877
We never talk or anything!

79
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,380
I'm at your house every other night.

80
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,760
Why are you... Stop looking at your
phone while you're dumping me!

81
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,845
Is she calling you? Is she asking you,
"Have you dumped her yet?"

82
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,972
No.

83
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,723
- Or are you just such a dick...
- Sorry.

84
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,892
...that you're looking at your
phone while you're dumping me?

85
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,394
I just don't know where to look.

86
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:16,273
You don't know where to look?
Well, this is probably a good area.

87
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,067
Hi, Ryan.

88
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:06,573
I don't know if you're getting my
messages, but I really need to talk.

89
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,495
I'm sorry. I didn't hear the...

90
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,332
I don't care about the beep!

91
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:20,754
I am also sorry that you
cannot get to the phone!

92
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,348
Kate has HPV.

93
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,727
The kind of HPV where you
get warts on your stuff

94
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,231
and ovarian cancer.

95
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,485
There's a lot of other stuff
I could say, but I'm a lady.

96
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:46,739
Yeah, and then she dies of cancer,
and you're stuck with the bill, so...

97
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,535
I just wanted to apologize for the voicemail
that I just left on your voicemail.

98
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,746
And I also wanted to say, "Psych!"

99
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,833
Have a great life!

100
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:03,338
I'll be here with my normal HPV
that one in four nice women have.

101
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,802
And there will not be an apology message
for this apology message. Goodbye.

102
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,495
- You okay?
- Nellie!

103
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,499
You look like a lez who just
got back from Birthright.

104
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,583
Move.

105
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,128
These clogs are yours.

106
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,338
Ryan always hated my clogs.

107
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,216
Well, I guess that doesn't
matter anymore, huh?

108
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,968
You got my texts?

109
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,387
I did do. I'm sorry.

110
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,182
Do you want to talk about it?

111
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,976
Okay.

112
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,395
You're in shock. We don't
have to talk about it.

113
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,856
I always thought that Ryan
was attracted to Kate,

114
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,151
but then I just told myself I
was being insecure and jealous.

115
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,361
And now, all my worst
fears have come true.

116
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,571
That's not what happened.

117
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,991
What happened is he's a piece
of shit, and she's a little bitch.

118
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,993
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

119
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,579
Come on up here.

120
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,873
- You know I'd take a bullet for you, right?
- I know.

121
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,667
- Right into my heart.
- I know.

122
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,863
Nellie, you're so sweet
and nice and pretty.

123
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:26,130
Okay.

124
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,049
You gonna be okay? Do you want
me to sleep in here with you?

125
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,887
I can't do that to you, because I'm
about to turn this bed into a fart pod.

126
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,306
Okay.

127
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,309
That sounds too cozy for me.

128
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,353
- All right, I love you.
- I love you.

129
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,325
- Donna.
- Shit, Gene.

130
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,744
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

131
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:01,081
No, I'm sorry. I haven't
been sleeping very well.

132
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,250
Listen, Donna,

133
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,628
there's something that I
need to talk to you about.

134
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,755
No, no, no. I already called
the plumber. We're just...

135
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,590
We're all gonna have to
use the bathroom on Sixth

136
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,801
- for, like, a few days.
- It's not that. It's...

137
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,263
Well, there's no easy
way to spit this out.

138
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:22,102
The landlord's kicking us out.
We have six weeks.

139
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,270
What?

140
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,356
They're closing the store.

141
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:29,276
That's crazy! That's disgusting!
This place is like a New York institution!

142
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,111
You've been here five years.

143
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,613
I've been here for 30.

144
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,700
Sometimes we just have to let
go of the things we love.

145
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,621
That's really easy for you to say,
'cause you're gonna move to Woodstock,

146
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:45,167
and, like, buy a bunch of wick and
candles and just, like, chill out all day.

147
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,003
Hey, that sounds pretty nice.
I think I will do that.

148
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,006
Listen, change is good, Donna.

149
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,469
Man, that's, like, the rudest
thing you've ever said to me.

150
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,769
You know, that Ryan,
he was not a gentleman.

151
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,772
Okay. Well, I'm gonna call him right now,
and I'm gonna tell him that you said that.

152
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,774
You're not gonna waste
one valuable moment

153
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,068
of your young precious
life mourning that boy.

154
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,569
I'm a mess.

155
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,447
I can't even be in public
without bursting into tears.

156
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,366
And I think I've cried
on every train line.

157
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,450
Oh, baby.

158
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,954
You know, when your mom and I
split up, I thought my life was over.

159
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,998
You know what saved me?

160
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,292
A long walk with your Uncle Jim.

161
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,421
We walked, we talked, and we
talked about life, and spirituality,

162
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,299
and identity and racism.

163
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,134
And by the time the sun came up,

164
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,429
- we had the premise for our first TV show.
- "We had the premise for our first TV show."

165
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,347
We did.

166
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,600
- That smells good.
- Pasghetti.

167
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,687
- Your favorite sauce, extra honey.
- Extra honey.

168
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,814
I can eat this.

169
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:54,903
You know, creative energy sometimes
comes from the lowest point in your life.

170
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:59,199
But, Dad, you had a partner
to do all of that with.

171
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,703
I'm just up there alone by
myself just beating myself up.

172
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:07,958
Well, negativity will either be your
best friend or your worst enemy.

173
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,502
How do you want to
approach your fears?

174
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,546
Tylenol PM.

175
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,132
No. Living.

176
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,052
Living is the best revenge.

177
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,180
So eat up, and then when we're finished,
you're gonna go visit your mom.

178
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,806
She's worried about you.

179
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,058
You guys need to know

180
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,810
there are some children out there who
don't talk to their parents for months.

181
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,063
- Like, even on the telephone.
- Really? Really?

182
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,564
Not my child.

183
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,359
- Okay.
- Thank you.

184
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,779
You're an aberration.

185
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,614
You're all wrong.

186
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,490
You're the weird one.

187
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,578
You're so pretty. Now just
hold up, just for a second.

188
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,081
- Are you proud of me?
- I'm very proud of you.

189
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,432
You know, an ex-student of
mine started a temp agency.

190
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,227
They specialize in placing people
in the entertainment world.

191
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,561
Pass the duck sauce.

192
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,689
You're about to lose your income.
You don't seem the least bit concerned.

193
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,192
I'm terrified, Mom.
Believe me, I very much am.

194
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,278
But I'm not going to work for one
of your business school students.

195
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,448
You're almost 30 years old. You still
don't know how to do your taxes.

196
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:26,745
I'm a couple of years away from 30,
and nobody knows how to do their taxes.

197
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,040
Have you spoken to your agent
about booking any commercial work?

198
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,960
You know, I haven't, because recently,
she put her entire body into her oven.

199
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,673
You're never serious.

200
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,426
I will use TurboTax this year, okay?

201
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,636
Hand me the plate.

202
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,099
Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but
I'm in kind of an emotional crisis right now.

203
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,892
I know you're going through
some pain right now,

204
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,145
but you're always gonna be
going through something.

205
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,354
I haven't borrowed money
from you in months.

206
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,149
And I just did that commercial
for the organic douche,

207
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,067
which is gonna be a
real boon to my image.

208
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,486
Well, I'm glad you did the douche job.
The douche paid well.

209
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,155
Definitely, stop saying "douche."

210
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,741
There are other things in your life you could
afford to be a little more selective about.

211
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,493
Your next beau, for example.

212
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:11,123
I'll never forget that brunch
when he told us his SAT scores.

213
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,668
Mom, really, a lot of people
aren't good test-takers.

214
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,546
You were. And now you
waste that 780 verbal

215
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,632
on telling jokes about having
diarrhea in your pants.

216
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,859
Fuck it.

217
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,991
I'll take three more sips,

218
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,036
and if he doesn't come
out, then I'll go.

219
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,478
I'll take two more sips, actually.

220
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:21,151
And if the lady in the tan jacket
crosses the street on the second sip,

221
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,487
then that means that
I should go home.

222
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,835
Motherfucker.

223
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:48,053
What are you doing? What am I doing?

224
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,181
Just go home to your house.

225
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,768
Fuck!

226
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,613
They have a fucking dog.

227
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,490
What were you doing?

228
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,951
Just out doing some light stalking.

229
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,578
No!

230
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,454
What is wrong with me?

231
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:18,249
Nothing. Nothing is wrong with you.

232
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,043
How did I not know?

233
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,004
Those two are sociopaths.

234
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,340
This is my fault.

235
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,094
I never should have talked about
our relationship in my act.

236
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,806
No, fuck that noise. You know
what is so great about you?

237
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,142
I'm good at folding the laundry?

238
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,185
No, sweetie, you're terrible
at folding the laundry.

239
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,812
What is so great about you is that

240
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,648
you are unapologetically yourself
on that stage every time,

241
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,650
and that's why people love you.

242
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,319
Listen, I'm not gonna let

243
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,822
that mouth-breather and fucking
bag of bones bring you down.

244
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,077
- She's actually my target weight.
- That is gross.

245
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,944
I guess comedy is
supposed to be honest.

246
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:27,903
So let me just tell you
a little bit about me.

247
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,614
As they say, I like my men
the way I like my coffee.

248
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,575
Disgusting,

249
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,871
like, very weak and bitter,

250
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,500
and cold, not sweet at all.

251
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,879
Very gritty on the bottom as well.
If you know coffee like that,

252
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,465
I'm just like, "What is your number?"

253
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,011
And now that we're all picturing
a very filthy bottom,

254
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,390
I think it's time to
bring one to the stage.

255
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,725
And she's my best friend
in the entire world.

256
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,561
I think you guys are gonna
love her just as much as I do.

257
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,398
Everyone, please welcome Donna Stern!

258
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,693
Yeah!

259
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,862
Here we go.

260
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,156
- Everything cool?
- No.

261
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,119
I love that guy.

262
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,373
Okay. I was in the bathroom

263
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,210
'cause that is all that I have left.

264
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,338
Does it count as exercise

265
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:34,136
if you are just squeezing your body
all the time super-hard, super-tight,

266
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,846
'cause you're just crying so hard?

267
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,764
Does that make sense to any of you?

268
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,600
That was a rhetorical question.

269
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,228
I should probably turn around, right?

270
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,312
No shit!

271
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,398
Okay. All right.

272
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,235
"No shit" yourself, sir.
It's a swear. Rude.

273
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:57,200
In case you can't tell from my
deep, deep ridges on my face,

274
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:04,875
I was recently dumped up with by
a human male who is still alive.

275
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:08,044
So, good for him.

276
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,673
I feel like when someone does
something bad, they should just die.

277
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:17,345
But instead, we die a slow death
and watch their happiness bloom.

278
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,810
Doctor's orders.

279
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:35,322
My very nice close friend
who's such a nice person

280
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,949
decided to fuck my boyfriend.

281
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,869
I would love to just
murder-suicide them.

282
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,038
A lot of people say I
look like Anne Frank.

283
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,999
I would never have survived
the Holocaust. That's for sure.

284
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,335
If you were cool, this could be art.

285
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,212
Or if I were cool.

286
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,923
Is this not working for you?
Do you want your money back?

287
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,090
'Cause the show is free.

288
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,676
I want my life back, but I can't
get it back 'cause it's ruined.

289
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,762
So that is a cost I have incurred.

290
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,765
I'll share more. I'll share more.
You guys seem to be fucking loving it.

291
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,310
Full-blown affair, you know?
Like, who is she? Like, Faye Dunaway?

292
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,020
You know what I mean?
It's, like, "Cool move."

293
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,731
This kind of thing makes you think
I'm pretty good at fucking, right?

294
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,401
It's 'cause she's one of those
fucking girls with a thread count.

295
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:18,073
This place is a fucking shithole.
So I'm really glad to be on your roster.

296
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,535
She's just going up and
down on his dick so slowly

297
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,996
so that he knows exactly
how blonde her pussy is.

298
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,958
Then I just come in,
and I murder-sui everything,

299
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,294
and then she gets
stains on her sheets.

300
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,300
But anyhow...

301
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,846
- That was the worst.
- It wasn't that bad.

302
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,350
Okay, don't get me wrong.
It was horrible.

303
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,811
But it wasn't the worst
comedy I've ever seen.

304
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,189
That was not comedy.
That was not even a performance.

305
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,233
That was not even performance art.

306
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,652
I think a lot of people learned a
lot about the Holocaust tonight.

307
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,407
You know what the saddest thing
about this whole terrible story is?

308
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,703
It's that not only did Kate fuck my
boyfriend and ruin that area of my life,

309
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,912
but now I can't even do standup,

310
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,290
which was the one thing about me
that made me better than her.

311
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,917
I hate how much you're focusing
on Kate in all of this.

312
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,753
If you're about to defend her right now,
I'm gonna turn into a pile of dust.

313
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,548
All I'm saying is, like, she didn't
trick Ryan into fucking her.

314
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,591
He's a fucking asshole.

315
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:24,764
Okay. Well, this experience
has been so cool for me.

316
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,017
But I have to go home,
and put on my sweatpants,

317
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,185
and try and hold my
breath until I die.

318
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,939
No! You have to stay here and drink with me.
We're getting wasted. Here, I'm paying.

319
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:40,488
Hi. Can I get two Jacks
and Cokes, please?

320
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,459
You're really lasering into me
with your peepy missiles there.

321
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,210
What?

322
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:59,757
I said that you were lasering
into me with your peepy missiles.

323
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,302
Are my eyes my peepy missiles?

324
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,803
I'm not a doctor.

325
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,347
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

326
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,100
Both those drinks for you?

327
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,395
Are both those faces yours?

328
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,649
No, I crashed and burned
this conversation.

329
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,651
No! No, no, no. No, you're not.
Come on. No, it's okay.

330
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,279
Man, slip-ons?

331
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,489
What's wrong with slip-ons?

332
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,282
It's the winter!

333
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,992
These are an all-purpose shoe.

334
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,328
For all purposes inside
of your frat house

335
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,539
where everyone's going ping-pong,
and throwing quarters at each other's butts,

336
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,501
and throwing their house out
at the end of the year.

337
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,837
Yeah. Well, you know, that's what
they say, "Go to Williamsburg."

338
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,549
"Welcome to Brooklyn where they
judge you by your shoes." It's great.

339
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,678
This isn't Williamsburg, Virginia?

340
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,306
My God! I've been in the wrong
Williamsburg for this whole time, man.

341
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,684
Yeah. No, I haven't been
to Virginia, but this is not it.

342
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,768
I have.

343
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,894
- You have?
- Yeah.

344
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,272
I went to Virginia on a class
trip with my science teacher,

345
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,192
because I'm a city kid, so they wanted
to take us to go see, like, the country.

346
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,277
And she knew where this
horse had died in a field.

347
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,781
She wanted to dig it up so that
we could see its skeleton.

348
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,283
But when we dug it up, it hadn't
even decomposed at all,

349
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,035
'cause that takes, like,
a very long time.

350
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,205
And, you know, it had
worms on its face.

351
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,041
That teacher should be
put away. That's awful.

352
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,044
- We murdered her that day in that field.
- Stop, it's...

353
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,006
That's the only conclusion.
That's the only thing that could happen.

354
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,883
No, but... You know, she was like...
And all the children ran away.

355
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,512
But I just stayed, and I looked
at its sleeping face, you know.

356
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,390
- That's a lot of story.
- Yeah, it is.

357
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,643
- I like your shirt.
- Thank you.

358
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,396
This nice shirt's name is Max.

359
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,857
Hey. This lady's name is Donna.

360
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,401
And my shirt's name is Brenda.

361
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,695
- She's a loudmouth.
- Great.

362
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,739
Hi, Brenda. Hi, Donna.

363
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,909
Seemed like you waved more at Brenda.

364
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,497
So, Max, how did you
end up here tonight?

365
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,375
Clients. I'm here with some clients.

366
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,128
I work for a computer company.

367
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:05,425
We design a program that basically,
if you're, like, playing a multiplayer game,

368
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,261
people all over the world, it's like
you're actually playing it live.

369
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,430
So, it's like a phone call,
and it's like you're really...

370
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,598
- So it's like a phone call.
- Connected.

371
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,767
- I've made phone calls. That's cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

372
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,894
So imagine that,
but with a video game.

373
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,021
You pick up the phone,
and you're like,

374
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,399
"Hi, is computer there?" And it's like,
"I'll connect you to video game"?

375
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,778
Yep, it's somewhere in there, yeah.

376
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,946
But one of their wives
heard about this place.

377
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,741
So here we are.
Is there comedy in the back?

378
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,034
- Yeah.
- No.

379
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,120
Actually, I had just hosted a show
back there, and Donna performed.

380
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,790
- You didn't catch any?
- No, I couldn't find the room.

381
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,166
That's a bummer.

382
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,335
- 'Cause she was amazing tonight.
- You know what? Thank you.

383
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,003
Like, she's always great,

384
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,215
but, like, tonight, I would say,
she was, like, particularly on point.

385
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,467
- Interesting.
- Congrats. That's awesome.

386
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,802
You do this a lot?

387
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,595
Yeah, it's a habit.

388
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,472
Okay. All right.

389
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,018
Another round? You want
to do another round?

390
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,394
Yeah. Sure.

391
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,063
I'll try it. I'll try drinking.

392
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,231
Okay.

393
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,566
- Perfect timing.
- Okay, okay.

394
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,985
All right. On it.

395
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,367
He is hot, bro!

396
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:16,371
Yes, he is, but he's, like, so Christian.
He's like a Christmas tree.

397
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,665
So be the fucking angel on top.
Who gives a shit?

398
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,335
I'm not the angel on top. I'm the menorah
on top of the tree that burns it down.

399
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:26,672
And they're like, "Shouldn't have
had that menorah on top of me."

400
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,634
- He, like, knows Santa.
- Sit on him.

401
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,845
"Santa, can you help me
forget my memories?"

402
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:35,807
- Yes, exactly. Now you get it.
- I don't think so. That's not...

403
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39,602
I'm from a small little
town in Vermont.

404
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:44,774
My grammar school was in
a barn. How cool is that?

405
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,526
That is cool.

406
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,279
Right? Pretty sweet.

407
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,531
Is that a lie? Is that true?

408
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,909
It's a truth. It's the truth.

409
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,872
Do you think that you can tell when
somebody's wearing a wig or a toupee?

410
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,500
Do you have a wig on?

411
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,668
I knew it.

412
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,962
I have a wig over my toupee.

413
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,630
Can you tell that I'm
wearing a toupee?

414
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,633
I was only halfway right.

415
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,386
Wait till you see my merkin.

416
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,763
Oh, no.

417
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,100
Fuck, it is so cold out here!

418
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,645
I'm afraid I'm going to
get your splash-back.

419
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,230
Is this illegal?

420
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,065
Can we get arrested for this?

421
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:30,194
Are you... Who are you?
You've never peed in public before?

422
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,656
No. That's not me.

423
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,450
What about pools?

424
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,452
No, no way.

425
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,703
What, you pee in pools?

426
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,248
I've peed in every pool
I've ever been in.

427
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,337
Oh, my!

428
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,505
Did you just fucking fart in my face?

429
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,173
No.

430
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,427
Yeah. I'm...

431
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:58,097
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

432
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,475
Are you crying?

433
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,769
Don't cry, okay?

434
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,564
- Are you laughing?
- Who would cry?

435
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:11,777
- You farted in my face.
- I'm... It happened.

436
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,946
I'm sorry.

437
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,976
No fucking way.

438
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,605
I would not hire myself in this.

439
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,190
When do you start again?

440
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,486
I'm on call, which means that I only get to
work if the other receptionist gets sick.

441
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,031
- So we're praying for bird flu?
- That's right.

442
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,119
Cool, I have the dumbest
mirror face in the world.

443
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,287
Please, everybody does.

444
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,664
No, but I look like a shih tzu.

445
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,583
I look like just a little shih tzu.

446
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,751
You just want to say "shit."

447
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,962
You know, that's not not true.

448
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,173
Here, try this on.

449
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:04,927
Thank you so much for this
flammable piece of shit

450
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,055
that's gonna give me
a rash in one second.

451
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,851
And I also just activated,
like, an old whore's BO.

452
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,562
My boobs hurt really bad.

453
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,939
Maybe you're pregnant.

454
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,911
Hey, is this cute? I mean,
if it had a button, would it be...

455
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,579
What? What's wrong?

456
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,873
Oh, my God, I'm pregnant.

457
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,875
What? No! I was just kidding.

458
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,336
No, I'm late. I'm never late.

459
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,880
And my boobs are
super-swollen and sore.

460
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,465
No, it's just...
You're getting your period.

461
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,926
No, I'm never boob-sore.

462
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,427
Okay, well, maybe it's stress.

463
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,888
Didn't you say that when you
found out you were pregnant,

464
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,225
the one sign was that
you had boob soreness?

465
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:55,561
Yeah, but you and Ryan
haven't had sex in months.

466
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,313
I know.

467
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:02,276
Oh, my God! You didn't use
a condom with Pee Farter?

468
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,321
Of course, I did.

469
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,781
I don't know.

470
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,201
Hold on.

471
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,747
Yes, I remember seeing a condom.

472
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:18,167
I just don't know, like,
exactly what it did.

473
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,003
Okay, look, you're probably not,

474
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,005
but we'll go get a test.

475
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,800
I have to pack up the bookstore
in, like, 20 minutes.

476
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,511
Okay, I'll go get a test,
and I'll meet you at the bookstore.

477
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,513
- Okay?
- Yeah.

478
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:34,099
It's going to be fine.
I'm sure you're not.

479
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,643
No, you're not.

480
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,569
It's weird that you guys keep
a radio on in the bathroom.

481
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,239
Yeah, Gene has shy bowels,
and it helps him to go.

482
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,866
- Okay, I've set the timer for three minutes.
- Okay.

483
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,286
And...

484
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:56,914
One line is not pregnant,
and plus sign...

485
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,957
You are fucked.

486
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:03,170
One line, one line, one line.

487
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,298
Just going to take a big,
stinky shit while we wait.

488
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,841
Perfect. Cool timing.

489
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,261
Don't stare at that stick.

490
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,805
Okay. I'll just...

491
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,896
You're just peeing, right?

492
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,358
Great.

493
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,363
Do you want to hear the story about when
I went to get my first pregnancy test?

494
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:34,035
It was, like, 2.5 miles between where
we lived and where the pharmacy was.

495
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:38,247
I couldn't ask my mom to
drive me, so I had to...

496
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:54,805
If you've just tuned in, you're listening
to the Donna's Brain Show,

497
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,974
and I'm the voice of the brain.

498
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,727
Today, I'm sitting down
with the idiot in question

499
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:04,357
who, after being dumped and
losing her job, recently had...

500
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:09,403
Excuse me. May have had
unprotected sex with a stranger.

501
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,740
I can't get your blouse off.

502
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,824
Did I leave anything out?

503
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,701
We used a condom.

504
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,329
Okay, well, that's not what I heard.

505
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,957
Let's do this!

506
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,211
Note the razor sharp teeth.

507
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,215
We should have been using our hands.

508
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,175
No. No way.

509
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,844
Yes!

510
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,680
I don't know any wrestles.

511
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:39,099
Did you find it? It's a five
second rule. Five second rule.

512
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,896
Come on. I think that
it was more like...

513
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,523
Here you are, sir. One condom.

514
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,112
Might it be correct to say
that you cannot recall?

515
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,655
I'm getting a little dizzy.

516
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:56,575
Well, you're dizzy because you played
Russian roulette with your vagina.

517
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,495
Did you know that Hulk
Hogan's name is Terry?

518
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,081
It's time.

519
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,168
It's time.

520
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,886
Oh, God, your face.

521
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,764
Oh, my God, barf rush.

522
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,852
Do I have morning sickness?

523
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:26,272
No, that's probably
just psychosomatic.

524
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,774
Okay, there's two tests in the box.
Let's take another one.

525
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:32,194
- I'm sorry. I'm going to throw up.
- Okay.

526
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,276
- Did somebody have a bad dream?
- Oh, God, Dad!

527
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,988
That thing is freakin'
so frightening.

528
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,201
I guess I am.

529
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,495
Come on, give us a...
Come on, give us a kiss.

530
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,664
I love you. I love you.

531
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,333
Kiss yourself.

532
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,253
It's, like, 100 degrees in here.

533
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,839
Puppets work best in heat.

534
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,529
Hi, Don. Thanks for waiting.

535
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,325
It's Donna.

536
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,912
I'm so sorry.
Must have missed the "na."

537
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,580
Where are my glasses?

538
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,457
Here.

539
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,418
Thank you, Donna.

540
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:16,507
Your test came back positive,
and you are indeed pregnant.

541
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,258
Fuck!

542
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,559
Sorry for cursing.

543
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,977
That's all right. I've heard it all.

544
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,481
So, let's talk about your options.

545
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,110
I would like an abortion, please.

546
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,364
That sounds very insensitive.
I'm not sure.

547
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,366
Sounds like I was ordering
at a drive-through,

548
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:46,787
but I would like an abortion, please.

549
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,623
It's important that you've put
a lot of thought into this,

550
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,918
and that this decision
is entirely yours.

551
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,171
I'd also like to provide you with all
the information you need about abortion

552
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,507
as well as other options.

553
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,175
Yeah.

554
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,137
I have thought about it,

555
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,139
and this is what I need to do.

556
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,266
Okay.

557
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,606
So, based on the first
day of your last period,

558
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:18,444
you're about three weeks along,
which is pretty early.

559
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:23,282
In fact, it's too early to get
the procedure done with us.

560
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,575
Okay.

561
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,161
It means you need to wait.

562
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,955
I'd like to set the appointment
for two weeks from today.

563
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,083
That'll put it on the 14th.

564
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:36,128
- February 14th?
- Yeah.

565
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,006
Oh, my!

566
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,050
I guess we could do it the day after.

567
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,887
That's my mom's birthday.

568
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,976
Can't even get an abortion right.

569
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,979
I'm guessing you wouldn't
want to wait too much longer.

570
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,815
No, let's have it...

571
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,985
Let's do it on Valentine's Day.

572
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,782
Give this card to the receptionist on
your way out, and she'll schedule you.

573
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,867
Okay.

574
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,497
I should probably ask.

575
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,249
How much does this cost?

576
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,295
An in-clinic procedure
costs about $500.

577
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,380
Really?

578
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,302
Sorry.

579
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,266
That's, like, my whole rent almost.

580
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:36,981
But the cost also covers an HIV
test as well as STD testing.

581
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,732
Do you have insurance?

582
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,862
Well, if not, we can provide
financial assistance if you qualify.

583
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,324
- Do you have Medicaid?
- No.

584
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,869
Any friends or family that can help?

585
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,544
Okay, I'm out of tape now.

586
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:04,174
Hey, little lady,
is there any more tape?

587
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,926
Yeah.

588
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:09,804
Yes, there is tape in the
bathroom on the top shelf.

589
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,123
I did the first scream for screaming,

590
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,585
and then the second scream I had from
scaring myself from the first scream.

591
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,753
Yeah, I saw that.

592
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,298
- I'm gonna come in now, okay?
- Yeah.

593
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,177
What are you doing here?

594
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,845
You said you worked here, so...

595
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,721
Sure.

596
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:58,353
The Savage Detectives.
This book is amazing.

597
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,940
Well, it can be yours for 99 cents.

598
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:06,361
Hey, I just passed a Mexican
food truck on the way over here.

599
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,864
Do you wanna go get a bite?

600
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,119
When we hung out before, you said...

601
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,461
You said that you could mouth
fuck the shit out of a burrito.

602
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,671
God damn it.

603
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,257
- Yeah.
- Okay.

604
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,553
Also, do you remember
urinating in the street?

605
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,306
Among other things.

606
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,016
What?

607
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,145
- That was the main move.
- All right.

608
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,232
If you have time,
take a little break?

609
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:47,194
Well, I can't leave the
store unmanned, un-womaned.

610
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,405
Of course, sure. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,616
All right.

612
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,618
Well...

613
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,662
I'd love to take you out
sometime on a proper date.

614
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,503
Well, here's the thing,

615
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:08,882
is that the store is closing down,
and it's a hard time,

616
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,427
and it's gonna take forever, and I have
to put all the books in the boxes.

617
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,554
None of them are in the boxes.

618
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,223
I'm the only thing in a box,
and I'm not a book.

619
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,767
- Not yet.
- Yeah. Okay.

620
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,395
Totally.

621
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,688
Yeah, don't worry about it.

622
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,362
Yeah, I don't know
what I was thinking.

623
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,239
I have a copy of this already.

624
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,874
Well, good luck with the closing.

625
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,542
Thanks. You, too.

626
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:52,384
I can't believe he walked into
the store. That's a sign.

627
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,803
And that would be a sign saying...

628
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,973
Like, that I'm a present in a box,

629
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,350
and that he and I should go and
start our beautiful life together.

630
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,687
- You know, I'm not a straight guy...
- What?

631
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,481
...but my guess is that most
of them would hate that gift.

632
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,901
What? You're saying

633
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,236
that a guy doesn't want
a drunk, pregnant girl in a box?

634
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,821
If you're a serial killer.

635
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:16,574
Maybe you wanna tell him.

636
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,577
No. Why? Why?

637
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,829
You don't owe him anything.
You don't even know this guy.

638
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,207
Maybe he just deserves to know
that, like, this happened.

639
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,835
That I'm not psycho, and I'm
going to get an abortion.

640
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,504
You know, if I got someone pregnant,
I would wanna know.

641
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,924
If you got someone pregnant,
I would also want to know.

642
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,592
Probably every newspaper
would want to know,

643
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,761
'cause all of a sudden,
some dude's mouth would be pregnant.

644
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:38,430
My God, you guys, stop
it with the crazy jokes.

645
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,307
Why do you care what
he needs to know or not?

646
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,976
You are the one who has to
get this procedure, pay for it,

647
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,229
wear the fucking pad with
the big wings, okay?

648
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,731
You think if he was pregnant, he would
be worrying about you right now?

649
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,025
No, he'd be trying to get that
fucking thing out of his body.

650
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,986
God damn it! You guys, we already
live in a patriarchal society

651
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,823
where a bunch of weird old white men
in robes get to legislate our cunts.

652
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,951
You just need to be
worrying about yourself.

653
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:03,413
And why are you looking at
me like that, you little bitches?

654
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:08,626
Everything you're saying is valid,
but you are scaring my dick off.

655
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:14,048
Anyway, if your gut is to tell him,
I say do it, because he seems sweet.

656
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,259
I'm exhausted now.

657
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,891
- Does it hurt?
- Does what hurt?

658
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,103
You know, only you would know
if your vagina hurts or not.

659
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,814
Okay. Does having an abortion hurt?

660
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:34,152
No, except for some cramps afterwards,
but they feel just like period cramps.

661
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,991
Just take me through it snip-by-snip.

662
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:41,159
Okay, first of all,
there is no snips,

663
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,121
and the whole thing literally
takes, like, five minutes.

664
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,540
That's amazing. You don't even
have to clear your schedge.

665
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,334
No, you still need the whole day.
Because they talk to you for a while.

666
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:53,797
Well, you don't have to clear your
schedge, 'cause there's nothing on it.

667
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,716
How often do you think about it?

668
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,885
I think about it sometimes.
Once in a while.

669
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,723
And then I get really sad
for my little teenage self.

670
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:05,308
But I never regret it.

671
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,352
And did you ever tell your mom?

672
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,188
No, she thought I
was at field hockey.

673
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:14,025
- Were you the goalie?
- Of course I was the goalie.

674
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,951
I'm glad you're here.

675
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,119
You're so jumpy.

676
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,872
You're like an Eileen Fisher ninja.

677
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,791
I wanted to continue our
discussion about your future.

678
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,920
Okay, well, I have something that I
would like to talk to you about as well.

679
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,298
- I'd like to go first.
- Great.

680
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,924
I couldn't sleep last night.

681
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,510
So I made a spreadsheet
of all of your expenses,

682
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:45,182
job opportunities and miscellaneous
tasks that I think you should focus on.

683
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,851
Okay, well, you didn't
need to do that.

684
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,436
No shit.

685
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,898
I have a student in my office right now,
and I have one about to deliver something.

686
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,067
So, we'll do it
afterwards, all right?

687
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:03,741
And could you please go through the mail?
I'm still getting your student loan crap.

688
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,540
It's open.

689
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,752
Hello.

690
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,088
Are you fucking kidding me?

691
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,048
Fuck!

692
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,093
I'm sorry. I just...

693
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,763
I'm not stalking you. This isn't a...

694
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,933
Oh, my God.

695
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,519
Professor Stern. I'm just...
I'm looking for Professor Stern.

696
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,146
Yeah. She's my mom.

697
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,440
- She's your mom?
- Yeah.

698
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,443
She's a genius.

699
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,447
Okay, seriously though, she's, like,
the best professor I had in business school.

700
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,409
I see you about to roll your eyes again,
all right? But that's that truth.

701
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,369
She lit a fire in my belly.

702
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,829
Okay. Well, that's called diarrhea.

703
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,458
I'm sorry, but you just handed
that one to me like a little present.

704
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,502
Yeah, you know,
we've hung out before.

705
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:03,093
Anyway, your mother lent me this
book a couple of months ago,

706
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:06,012
and I'm just trying to
get it back to her, so...

707
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,847
Thank you.

708
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,224
Come on.

709
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,393
You made fun of my shoes?

710
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,979
These are my mom's.

711
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,858
Do you wanna try them on?

712
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,525
No.

713
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,029
All right, yeah, I would.

714
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,835
That's amazing.

715
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,589
I don't do hard drugs,

716
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,383
but I imagine this is what it
feels like to shoot heroin.

717
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,093
Yeah, they're so soft.

718
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,929
They're made out of,
like, angel's titty skins.

719
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:52,433
Yeah, and then she said that, so...

720
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,353
There you go.

721
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,156
So...

722
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,330
Sorry, do you wanna go get
some food or something?

723
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,544
Are you two ready to order?

724
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,214
- You know what? Actually, I haven't had...
- Yes. Yes, yes.

725
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:25,383
We'll each have the chicken
piccata over linguine, please.

726
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,344
Of course. Your favorite.

727
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,638
Thank you.

728
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,101
You are a serious regular.

729
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,564
It's, like, the one place where I can go
and wear my diaper and feel that I fit in.

730
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,482
Got it.

731
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:45,654
I also don't normally order for the
person that I'm with at a restaurant,

732
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:49,366
but the chicken piccata is the
best that this place has to offer.

733
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,868
It's the gem. It's the crown jewel.

734
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,078
You got to have it.

735
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:58,750
Well, there is nothing better
than some hot bread and butter.

736
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,501
Yeah.

737
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,130
Here you go.

738
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,135
Did you just warm
this butter up for me?

739
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,803
Yeah.

740
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,057
That's really nice.

741
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,228
That's just what you do.

742
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,484
Max, I have something
I wanna tell you.

743
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,360
What's up?

744
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,785
I have to go to the bathroom.

745
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,745
Great.

746
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,538
I kind of walked into that one, huh?

747
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:39,541
Indeed.

748
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,834
Aren't you wearing a diaper?

749
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,129
Yeah, I'm not gonna spend
it on a number one.

750
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,673
- Okay.
- Diaper is for the heavy lifting.

751
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:56,474
Hey, Max, remember from before
when we did sex to each other?

752
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:04,149
Max, I love you.
I'm having your abortion.

753
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,859
Do you wanna share a dessert?

754
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,904
Lead with that. Definitely lead
with that. Perfect. That's perfect.

755
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,283
- Hey.
- Hello.

756
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,169
Do you see this couple?

757
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,714
Yeah.

758
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,133
They're incredible.

759
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:34,346
The entire time you were gone, she has
been reading off the menu to him,

760
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:37,515
and he points at a new item,
and she just tells him what it is.

761
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,854
Maybe he just likes to hear his
favorite things read out loud.

762
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,772
That's what I thought.

763
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,275
I just love couples like this.

764
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,777
It's not a line.

765
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,530
But I can't wait to be a grandpa.

766
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,075
Man, yeah.

767
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,877
Really hitting that bread.
You're gonna have room for that piccata?

768
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,546
- Two.
- Yeah? Okay.

769
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,304
You got any shows coming up?

770
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,391
I do. I have one
tomorrow night actually.

771
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,893
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

772
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:25,730
- Where?
- Same place. Always same place.

773
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,732
Cool. Cool.

774
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,777
Can I come?

775
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,905
- Shit. Shit! Shit!
- I don't have to.

776
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,282
No, no, no. You stepped in shit.

777
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,034
- What?
- Shit!

778
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,244
Come on!

779
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:44,248
- These are my only shoes.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

780
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,335
- This is great. You're just...
- No, no. I'm just...

781
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,504
I'm glad it's... Yeah.

782
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,423
I'm just, you know,
just trying to get...

783
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,466
You stamped right down on the doodie.

784
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,593
Okay!

785
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,929
All right.

786
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,472
- You almost got it out?
- Yeah.

787
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,058
You're almost cleared?

788
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,102
Yep. Okay. All right.

789
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:07,939
Well, I'm gonna go get some bleach,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

790
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,149
- Okay.
- Good night.

791
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,320
Are you limping? I don't
wanna get it on my pants.

792
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:18,950
Yeah. My father was, like,
a funny dude, man, my father.

793
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,785
I think he's the reason
why I do comedy.

794
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:24,748
He's like a cross between
Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.

795
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:29,127
He was Cosby, like, in that he'd
hide snacks around the house.

796
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,212
And he was like Richard Pryor

797
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,297
in that he freebased cocaine.

798
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,050
Can I get a seltzer?

799
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,844
What's up?

800
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,471
You're a jumpy little kitty.

801
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,848
When do I go on?

802
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,141
It's what I wanted to
talk to you about.

803
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:46,227
We're gonna have to end early,
set up for an '80s dance party.

804
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:50,815
No. Can you just let me get five minutes?
I just wanna do five minutes.

805
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,984
You still doing that
break-up material?

806
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:57,405
I'm just doing my comedy, which is
just talking about my life, so...

807
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,325
Don't look at my shit while
I'm writing it down, man.

808
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,659
What? No, that's funny.

809
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,870
I think my bodega man judges me, too.

810
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,746
Yeah.

811
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,999
How was Los Angeles?

812
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,334
Nice deflection.

813
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:13,338
Yeah, I was in LA for three
weeks, three shitty weeks.

814
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,673
I fucking hate that place.

815
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,134
Running around, driving a
gold Kia. That's all they had.

816
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,302
Well, there was a screw-up...

817
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,387
Had to drive a gold Kia?

818
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,140
I did not pick out a gold Kia.

819
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:28,186
I would pick out a pewter
Kia, taupe, tasmine,

820
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:32,106
which is combo of taupe and jasmine.

821
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:38,195
But it now looks like I will be
moving out there for pilot season.

822
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,740
- Really?
- Yeah.

823
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,367
I sold a pilot.

824
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,953
Congrats.

825
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,204
Yeah, but let's get out of here.

826
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:50,041
Seriously. No, Donna, listen to me.

827
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,502
I'm house sitting for this
crazy rich friend of mine.

828
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,586
I mean crazy rich.

829
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,129
It's awesome. It's huge.

830
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,717
All modern like the stuff when you read
in the back of the rich people's magazines

831
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,636
that they have at the airport.

832
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,305
- Man, I don't know.
- Donna, you haven't hung out in forever.

833
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,807
Let's go. It'll be mad nice.

834
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,059
We'll get a crew together.
It'll be like the old times.

835
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,728
What rap group from 1997 are you in?

836
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,897
Whodini.

837
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,775
No, it was two different
kinds of mustard.

838
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:20,071
Man, it's colder than a witch's
titty out here. There we go.

839
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,616
- No, did I miss it?
- Yeah.

840
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,118
I'm so sorry.

841
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,662
Work was hectic. I was trying
to leave three hours ago.

842
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,497
That's okay.

843
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,915
I'm actually leaving now, though.

844
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,502
I'm gonna go hang out
with some comedians.

845
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,715
- You coming or what?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just one sec.

846
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,676
I mean, you can come, but I
just think it might be boring

847
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:45,096
or actually very depressing probably.

848
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,016
Is it just the two of you?

849
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:49,767
It's not like that.

850
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,270
That's what it looks like.

851
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:59,360
Well, thank you for coming to
Brooklyn, but you didn't have to.

852
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:00,778
You invited me.

853
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,032
Well, I didn't think that we
made, like, concrete plans.

854
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,784
Yo, this driver is
getting disgruntled.

855
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,996
Okay, one sec. I need
to go, but I am sorry.

856
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,705
Me, too.

857
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,291
Have fun.

858
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:22,884
My therapist, this is for real,

859
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:28,306
refers to standup
as plays. I'm serious.

860
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:32,185
Like, "You did a play last night.
How was your play?

861
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,478
"How was your play? Was it good?"

862
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:36,814
- Is your therapist your nana?
- No, she's your nana actually.

863
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,400
- Nana!
- That's why I go to her.

864
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,860
Yeah.

865
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,237
- Dominican woman, right?
- Right.

866
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,824
Yeah, pear-shaped, huge Marley fan.

867
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:51,162
Yeah. No, you've definitely,
yeah, nailed down my lineage.

868
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,831
All right, well...

869
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,006
Hey, how come we've
never done this before?

870
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:09,430
Because a few years ago, I rejected you,
and you've been the worst to me ever since.

871
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,852
So cheers.

872
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:17,188
Right.

873
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,274
Shit. Fuck!

874
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,404
I have a stain stick. I really do.

875
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:28,491
That's all chemicals.
This is wine. I got to soak it.

876
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:43,881
What?

877
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,758
It was either this or
the baggy sweatshirt.

878
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,761
Then why didn't you choose
the baggy sweatshirt?

879
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,388
'Cause I wanted to look nice for you.

880
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,681
Oh, my God.

881
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,809
It's gonna be very hard to
have a conversation with you

882
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,562
while you're wearing
that ladies' camisole.

883
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,481
Well, then I'll do all the talking.

884
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,525
What were we talking about?

885
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,236
I don't know.
You just erased my mind.

886
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:07,488
Break-ups.

887
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,449
Yeah.

888
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,160
I just recently went
through a pretty bad one.

889
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,080
- She cheated on you?
- Worse.

890
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:20,376
What's worse than getting
cheated on? Think about it.

891
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,005
I mean, I don't
understand how a person

892
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:27,091
who can claim that they love you,
act like they love you,

893
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,260
say it in words, say it in action,

894
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:35,391
can then turn around in that
same breath and tell you

895
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,394
that they don't do anal.

896
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,855
For Christ's sake. Jesus Christ.

897
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,107
What? I was kidding.

898
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,193
Are you leaving?

899
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:47,487
Yeah, I'm gonna do that now.

900
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,113
I was kidding.

901
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,282
Of course she did anal.

902
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,450
You're an idiot.

903
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,827
No, she was Greek Catholic.
You know how they are.

904
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,372
I don't care about the anal
or your stupid loft or any...

905
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,334
I can't even believe I've made it
this deep into this experience.

906
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,670
You know what I think, is that
you should stay the night here,

907
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:10,009
and we can keep talking
and work some stuff out.

908
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:14,806
Donna, come on.
You didn't even see the shower.

909
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:19,268
Donna! All right, I'm gonna
jerk off. You're missing it.

910
00:57:39,832 --> 00:57:42,958
Hi, it's Donna.

911
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:46,754
I'm really sorry about tonight.
I'm really, really sorry.

912
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:50,799
I never should have just...

913
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:55,471
I saw you, and I got very nervous.
I got taken by surprise.

914
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,348
I have something that I
wanna talk to you about,

915
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,767
and I've been meaning to talk to you.

916
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,436
And I don't wanna leave
it on your voicemail.

917
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,857
So, will you call me back, please?

918
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:08,150
Thank you. Bye-bye.

919
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,495
Sir, can you turn around and
go to Manhattan, please?

920
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,789
You said Brooklyn.

921
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,957
I changed my mind.

922
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,752
Hi.

923
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,047
Are you sick?

924
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,759
What time is it?

925
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,802
I think probably midnight.

926
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,430
What's wrong? What going on?

927
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,224
Mom, can I come in bed with you?

928
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,101
Yeah.

929
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,272
What's the matter, sweetie?

930
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,275
Talk to me.

931
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,867
I'm pregnant, and I'm
having an abortion.

932
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,622
Thank God.

933
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,707
I thought you were gonna tell
me you were moving to LA.

934
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,626
What? No.

935
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:54,799
God. I was so scared to tell you.

936
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,803
Sweetheart, I know that we
haven't been getting along lately,

937
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:02,389
but you should never be
afraid to talk to me.

938
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,726
I was...

939
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:15,736
I was scared that you'd be very
angry and very disappointed.

940
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,071
Well, I'm neither.

941
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:23,244
Look, I can't believe I
never told you this,

942
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:26,789
but when I was in college,
I had an abortion.

943
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,459
- Dad's?
- No. God. Not your father's.

944
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,046
No, it was my college
boyfriend's, Robert.

945
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:37,675
And abortions were
illegal in those days,

946
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:42,430
so your grandma had to drive
me in the family station wagon

947
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,515
all the way to New Jersey.

948
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:48,436
And we had to go to some
stranger's apartment.

949
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:51,022
When I got up there,
there was 12 other women

950
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:54,399
just sitting there in
some kind of stupor.

951
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,237
And they put me up on
the kitchen table,

952
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:01,198
they gave me some kind
of shot to put me out,

953
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,991
and that was that.

954
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:07,621
Next night, I was dancing at
your aunt's sweet 16 party.

955
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,459
I didn't know that.

956
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,508
You know, I was going
through some old papers,

957
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,970
and I found this book the other day

958
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:26,724
that you had written when
you were 11 years old.

959
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:30,269
- I wrote a book?
- Yes, you don't remember?

960
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,396
You wrote it to me.

961
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:36,191
You sent me a chapter
every week from camp.

962
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:41,405
It was about this little
girl detective named Winks.

963
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:45,409
She had a twitch.

964
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:49,163
I have a book for you actually

965
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:52,625
that one of your
students dropped it off,

966
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:56,128
and somehow it slipped my mind.
I forgot to give it to you.

967
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,422
Max Brown.

968
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,425
Is he, like, a teacher's pet?

969
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,595
Did he compliment you
on your alpaca sweater?

970
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:10,225
Actually, he's a very good student
and a pretty good writer, too.

971
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:13,896
Interesting. Why are
you asking about Max?

972
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,273
There's no reason.

973
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,776
Because he's not your type.

974
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,613
Okay, what is my type?

975
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,616
- Smelly.
- Mom!

976
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:28,744
Ryan didn't wear deodorants
with antiperspirant in them,

977
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,246
because he was afraid of Alzheimer's.

978
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,707
Right. I would rather not
remember smelling like garbage

979
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:38,086
than remember that I'd been
stinking my entire life.

980
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:43,092
Yeah, okay, that was, like,
a very funny observation.

981
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:46,511
- Thank you.
- You made a full joke.

982
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:21,255
Darn it. I thought I would
fool you with my 212 number.

983
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:26,093
Hello, it's me again,
calling you again.

984
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:35,102
I can't remember the last time I left a
number in my own speaking voice, so...

985
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,688
Anyway, here it is.

986
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,525
I am gonna be at the store until 5:00

987
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:46,613
and then maybe attempting to
make people laugh around 8:30.

988
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,909
You should stop by
if you feel like it.

989
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:55,372
I promise I won't leave with a
stranger unless that stranger is you.

990
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:57,457
Goodbye.

991
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,804
They say to be yourself on dates,

992
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,891
but I actually think that's
horrible advice from my experience.

993
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:18,687
No one wants to talk about how
Jeffrey Dahmer was actually hot.

994
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:24,109
Or how it's offensive
that I'm not his type.

995
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:32,076
You are gonna kill it out there.

996
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:36,413
I actually have an appointment
to do that tomorrow. I'm sorry.

997
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:39,708
Boy. Okay.

998
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,337
- What do you want to drink?
- Seltzer, please.

999
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,422
One seltzer.

1000
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,555
I really wanna bring the
next comic to the stage now,

1001
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:56,225
because I think everything
about her is fucking cool.

1002
01:04:56,226 --> 01:05:00,563
And I think that you guys are definitely
going to agree with me on this.

1003
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:04,483
She is hot as shit and brilliant.

1004
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:07,986
Everyone, please welcome Donna Stern.

1005
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:18,372
You guys like my singing voice?

1006
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:23,210
I just burped into this
because I'm an adult woman.

1007
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,131
I do like being an adult woman.

1008
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:29,633
I've always wanted to be that...

1009
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:34,972
I've always wanted to have just,
like, a bra, and a blouse,

1010
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,474
and a schedule.

1011
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,977
Like, where I could just, like,
be in my house and just be like,

1012
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:43,522
"Oh, my God, I'm running late,"
you know? Like...

1013
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:46,734
I've always wanted to be able to
be on the car phone and be like,

1014
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:50,320
"Okay, Susan, will do.

1015
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:54,992
"What? Okay. All right. Talk soon."

1016
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:59,163
And then just hang up and
not worry about, you know,

1017
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:03,041
why the bathroom
smells in a weird way.

1018
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,672
But I'm not here to
talk about car phones.

1019
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:12,635
I came here tonight on a
very different mission.

1020
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,803
And that is

1021
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:19,808
to say to you that...

1022
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,021
Sorry.

1023
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:27,983
Which is to say to you

1024
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,944
that I am pregnant.

1025
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:39,077
Okay, all right, testing the waters.
I dropped that one down.

1026
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:45,042
The second thing that I would
like to say right now, out loud,

1027
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,252
and I'm gonna say it
out loud right now.

1028
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,546
Out loud, right now...
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

1029
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:52,424
Just rolling along with this,
out loud, right now.

1030
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:56,929
Is that I am going to
have an abortion...

1031
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,431
Okay, okay, keep breathing.

1032
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:02,393
...tomorrow,
which is Valentine's Day.

1033
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:05,395
So, we'll start from there.

1034
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,940
I'm sure you're wondering
how this happened.

1035
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:16,573
A little thing I like to call getting
banged out in the middle of the night,

1036
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:22,787
the heat, heat, heat of the night,
by a very nice person

1037
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:25,833
that I don't know very well at all.

1038
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:29,420
I don't know. He was a
stranger, but a nice one.

1039
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:33,548
Probably the best of all the
strangers that are out there.

1040
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,759
And of course you guys
aren't strangers anymore

1041
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,472
because now you're a part
of my life in a big way.

1042
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,435
So I don't know if you've gleaned
that maybe I'm not ready to be a mom.

1043
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:47,730
You're like, "No shit.
You are not ready to be a mom."

1044
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:52,234
And so I decided to get the abortion,

1045
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,403
but I really do love pregnant ladies,

1046
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:59,366
and there's lots of things about
being a mom that seem fun,

1047
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:03,787
but for me it's just like I can't
tell anyone to shut off the TV.

1048
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,623
Equaling I can't shut off the TV.

1049
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:14,047
I decided to tell my mom,
and I thought she was gonna like,

1050
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,008
you know, be super upset,

1051
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,634
and, like, set me
on fire and be like,

1052
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,470
"You can never come
back to the synagogue."

1053
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:23,307
Which is also kind of a fantasy that I'd
never have to go back to the synagogue.

1054
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:26,393
So boring. Everyone's
breath is horrible there.

1055
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,479
But instead,

1056
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:33,150
she was very relieved,

1057
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,944
and she actually ended up telling me

1058
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:40,657
that she herself had gotten
an abortion in the '60s.

1059
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,160
Which is pretty amazing

1060
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:47,038
because the bushes were so big then,

1061
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:55,714
that, you know, they must have really,
you know, really had to hunt for it.

1062
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:03,514
And I can say that because, you know,
once you get an abortion,

1063
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:06,892
you can reveal who else has had them.

1064
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:12,314
I decided to be on the list of the
very many women that have done this.

1065
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:18,194
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day,
and I can honestly say

1066
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:24,784
it's not going to be the worst
Valentine's Day I've ever had.

1067
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,081
It's gonna be okay because

1068
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,293
I know that I'm not alone.

1069
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:36,755
I'm totally here. You guys are here.

1070
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,132
You're all gonna come
with me tomorrow.

1071
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,553
But it's going to be...

1072
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,897
I think it's going to be okay.

1073
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:57,568
And afterwards,
I'll just be in my future.

1074
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:00,696
And, you know,
we'll go from there, right?

1075
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:02,614
I guess so.

1076
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,575
That's really it.

1077
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,910
You guys have been very
generous to me tonight,

1078
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,745
and I've really enjoyed myself.

1079
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,790
So, thank you and happy V-Day.

1080
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:15,460
Hope you get all the candy
that you want and deserve.

1081
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,796
That's it. Thank you.

1082
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:19,274
- Morning, sunshine.
- Hey.

1083
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,235
You were so incredible last night.

1084
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,696
He left.

1085
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:27,449
I was talking about your set.

1086
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,784
Thanks.

1087
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,619
How's your stomach? You want this?

1088
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,496
No, I don't. I just want this.

1089
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:37,709
Well, when you're ready,
I'll call us a cab.

1090
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,962
Are you ready?

1091
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,921
I'm ready.

1092
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:46,343
Okay, thank you very much.
We are outside.

1093
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:47,678
Five minutes.

1094
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:48,804
Let's just take the train.

1095
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:51,389
No, we're aborting in style.

1096
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,642
I'm so cold!

1097
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:54,726
Freezing.

1098
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,354
Have you ever heard about
the people on Mount Everest

1099
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:59,356
who are about to die,
and how that is for them?

1100
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,358
No, tell me what happens to them.

1101
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:02,693
It's not like what you imagine.

1102
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:04,987
Like, that there are icicles coming
out of their tears or whatever.

1103
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,239
The Sherpa is like, "Don't sit down."

1104
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,617
But then they sit down, because they're
so tired that they'll just die up there.

1105
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:12,411
- Oh, my God.
- And all their parkas are still there.

1106
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:15,122
Max. Max. Max is walking.

1107
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:18,709
Max is walking up. I'm not kidding,
and he has a bouquet of flowers.

1108
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,335
No, he's coming. He's coming. Yeah.

1109
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,295
- I can't... What do I do?
- You just... I don't know.

1110
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,339
- Pretend I'm saying something.
- You are saying something.

1111
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,549
- God...
- He's coming.

1112
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,925
- He's getting very close.
- What's my face look like?

1113
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,010
It's happening now. He's here.

1114
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,639
- Hey.
- Hi.

1115
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,892
These are for you.

1116
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,810
That's so nice.

1117
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:45,235
I thought, maybe, if it
was all right with you

1118
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,030
and you,

1119
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:53,117
I could go with you.

1120
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:09,092
You can look at my sheet. It's okay.
I don't have any secrets.

1121
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,303
Nice.

1122
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,390
Mental illness runs in your family.

1123
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:19,435
Yeah, we have diabetes
and depression.

1124
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,438
The diabetes?

1125
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,440
You guys like to eat a lot
of candy in your family?

1126
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:26,401
Lot of desserts, lot of pie,
lot of brownie sundaes.

1127
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,778
- That's darling.
- Yeah.

1128
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:36,035
So cold out today.

1129
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:42,208
When I looked on weather.com
this morning to pick out my outfit,

1130
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,879
I saw that it is the
coldest day of the year.

1131
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,630
Really?

1132
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:52,928
I heard they're going to start naming
snowstorms like they do with hurricanes.

1133
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:56,055
That's how intense it's
going to be from now on.

1134
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:59,892
The Donna.

1135
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,979
Snowstorm of the century.

1136
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,606
Donna Two.

1137
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,817
Have you ever watched a
weather report before?

1138
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:08,235
Man, I got to get on that.

1139
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:10,987
- Just movie trailers for you, huh?
- Is that what that is?

1140
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,905
Is that all?

1141
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:22,206
I'm sorry I took off last night.

1142
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,168
I got your voicemails.

1143
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:29,339
I just didn't know what to do.

1144
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:35,970
I also made a very
extreme move last night.

1145
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,306
Yeah, but

1146
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,768
it was an asshole move on my part.

1147
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,353
No.

1148
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:47,857
I think we're both just
trying to figure out

1149
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:52,904
- how to do everything.
- Yeah.

1150
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:56,908
I really wanted to tell you when
we were at dinner, but then you...

1151
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:01,705
I freaked out because you started talking
about wanting to be a grandfather.

1152
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:04,291
And you thought I meant,
like, tomorrow?

1153
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,251
Well, you're, like, 76, right?

1154
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,211
Yeah. Yep.

1155
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,505
I just don't... You know.

1156
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,175
We've just been acquainted.

1157
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:16,553
I didn't know if you'd
be okay with this.

1158
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,055
Are you okay with this?

1159
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,725
Yeah. Yes.

1160
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,269
- Of course.
- Good.

1161
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,565
I want to be a grandpa,
you know, someday.

1162
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:34,404
- Dad first and then... Right.
- Yeah.

1163
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:50,378
This may be the best/worst
Valentine's Day I have ever had.

1164
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,590
Which one of you is Donna?

1165
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,511
Follow me, please.

1166
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,765
Okay.

1167
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:13,192
Well, thank you for coming.

1168
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:16,362
Thanks for letting me.

1169
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,991
See you on the other side?

1170
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,570
Hi, Donna. The sedative
should be taking effect.

1171
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:00,031
Are you feeling relaxed?

1172
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:16,131
Okay, Donna, we're going
to start the procedure now.

1173
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:20,051
Let us know if you feel any
discomfort at any time.

1174
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,774
- Here you go. It's hot. Careful.
- Thank you.

1175
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:26,910
Do you want to put your feet up?

1176
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,578
Okay.

1177
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,085
- How's that?
- It's good.

1178
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:40,715
I made a bunch of friends
in the waiting room

1179
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,633
at the DMV.

1180
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,303
Oh, God.

1181
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,472
We weren't at the DMV.

1182
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,099
I got my license renewed.

1183
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,892
You did?

1184
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,436
Were you not...
I got the car inspected.

1185
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:56,814
You know, I think they towed my car.

1186
01:18:56,941 --> 01:19:00,360
Yeah, they sort of took a lot
of stuff out of the trunk.

1187
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,695
And, you know, for a second,
I was afraid to drive it again,

1188
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,114
but I think I probably will.

1189
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:07,450
- So you were there? You were at the DMV.
- Yeah.

1190
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,285
That was us.

1191
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,123
- Do you want to watch a movie?
- Always.

1192
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:14,749
Okay.

1193
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:18,711
Let's see what we got going on here.

1194
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,968
It is nothing but romantic comedies.

1195
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,512
I just hate that type of film.

1196
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,349
I don't connect to it.

1197
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,225
Here we go.

1198
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,145
We have hit the mother lode.

1199
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:38,648
Gone with the Wind is about to start.
Have you ever seen this?

1200
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:40,275
I have not.

1201
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,818
I've never seen it either.

1202
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:45,655
Do you want to watch it?

1203
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:49,075
I mean, I do, but it's,
like, 10 hours long.

1204
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:52,578
Do you have somewhere to be?
