1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,460
THEY LIVE

2
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,925
JOB OPPORTUNITIES

3
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,176
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.

4
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:46,801
I worked there for ten years
but then things just dried up.

5
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:52,133
They lost 14 banks in one week.

6
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,962
There's nothing available for you,
right now.

7
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:16,928
They use their tongues to
deceive you. Venom is on their lips.

8
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:23,383
Their mouths are full
of bitterness and curses.

9
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,918
The fear of God
is not before their eyes.

10
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:36,215
They have taken
the hearts and minds of our leaders.

11
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,546
They have blinded us to the truth.

12
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,837
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?

13
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:52,004
Outside the limit of our sight
they're feeding off us.

14
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:59,046
Perched on top of us
from birth to death, are our owners.

15
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,131
They have us. They control us.
They are our masters.

16
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,258
Wake up.
They're all around you.

17
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:40,466
Sometimes when I watch TV
I stop being myself. I'm a star.

18
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:46,549
I have my own talk show. Or I'm
on the news getting out of a limo.

19
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,927
All I ever have to do is be famous.
People watch me.

20
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,629
And they love me.

21
00:05:55,833 --> 00:06:01,465
I never grow old, and I never die.

22
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,504
Excuse me,
do you need anybody?

23
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:29,042
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.

24
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:34,008
This is a union job.

25
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,760
May I please speak
with the shop steward, sir?

26
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,211
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.

27
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,593
Excuse me, when do I get paid?

28
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,341
Thursday.

29
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,587
Do you need a place to stay?

30
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:57,505
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.

31
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,085
I don't like being followed
unless I know why.

32
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:36,095
I don't turn up with anybody
until I see where he's going.

33
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,167
They'll be serving food up soon.

34
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:20,296
This is Gilbert. Anything you need,
he knows where to find it.

35
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,757
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.

36
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,761
If you can use them,
you can fix the shower over there.

37
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,292
Let's get something to eat.

38
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,963
- More?
- Yeah.

39
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,426
I've got a wife and two kids
back in Detroit.

40
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,880
I haven't seen them in six months.

41
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:20,170
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.

42
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:29,176
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.

43
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:36,135
The golden rule: He who has the gold
makes the rules.

44
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:45,470
If they close one more factory, we
should take a sledge to their foreign cars.

45
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:50,753
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.

46
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,505
The whole deal
is some kind of crazy game.

47
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:01,464
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.

48
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:08,300
Only everyone is out for themselves
and looking to do you in.

49
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,213
You do what you can, but I'm going
to do my best to blow your ass away.

50
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:27,505
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.

51
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:32,088
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.

52
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:38,094
Everybody has got
their own hard times, these days.

53
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:06,545
You thought press-on nails would
impede all the active things you do.

54
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,211
We've got beautiful, natural-looking,
easy-to-apply nails.

55
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:16,502
There's seven different colors ...

56
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,927
Our impulses are being redirected.

57
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:26,632
We live in an artificially-induced
state of consciousness.

58
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:31,919
Goddamn hacker. That's the second
time tonight that asshole has cut in.

59
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:36,881
The movement began eight months ago
by a group of scientists.

60
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:42,260
They accidentally discovered
these signals being sent ...

61
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,584
That thing's giving me a headache.

62
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:52,592
It must have taken him months
to figure out how to do this.

63
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:59,334
The under-class is growing.
Human rights are non-existent.

64
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:07,427
In their repressive society, we
are their unwitting accomplices.

65
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,294
Their intention to rule rests with
the annihilation of consciousness.

66
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:21,463
We have been lulled into a trance.
They have made us indifferent.

67
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:27,219
We are focused
only on our own gain ...

68
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:39,836
They are safe
as long as they are not discovered.

69
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:45,628
That is their method of survival.
Keep us asleep. Keep us selfish.

70
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:51,465
- Keep us sedated.
- Blow it out of your ass.

71
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:23,380
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.

72
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,837
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.

73
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:46,500
The sleeping middle-class
is suddenly becoming poor.

74
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:52,875
We are their cattle.
We are being bred for slavery.

75
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:59,378
- Not again.
- We cannot break their signal.

76
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:05,135
The signal must be shut off
at the source.

77
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,382
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.

78
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:17,882
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.

79
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,962
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP

80
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:12,261
There's nothing wrong with it.

81
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,334
Only a few seconds got on the air.

82
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:23,378
Forget about breaking their signal.
They just jam us out again.

83
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:30,216
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work. We've discussed this.

84
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,421
We have no other choice.

85
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:47,963
Robbing banks. Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.

86
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,757
We've got to find strong people
who'll work with us.

87
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:34,715
I'm just leaving. Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.

88
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:40,469
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.

89
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:43,921
Now your hands.

90
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:48,801
You're a working man.
The revolution

91
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,586
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.

92
00:19:55,583 --> 00:20:00,885
This world may have blinded me,
but the Lord let me see.

93
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,383
You'll be back.

94
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:26,636
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.

95
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,337
An epidemic of violence
is what they're saying.

96
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:34,251
I was talking
to one old boy from San Anselmo.

97
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:40,795
He says up there they're talking
end-of-the-world kind of stuff.

98
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,380
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.

99
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:07,626
A whole lot of people going crazy
over some nutty dream they just had.

100
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:15,635
The truth is, this kind of shit
happens at the end of every century.

101
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:20,088
It's just people
afraid to face the future.

102
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,753
What's happening?

103
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:38,341
I was inside there. It's full of boxes
and some kind of lab setup.

104
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:42,843
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.

105
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:50,211
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.

106
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:54,092
Gilbert is in there helping them.

107
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:04,507
I've got a job now.
I just keep walking the white line.

108
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:10,340
I don't bother nobody. Nobody bothers
me. You should do the same.

109
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:23,629
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.

110
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:31,756
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

111
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,381
Step down. Easy. This way.

112
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:32,134
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.

113
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:14,044
Go, go!

114
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,261
Fran k!

115
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:51,178
Leave us alone.
We know you.

116
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:10,754
"Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no evil."

117
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:44,798
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

118
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,459
Did somebody start WW Ill?

119
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:37,925
Oman's collection
puts passion before fashion.

120
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:42,505
Out goes glitter
and in comes divine excess.

121
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:50,877
The warm collection revels
in freedom of expression.

122
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,629
OBEY

123
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,799
OBEY

124

MARRY AND REPRODUCE

125

NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT

00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:50,042
CONSUME

00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,295

128
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,629
OBEY

129
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,711
DO NOT QUESTION AUTHORITY

130
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,004
What's your problem?

131
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,011
What's your problem?

132
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,459
How are you today, sir?

133
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:17,461
Thank you, sir.

134
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,178
Here you are, sir. Thank you.

135
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:46,759
Are you going to pay for that?

136
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,505
THIS IS YOUR GOD

137
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:58,803
I don't want no hassle.
Pay for it or put it back.

138
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:08,919
Sleep.

139
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,423
Sleep.

140
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,131
Sleep.

141
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:44,417
She didn't even go to Lamas class.

142
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:49,802
I told her,
for yourself and the baby, go.

143
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:32,134
- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas! So dated!

144
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,585
- I'm so depressed. What do I do?
- Go for it, man.

145
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:50,377
That's easy for you to say,
you got the promotion.

146
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:58,171
The feeling is definitely there-
It's a new morning in America.

147
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:02,801
The old cynicism is gone.
We have faith in our leaders.

148
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,584
We're optimistic
as to what becomes of it all.

149
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:13,084
It really boils down
to our ability to accept.

150
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:19,004
- There are no limits-
- I figured on something like this.

151
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,502
Excuse me.

152
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:29,669
You look like your head
fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.

153
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:39,465
You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.

154
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:44,423
I take these glasses off,
she looks like a regular person.

155
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:50,382
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.

156
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:55,009
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.

157
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:00,342
I've got one that can see.

158
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:14,336
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.

159
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:18,672
I don't like this one bit.

160
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,424
Not one bit.

161
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:47,380
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.

162
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:57,340
Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?

163
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:01,467
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.

164
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:07,672
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?

165
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:12,130
You look as shitty to us
as we do to you.

166
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:17,715
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.

167
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:26,710
You stumbled onto something here,
but maybe we can all benefit from it.

168
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:33,002
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk this over.

169
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:57,547
You bastards die just like we do.

170
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:50,798
I have come here to chew bubblegum
and kick ass.

171
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:57,379
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

172
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:18,463
Near the entrance. Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s. Long hair.

173
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:23,753
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.

174
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:53,337
And who are you?

175
00:42:55,125 --> 00:43:00,211
Come to show them where I am.

176
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:11,841
Drop it.

177
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:15,667
Drop it.

178
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:24,761
Beat it.

179
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:06,632
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.

180
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,337
Close the door.

181
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,006
Drive.

182
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,712
Not too fast.

183
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:56,875
They're gone.

184
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:05,672
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?

185
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:09,254
- Are you married?
- Yes.

186
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:16,461
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.

187
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:21,052
Live alone?

188
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:26,505
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.

189
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:31,134
I'm afraid I must insist.

190
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,211
Hi, Holly!

191
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:45,341
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.

192
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,881
It's like a drug. Wearing
these glasses makes you high

193
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:54,632
but you come down hard.

194
00:46:54,833 --> 00:47:00,966
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.

195
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:07,669
I'm sorry,
but I needed you to get away.

196
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:15,965
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.

197
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:25,669
We're in trouble. They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.

198
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:31,177
We're being controlled by these things
and we've got to stop them.

199
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:38,918
I'll do whatever you want,
just don't hurt me, please.

200
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:43,084
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

201
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:51,715
You're fighting the forces of evil
that can only be seen with sunglasses.

202
00:47:54,583 --> 00:48:00,340
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.

203
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:05,844
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.

204
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:18,586
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way It's your way.

205
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:05,084
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.

206
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:12,136
Go ahead.

207
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:38,636
I'm sorry I have to be here.

208
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:57,420
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.

209
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,756
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?

210
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,676
Assistant program director. Cable 54.

211
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:18,417
A TV station? They're sending
signals out of TV sets.

212
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:37,293
No, I'm all right.

213
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:51,419
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.

214
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,425
Yes, I'll hold.

215
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:17,011
Fran k?

216
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:23,677
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.

217
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:27,675
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?

218
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:31,459
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.

219
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,420
You ain't showing me nothing.

220
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:38,835
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.

221
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,753
Get out of here.

222
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:07,344
Oh, no!

223
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:47,668
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.

224
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:54,920
Wait!

225
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:58,504
You'd better find someplace to hide.

226
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:02,008
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!

227
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:06,714
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.

228
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:16,801
I'm trying to save you
and your family's life.

229
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,426
You can't even save yourself.

230
00:56:23,042 --> 00:56:30,335
I'm giving you a choice. Put these on
or start eating that trash can.

231
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:35,126
- Not this year.
- Okay.

232
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:42,292
Come on.

233
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:05,884
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.

234
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,844
Put on the glasses.

235
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,130
I told you
I didn't want to be involved.

236
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:46,211
Dirty motherfucker.

237
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:05,008
Take a look. Put them on.

238
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:12,676
No!

239
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:53,386
I'm sorry.

240
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:13,876
Put the glasses on. Put them on!

241
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:39,504
Fuck you!

242
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,256
Look! They're everywhere.

243
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:41,758
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.

244
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:48,878
Hold on. You aren't the first one
to wake up out of a dream.

245
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:51,552
What's that?

246
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:06,334
Brother, life's a bitch
and she's back in heat.

247
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,549
I want a room.

248
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:39,209
Ain't love grand?

249
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,674
CONFORM

250
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:06,087
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.

251
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:16,050
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?

252
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:20,926
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.

253
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:25,676
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?

254
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:31,548
- Wait.
- Wait for what?

255
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:37,587
When you get your master plan,
you let me know.

256
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:50,303
If we can see, we've got to find
the people who made these.

257
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:56,177
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.

258
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:17,464
A long time ago,
things were different.

259
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:26,092
Daddy took me down to the river and
told me about the power and the glory.

260
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:29,045
I was saved.

261
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:36,884
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.

262
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:43,047
I ran away when I was 13.

263
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:50,504
He tried to cut me once
with a big old razor.

264
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:57,876
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please."

265
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:05,672
He kept moving back and forth,
like he was sawing down a tree.

266
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:15,844
Maybe they've always been with us,
those things out there.

267
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:21,594
Maybe they love it,
seeing us hate each other.

268
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:27,219
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.

269
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:33,796
I've got news for him.

270
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,880
There's going to be hell to pay.

271
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:43,294
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.

272
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,802
Fran k?

273
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:29,046
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.

274
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:34,667
The world needs a wake-up call.

275
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:40,338
We're going to phone it in.

276
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,719
Hey brothers

277
01:08:01,417 --> 01:08:04,967
There's something new going down.

278
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:38,759
They're using candyfloss packaging
to cover up a toxic waste dump.

279
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:56,756
Frank, glad you made it. Take your
glasses off. We're all human in here.

280
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:10,922
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.

281
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:15,880
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.

282
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:20,420
Go ahead.

283
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:44,592
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.

284
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:49,047
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.

285
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:56,634
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.

286
01:09:56,833 --> 01:10:00,758
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.

287
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:07,796
Promotions, bank accounts,
new houses, cars.

288
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,427
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.

289
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:22,797
Fluorocarbons have increased since
1958. Earth is being acclimatised.

290
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,380
They are turning our atmosphere
into their atmosphere.

291
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:32,544
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.

292
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:38,962
The earth is just another developing
planet. Their third world.

293
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:43,217
...deplete the planet,
move on to another.

294
01:10:43,417 --> 01:10:50,676
They want benign indifference.
We could be pets or food.

295
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:54,209
But all we really are is livestock.

296
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:02,465
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.

297
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:08,094
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?

298
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:11,136
Once.

299
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:15,509
- What's that?
- One of their watches.

300
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:20,919
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.

301
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:31,007
They've got secret code.
They push a button

302
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:37,295
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.

303
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:43,792
Listen up. We're obviously
not getting to enough people.

304
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:50,053
There should be twice as many people
here. We're getting too sloppy.

305
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:56,417
Their detection
is becoming more effective.

306
01:11:56,625 --> 01:12:02,962
Stay aware. Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.

307
01:12:03,167 --> 01:12:06,797
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.

308
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,509
Stop talking about it. It's time
we started spilling some blood.

309
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:21,546
Wait a minute! We don't stand a chance
with a few guns and grenades.

310
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:25,709
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.

311
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:30,798
We locate their signal
and shut it off.

312
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:38,134
Dave works at KRDA.
He may have located the signal.

313
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:41,212
KRDA is clear.

314
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:46,173
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.

315
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:58,792
It's important to find out exactly
where this signal is coming from.

316
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,925
I've got to talk to someone.

317
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:21,966
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

318
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:27,094
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.

319
01:13:30,292 --> 01:13:35,753
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.

320
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:48,212
I just want to

321
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:50,840
Can we ...?

322
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,800
Get out!

323
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:53,344
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.

324
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:58,297
There's nothing you can do out there.

325
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,301
If I can get this working,
I can listen in.

326
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,836
- Frank...
- What?

327
01:16:14,042 --> 01:16:17,296
- Get set.
- Shit!

328
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:26,302
- What was that?
- I don't know.

329
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:37,375
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear

330
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:41,417
Move! Down there!

331
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:45,541
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.

332
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:52,841
Two seconds.
One second.

333
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:59,712
If you need assistance
in finding your destination, -

334
01:16:59,917 --> 01:17:05,003
- bilingual instructions
are posted in each corridor.

335
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:10,876
- What language is that?
- I don't know.

336
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:15,168
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.

337
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:19,380
Some kind of underground base.

338
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:25,420
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.

339
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:39,342
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.

340
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,220
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!

341
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:47,627
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.

342
01:17:57,875 --> 01:18:00,549
I'm hearing something.

343
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:23,090
By the year 2025,
America and the entire planet -

344
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:28,128
- will be under the protection
of this power alliance.

345
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:35,547
The gains have been substantial for us
and for you, the human power-elite.

346
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:52,177
You have given us the resources
we need for our expansion.

347
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:56,551
In return, the per-capita income
of each of you has grown.

348
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:01,836
This year alone,
it's an average 39%.

349
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:14,297
I've received word that our forces
have won a major victory.

350
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:20,553
The underground terrorist network
has been destroyed.

351
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:24,835
The situation is normal again.

352
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:31,878
Hi boys, I didn't know
you'd been recruited.

353
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:36,919
You should have dressed
for the party now you can afford it.

354
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:44,760
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?

355
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:50,089
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.

356
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:58,755
I knew we had a lot in common
the first time we met.

357
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:12,129
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.

358
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:19,296
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?

359
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:25,553
I know it's only for emergency,
but they're so much fun.

360
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:32,962
You think that's something,
take a look at this.

361
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:36,467
- Take a closer look.
- Attention, commuters.

362
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:41,969
Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda
is now ready.

363
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:45,717
That's where they come from.

364
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:11,886
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.

365
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:18,170
It puts a bend in the light and
you move from place to place.

366
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:23,051
The whole thing
works like one big airport.

367
01:21:24,917 --> 01:21:31,675
They've got their act together,
believe you me.

368
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,675
Evening, boys. Looking sharp.

369
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:49,550
Wait till you see
what I'm going to show you now.

370
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:02,462
Here's the brains of the operation.

371
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:07,173
The signal goes out through
the satellite all over the world.

372
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:12,256
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.

373
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:32,584
This is as far as we go.

374
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,667
Can you get us inside? I've never
seen the inside of a TV studio.

375
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:51,008
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.

376
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:55,338
Those boys over there
are friends of mine.

377
01:22:55,542 --> 01:23:01,800
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?

378
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,551
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?

379
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,219
Right here.

380
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:13,544
Watch the door.

381
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:22,753
- Soundproof. Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.

382
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:31,464
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.

383
01:23:31,667 --> 01:23:34,967
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.

384
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:40,424
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.

385
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:47,042
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.

386
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:51,300
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.

387
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:56,176
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.

388
01:23:56,375 --> 01:24:01,381
If we help them, they'll leave us
alone to make some money.

389
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:07,090
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.

390
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:11,627
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?

391
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:16,964
We all sell out every day,
might as well be on the winning team.

392
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:21,836
See you , boys.

393
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,753
Let's go.

394
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:33,755
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.

395
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:48,047
What the hell is going on?

396
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:05,631
Down!

397
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:20,172
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.

398
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:27,920
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?

399
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:32,210
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program something.

400
01:25:32,417 --> 01:25:37,969
Security alert. Sections Delta
and X-ray report to the fourth floor.

401
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:40,636
Who's Holly?

402
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,753
Shit!

403
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:53,549
I hate to interrupt. Could you
tell me how to get to the roof?

404
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:59,678
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.

405
01:26:13,542 --> 01:26:18,628
There's got to be more than one way
to get up there.

406
01:26:20,667 --> 01:26:25,173
Security 950. They're on the move.

407
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:11,965
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st. We've got them.

408
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,880
Holly!

409
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,836
Come on!

410
01:27:57,208 --> 01:28:02,214
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.

411
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:39,255
Frank! Are you and Holly clear?

412
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:44,134
I'm clear, are you?

413
01:28:46,792 --> 01:28:49,466
Don't do it.

414
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,970
Don't interfere. You can't win.

415
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:10,170
Drop your weapon.

416
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:16,418
Stand away from the dish
or we'll open fire.

417
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:23,167
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds. Nine

418
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:26,345
Eight. Seven.

419
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:30,211
Six.

420
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:16,425
The Oscar winners
give a press conference ...

421
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:22,337
- Gloria, you look like shit.
- What happened?

422
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:27,468
All the sex and violence on the
screen has gone too far for me.

423
01:30:27,667 --> 01:30:34,585
I'm fed up with it. Film makers
have to show some restraint ...

424
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:50,423
What's wrong, baby?
