2
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,672
United 1523, did you hear your company...
Did you hear...

3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,424
We were just answering your call.

4
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,092
We did hear that yelling, too.

5
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,593
We couldn't tell what it was either.

6
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,928
United 93...

7
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,889
- Has he turned to the east now?
- Please state your emergency.

8
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,059
The flight attendant is advising our reps
that the pilot and everyone's been stabbed.

9
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,102
And we can't breathe.

10
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,729
I don't know. I think we're getting hijacked.

11
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,480
...hijacked aircraft headed towards New York.

12
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,566
- Is this real world or exercise?
- No, this is not an exercise.

13
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,109
Can anybody get up to the cockpit?

14
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,402
What's going on, Betty?

15
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,945
Betty, talk to me.

16
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,905
A plane just crashed
into the World Trade Center.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,574
I think we might have lost her.

18
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,284
Hey, Mom, I'm sure that you've heard

19
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,911
that a plane crashed
into World Trade Center One.

20
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,330
We're fine. We're in World Trade Center Two.

21
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,457
I'm on a plane that's been hijacked.

22
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,084
I hope to be able
to see your face again, baby.

23
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,461
I love you. Bye.

24
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,254
We got reports of another incoming plane.

25
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,922
We may have to take cover in the stairwell.

26
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,386
Lieutenant Brown, Ladder 18.
One of the towers just collapsed.

27
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:36,971
- Hello, ma'am?
- Help!

28
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,015
That towerjust came down
on top of everybody!

29
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,767
Are they gonna be able
to get somebody up here?

30
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,310
Of course, ma'am. We're coming up to you.

31
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,271
Well, there's no one here yet,
and the floor's completely engulfed.

32
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,106
We're on the floor and we can't breathe.

33
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,441
Hold on one second, please.

34
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,609
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

35
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,985
No, no, no, no, no, no!

36
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,320
- I'm gonna die.
- Ma'am...

37
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,155
I'm gonna die, I know it.

38
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,782
Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm.

39
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,116
Please, God.

40
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,576
You're doing a good job, ma'am.

41
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,119
You're doing a good job. You're doing fine.

42
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,038
It's so hot. I'm burning up.

43
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,457
Ma'am, you are fine.
They're gonna come get you.

44
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,417
Can anyone hear me?

45
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,835
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,733
I own you, Ammar.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,361
You belong to me.

48
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,572
Look at me.

49
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,328
If you don't look at me
when I talk to you, I hurt you!

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,664
You step off this mat, I hurt you!

51
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,250
If you lie to me, I'm gonna hurt you!

52
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,252
Now, now look at me!

53
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,588
Look at me, Ammar!

54
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,760
Come on.

55
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,453
Nobody talks to him.

56
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,913
Roger that.

57
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,958
Are we gonna board these
windows up or what?

58
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,340
Just off the plane from Washington.

59
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,636
Rocking your best suit
for your first interrogation.

60
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,763
And you get this guy.

61
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,433
They're not always this intense.

62
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,684
I'm fine.

63
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,440
Well, just so you know,
it's gonna take a while.

64
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,151
He has to learn how helpless he is.

65
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,907
Come on, let's get a coffee.

66
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,825
No, we should go back in.

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,336
There's no shame if you want
to watch from the monitor.

68
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:17,924
All right.

69
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,889
Might want to put this on.

70
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,849
You're not wearing one.

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,353
Is he ever getting out?

72
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,563
Never.

73
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,190
Let's go.

74
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,039
Right now,

75
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,375
all this is about, simply,

76
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,753
is you coming to terms with your situation.

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,714
It's you and me, bro.

78
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,760
I want you to understand that I know you,

79
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,724
that I've been studying
and following you for a very long time.

80
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,060
I could've had you killed in Karachi,

81
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,814
but I didn't, I let you live,
so that you and I could talk.

82
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,067
Then you beat me when my hands are tied.

83
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,528
So I won't talk to you.

84
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,572
Well, life isn't always fair, my friend.

85
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:28,619
Did you really think that when we got you,
I would be a nice fucking guy?

86
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,413
You're a mid-level guy.

87
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,624
You're a garbage man in the corporation!

88
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,626
Why should I respect you, huh?

89
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,294
Why?

90
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,672
And you're a money man.

91
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,258
Paperboy.

92
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,926
A disgrace to humanity.

93
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,221
You and your uncle
murdered 3,000 innocent people.

94
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,266
Yeah.

95
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:58,274
I have your name on a $5,000 transfer
via Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker.

96
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,611
And you got popped with

97
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:07,992
150 kilograms of high explosives
in your house!

98
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,621
And then you dare question me?

99
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,962
Come on, man, I'm fucking with you.

100
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,717
I don't want to talk about 9/11 yet.

101
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:30,139
What I want to focus on is the Saudi group.

102
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:39,190
That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri.

103
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,151
And I know this dude is
up to some serious shit.

104
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,321
What I want from you is his Saudi e-mail.

105
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,617
Ammar, bro, I know that you know this dude.

106
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,578
Just give me his e-mail
and I will give you a blanket.

107
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,207
I will give you a blanket and some solid food.

108
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,921
I know that you know him.

109
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,050
I told you before, I won't talk to you.

110
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,390
Have it your way. Let's go.

111
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,685
Come on.

112
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,190
When you lie to me,

113
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,650
I hurt you.

114
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,130
Grab me the bucket.

115
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,174
Come on, grab the bucket!

116
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,098
Put some water in it.

117
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,893
Come on, let's go!

118
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,982
Come on, give it to me.

119
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,988
Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef.

120
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,157
You guys met in Iran, back in the '90s.

121
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,075
I don't know!

122
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,496
Fuck you!

123
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,671
Give me the e-mails
of the rest of the Saudi group.

124
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,632
Give me one e-mail and I will stop this!

125
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,677
Who's in the Saudi group?

126
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,762
And what's the target?

127
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,932
Where was the last time you saw bin Laden?

128
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,269
Where was the last time
you saw bin Laden, huh?

129
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,273
You know, when you lie to me, I hurt you.

130
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,035
This is what defeat looks like, bro.

131
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,828
Yourjihad is over.

132
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,874
Get him up.

133
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,012
Try to understand the concept here.

134
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,972
Okay, I have time, you don't.

135
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,601
I have other things to do, but you don't.

136
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,608
It's cool that you're strong. I respect it, I do.

137
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,111
But in the end, everybody breaks, bro.

138
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,738
It's biology.

139
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,121
Can you open the trunk, ma'am?

140
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:27,876
It's clear.

141
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,345
How'd it go the other night?

142
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,430
It was good. I mean, the local cops needed

143
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,724
a little tactical help,
but he's Tier fucking One, baby.

144
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,017
That's your moneymaker right there.

145
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,352
And this is the guy that's K.S.M.'s nephew?

146
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,436
- Yeah.
- What's his issue?

147
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,562
He's being a dick.

148
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,482
If he's trying to outsmart you,
why don't you tell him about your Ph.D.

149
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,318
Yeah. No, but I am gonna have to
turn up the heat on this asshole.

150
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,278
He needs to give up the Saudi group now.

151
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,863
He's got to have that, given the family ties.

152
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,033
He's tight with his uncle,
he's got his prints all over the 9/11 money.

153
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,077
He's got them in his head,
he needs to disclose them.

154
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,286
All right.

155
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,288
Good.

156
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,623
Bill, she's good to go.

157
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,166
I'll get her the right one tomorrow.

158
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,878
Was I lying or what?

159
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,384
Maya, this is Joseph Bradley,
our illustrious station chief.

160
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,551
Joe and I did Iraq together.

161
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,594
It's nice to meet you.

162
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,845
You, too, sir.

163
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,431
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

164
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,475
And she's been having
a great time since she got in.

165
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,893
Isn't that right?

166
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,812
Good. How do you like Pakistan so far?

167
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,563
It's kind of fucked up.

168
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,899
You volunteered for this, didn't you?

169
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,109
No.

170
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,074
Third floor, northeast corner.

171
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,126
You don't think she's a little
young for the hard stuff?

172
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,753
Washington says she's a killer.

173
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,172
Children's Crusade, huh?

174
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,091
They want to put the next generation
on the field.

175
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,093
Listen, I've got a meeting
with ISI in 20 minutes.

176
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,054
They're slow-rolling us in Lahore,
you might want to bitch about that.

177
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,079
My fellow Americans...

178
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,122
Did I tell you this?

179
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,292
That this dude in Malaysia,
he tells the Malaysian station

180
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,879
that his nephew works with a guy
who knows a guy...

181
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,505
- Here we go.
- Hold on.

182
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,926
He goes to a big feast
in Bangkok about a year ago.

183
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,219
Guest of honor?

184
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,929
Usama bin Laden.

185
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,556
I said, "Was Tupac there, too?"

186
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,016
This is worth five million bucks.

187
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,934
You know we're gonna
have to chase it down.

188
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,603
Hey, that's me, man, no job too small.

189
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,480
That's why I have a gift for you, my friend.

190
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,315
- Everyone, this is Maya.
- Hey.

191
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,358
Maya, everyone.
Please don't ask her how it's going

192
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,402
with Ammar,
'cause she's not gonna fucking tell you.

193
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,070
Ammar is withholding?

194
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,950
Washington assesses Abu Faraj
is officially our new number three.

195
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,577
He's the best man for it.

196
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:54,458
Yeah, the London station's already asking
if he's contacting anybody in the U.K.

197
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,293
- Like we're just keeping it from them?
- Yeah.

198
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,421
Jordanians are being really helpful
with Ammar's transit papers.

199
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,089
Any imminent threats in here?

200
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,468
They want a consulate,
a Marriott, it's low security.

201
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,347
And they've got Majid Kahn
talking about gas stations in the U.S.

202
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,599
And that's a conversation?

203
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,351
Honestly, there are 600 questions in there.

204
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,102
I'd do Heathrow, the Saudis...

205
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,813
Does it matter what Faraj
thinks about Heathrow?

206
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,357
How much latitude
does he get to pick targets?

207
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,525
I think he'll give up the Saudis,

208
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,276
but Heathrow's gonna be tough.

209
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,737
Anyway, anything from last night?

210
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,532
Quetta base thinks they have
a bead on the Arabs that escaped.

211
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,825
They're meeting with ISI this afternoon,
hopefully set up

212
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,702
- a raid down there.
- Great.

213
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,831
And Lahore reporting ISI was
painfully slow last night, again.

214
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,333
They're beginning to think
it's not incompetence.

215
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,669
I agree. I spoke to the chief about that.

216
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,170
- Yeah.
- Anything on bin Laden?

217
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,631
A farmer on the Afghan border
near Tora Bora reports

218
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,551
"a diamond-shaped pattern in the hills,
tall male in the center of the diamond

219
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,387
"flanked by four guards."
Consistent with UBL's movements.

220
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,888
That's supposed to be his royal guard?

221
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,598
No, that's pre-9/11 behavior.

222
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,685
We have no reason to believe
he's changed security tactics.

223
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,311
We invaded Afghanistan, that's a reason.

224
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,733
Hey, boss, I got a guy, for $5,000 bucks,

225
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,027
he can set up a taxi stand
and snoop around a bit.

226
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,573
No. Don't need him.
Sorry, the diamond sighting's bullshit.

227
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,659
See if the Paks will send someone
to talk to the farmer.

228
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,995
Anything else? No?

229
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,582
All right, let's put some runs on the board
against Faraj, okay?

230
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,544
Talk to the case officers who didn't see fit
to make it today and thank them.

231
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,338
Tora Bora?

232
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,923
Yeah. Good.

233
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,190
Come on. Here we go. Here we go.

234
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,323
Let's just...

235
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,241
Let's take it easy today, huh?

236
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,264
Hungry?

237
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,852
The food in here sucks,
so I got you some of this.

238
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,238
Good, huh?

239
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,165
Richard Reid.

240
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,460
Oh, man, I was thinking about him.

241
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,506
Guy gets a bomb in a shoe on a plane.
Un-fucking-believable.

242
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,426
You know him, don't you?

243
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,597
Yes.

244
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,809
I'm glad you said that.

245
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,689
I got an e-mail from you to him.

246
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,359
I got all your coms for years, bro.

247
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,821
Who...

248
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,283
Who else is in your Saudi group?

249
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,162
I just handed out some cash for them.

250
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,417
I didn't know who the guys were.

251
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,173
When you lie to me, I hurt you.

252
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,468
Please.

253
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,811
I believe you.

254
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,564
I do, I believe you.

255
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,236
Good, huh?

256
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,620
Do you want the water again?

257
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,247
Or do you want something else?

258
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,172
Water?

259
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,340
Please.

260
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,884
Just give me a name.

261
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,429
I don't know.

262
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,433
I don't know! I don't know!

263
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,769
Come on, let's go.

264
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,230
Bring him up.

265
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,232
Here we go.

266
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,983
You see how this works?

267
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,908
You don't mind if my female colleague there
checks out yourjunk, do you?

268
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,992
No?

269
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,202
Good.

270
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,248
Dude, you shit your pants?

271
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,876
You stay here. I'll be back.

272
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,392
Your friend is an animal.

273
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,813
Please, help me.

274
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,107
Please.

275
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,117
You can help yourself by being truthful.

276
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,089
This is a dog collar.

277
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,219
- No!
- Come on.

278
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,387
No!

279
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,889
Come on. Come on.

280
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,683
There you go. There you go.

281
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,688
You determine how I treat you.

282
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,322
Come on. Come on.

283
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,325
I got you.

284
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:54,502
Come on.

285
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,838
You're my dog, I gotta walk you.

286
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,759
What the fuck
do you think is going on, Ammar?

287
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,261
Wahleed has already told me that you know.

288
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,349
Here we go. Come on, you're almost there.

289
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,976
There we go. There we go.

290
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:15,357
All right. This box here, this box sucks.

291
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,443
Now, I'm gonna put you in it.

292
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:29,663
When is the attack?

293
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,751
What? What?

294
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,711
Sunday.

295
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,006
Sunday where? No, whoa, whoa.
Sunday where?

296
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,427
Sunday? This Sunday or next Sunday?

297
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,098
Where? Where?

298
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,392
Monday.

299
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,726
What?

300
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:53,979
Tuesday.

301
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,439
Come on, Ammar, is it Sunday or Monday?

302
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,068
Partial information will be treated as a lie.

303
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,903
- Come on, let's go.
- Thursday.

304
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,446
Come on, which day is it?

305
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,574
Partial information,
you're gonna go in the box!

306
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,911
Partial information is treated as a lie!

307
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,246
Let's go!

308
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,331
- Saturday!
- In the box you go.

309
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,666
In the box you go.

310
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,668
Saturday!

311
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,836
Come on.

312
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,754
Monday!

313
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,091
Tuesday!

314
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,552
- There we go.
- Friday!

315
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,887
Come on, let's go, come on!

316
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,099
Hang on, hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

317
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,183
Sunday.

318
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,146
Monday.

319
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,692
Thursday.

320
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,153
Ammar, which day is it?

321
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,362
Tuesday.

322
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,989
Which day?

323
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,704
Friday.

324
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,166
Ammar, which day?

325
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,917
Thursday.

326
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,630
Friday.

327
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,910
...a targeted attack
against Westerners and foreigners.

328
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,413
When you look at the breakup of casualties,
you can see

329
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,875
that non-Muslims were killed
and so were Americans.

330
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,796
Don't worry about the Saudis.
They'll take care of business.

331
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,214
Yeah, now.

332
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,634
You warned them,
they didn't take you seriously.

333
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,427
This is what happens. It's not on you.

334
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:52,097
Who said that, huh, Zeid? Fuck him.
This is on me.

335
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,307
- Ammar is on me. And it's on her.
- No, no, no, no.

336
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,768
You had what,
days, brief custody, unresponsive ally?

337
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,436
We cannot let this be a win-win for A.Q.

338
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,480
The way you do this is look ahead.

339
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,149
London, Heathrow, mass casualties.
That plan is still active.

340
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,110
Ammar doesn't have a clue
about what happened.

341
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,903
- He knows.
- How?

342
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,615
You have to be really careful with people
in K.S.M.'s circle, they're devious.

343
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,659
He's not gonna talk about
attacks on the homeland.

344
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:17,330
He's gonna withhold operational details on
the K.S.M. network and probably bin Laden.

345
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,250
But he's been in complete isolation.

346
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,168
He doesn't know we failed.
We could tell him anything.

347
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,462
What, bluff him?

348
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,048
He hasn't slept, Dan. He's clueless.

349
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,014
You don't remember, do you?

350
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,976
Well, short-term memory loss is
a side effect of sleep deprivation,

351
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,978
so it should come back to you.

352
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,399
I don't know.

353
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,610
How can I remember?

354
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,946
After we kept you awake for 96 hours,

355
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,740
you gave us the name of
some of your brothers,

356
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,161
and you helped save the lives
of a lot of innocent people.

357
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,497
Which is the smart thing to do.
You're starting to think for yourself.

358
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,208
Come on, eat up, man.

359
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,503
Some hummus. Tabouleh.
Don't know what that is.

360
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:08,047
Some figs. You earned it.

361
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:17,056
So, you flew via Amman to Kabul, yeah?

362
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:22,020
Hang out with your uncle. Mukhtar.

363
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,606
How did you know that?

364
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,108
Told you, man, I know you.

365
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,111
All right, you got me. You did, you got me.

366
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,529
Flight manifests.

367
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,284
It must be pretty fucked up
for you guys after 9/11.

368
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:41,206
What'd you do after the invasion?
Before you went back to Pesh.

369
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,959
After 9/11, we had to choose,

370
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,961
fight to protect our turf, or run.

371
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,131
And you chose to fight, yeah?

372
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,927
We wanted to kill Americans.

373
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,220
Yeah.

374
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,765
We tried to get into Tora Bora,
but the bombing was too high.

375
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,391
We couldn't cross.

376
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,394
I'm sorry, who's the "we" in that sentence?

377
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,942
Me and some other guys who were
hanging around at that time.

378
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,070
You know, I can always go
and eat with some other dude,

379
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,739
hang you back up to the ceiling.

380
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,244
Hamza Rabia.

381
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,043
Khabab al-Masri.

382
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,425
And Abu Ahmed.

383
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,516
Who's Abu Ahmed?
I've heard of the other guys.

384
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,103
He was a computer guy with us at the time.

385
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:52,694
After Tora Bora, I went back to Pesh,
as you know.

386
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,446
And he went north, I think.

387
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,698
To Kunar.

388
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,324
What's his family name?

389
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,411
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

390
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:07,125
Abu Ahmed means "father ofAhmed."
It's a kunya.

391
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,794
Ammar, I know the difference between
a war name and an Arabic name.

392
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,005
She got you there, dude.

393
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:16,551
I swear to you both,
I don't know his family name.

394
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,554
I would have never asked him
something like that.

395
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,639
It's not how my uncle worked.

396
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,266
I know.

397
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,895
My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden.

398
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,778
I did see him once.
About a year ago, in Karachi.

399
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,619
He read us all a letter from the Sheik.

400
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,246
A letter?

401
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,998
What'd it say?

402
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,416
Cigarette?

403
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:05,933
He said, "Continue the jihad.
The work will go on for a hundred years."

404
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,859
You and I are gonna talk about some of
the guys in the training camps. Yeah?

405
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,652
Okay.

406
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,697
Some of these brothers
have done some bad things.

407
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:24,410
What I want to do is I want to separate them
from the people like you.

408
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,037
Definitely, yeah.

409
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,541
All right, a guy
called Abu Ahmed from Kuwait.

410
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,959
Yes, I remember him.

411
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,252
A nice guy.

412
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,714
How close was he?
What was his relationship to the leadership?

413
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,716
- I don't know.
- Did he eat with you guys?

414
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,843
Did he eat with the good guys
or did he eat with the leadership?

415
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,720
I don't know, sir. I have no idea about...

416
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,056
Yes, you do. You don't need an idea about...

417
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,978
When you met Khalid Shaikh Mohammed,

418
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:54,190
was this one of the facilitators?

419
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,943
Is this Abu Ahmed?

420
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,113
Yes.

421
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,494
K.S.M., your boss.

422
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,246
I call him Mukhtar.

423
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,706
Mukhtar. "Po-tay-to," you say "po-tah-to."

424
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,334
I say "fucking K.S.M.,"
you say "Mukhtar," okay?

425
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,211
After Mukhtar was captured,

426
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,380
what did Abu Ahmed do?

427
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,714
Abu Ahmed, I believe...

428
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,385
I believe he went to work for the Sheik.

429
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,769
In Karachi in 2003, or 2004.

430
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:35,148
He was carrying a letter from bin Laden?

431
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,035
Is that him?

432
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,373
- Is that him?
- Abu Ahmed.

433
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,043
- Say it again?
- Abu Ahmed.

434
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,297
Abu Ahmed. Abu Ahmed.

435
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,718
Abu Ahmed.

436
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,098
Who knows who works directly
for bin Laden.

437
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,268
Let's say he's part of the mix.

438
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,230
Were there other people
who carried messages from bin Laden?

439
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,483
Sure.

440
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,738
How many other people?

441
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,949
Let's talk about them.

442
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,298
How's the needle in the haystack?

443
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,717
Fine.

444
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,095
Facilitators come and go.

445
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,641
One thing you can count on in life
is that everyone wants money.

446
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:55,603
You're assuming that al-Qaeda members
are motivated by financial rewards.

447
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,605
They're radicals.

448
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,565
Correct.

449
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,860
You're assuming that
greed won't override ideology

450
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,779
in some of the weaker members.

451
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,781
Money for walk-ins worked
great in the Cold War,

452
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,949
I'll give you that.

453
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,909
Thank you.

454
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,117
He says he looks like Abu Ahmed.

455
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:52,827
Who did he work for?

456
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,464
It was mostly with Abu Faraj.

457
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,300
They were always together.

458
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,302
What did he do for Faraj?

459
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,854
He carried messages from Faraj to bin Laden

460
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,148
and from bin Laden back to Faraj.

461
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,358
We need to ask him something to
see if he's telling the truth.

462
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,278
We don't know if he really knew Faraj.

463
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:42,209
He just told me the names of
all ofAbu Faraj's children.

464
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,253
I think he's telling the truth.

465
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,967
20 detainees recognize
that photo ofAbu Ahmed.

466
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,594
They say he's part of an inner circle of guys

467
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,638
that was hanging out
in Afghanistan pre-9/11.

468
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,641
A lot of them say that after 9/11,
he went to work for K.S.M.

469
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,602
When K.S.M. was captured,
he went to work for Abu Faraj,

470
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,438
primarily as a courier
from Faraj to bin Laden.

471
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,939
Well, that's good, but you still...

472
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,941
Yeah, but we don't know ifAbu's
on the outside of the network,

473
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,360
a series of cutouts and dead drops,

474
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,904
or if he has a direct connection to bin Laden.

475
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,156
I mean, does bin Laden
invite him into the living room

476
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,951
and hand him a letter directly or is Abu
just the last guy in a long line of couriers,

477
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,078
and that's why everybody knows him?

478
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,204
That's not all you don't know.

479
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,998
You don't have his real name,
you don't have a clue of where he is.

480
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,333
Yes, but we know that he's important.

481
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,043
The fact that everybody's
heard ofAbu Ahmed,

482
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,671
but nobody will tell me
where he is suggests that.

483
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,547
Maybe.

484
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,883
Detainees could withhold his location
for any number of reasons.

485
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,009
Perhaps they don't know.

486
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:35,971
Perhaps this Abu is actually a cover story
and he's really a fucking unicorn.

487
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,433
But the withholding doesn't reveal
what you want it to, does it?

488
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,687
No.

489
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,815
And if you did find him,
you don't know that he'd be with bin Laden.

490
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,233
We don't know what we don't know.

491
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,859
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

492
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,489
It's a tautology.

493
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,453
Listen, not one single detainee has said
that he's been located with the big guy,

494
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,247
just that he delivers messages, am I wrong?

495
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,792
- No.
- No.

496
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,671
It's still good work.

497
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,340
Let me know when you get
some actionable intelligence.

498
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,384
Preferably something that leads to a strike.

499
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,843
This is what remains of the number 10 bus,

500
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,305
which was traveling through
Tavistock Square near Euston Station.

501
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,599
There'd been explosions

502
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:05,394
near Liverpool Street
and Edgware Road stations, too.

503
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,105
Dozens of the survivors
were critically injured,

504
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,734
but many of the wounded were also
keen to share their stories.

505
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,737
We'd just pulled out of Edgware Road.

506
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,992
And next thing I know, there's a loud...
A large flash of light.

507
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,829
Felt a burning sensation on my hands,
put my hands up to my face.

508
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,750
I was on the floor by that point.

509
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:33,172
Yeah, I can't recall anything prior to that,
any noise, any bang.

510
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:37,259
Normal life in one of the busiest parts
of the capital has now been suspended,

511
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:41,347
as just a few yards down the road here
they continue to care for the injured.

512
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:46,310
And all around, groups of Londoners
are standing on corners, asking themselves

513
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,230
what has happened here
and who could possibly have done this.

514
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,071
Come on.

515
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,206
You, too. Come on.

516
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,177
You Agency guys are twisted.

517
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,763
Detainee's ready for you.

518
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,646
Come on.

519
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,797
I want you to understand that I know you.

520
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,383
I've been following you
and studying you for a long time.

521
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,051
I chased you in Lahore.

522
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,721
I had you picked up instead of killing you
because you're not a violent man

523
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,306
and you don't deserve to die.

524
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,516
Thank you.

525
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,518
But you do have deep ties to al-Qaeda

526
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:10,811
I want to ask you about

527
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,690
before you get sent to your next location,
which might be Israel.

528
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,067
However, depending on how
candid you are here today,

529
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,654
I may be able to keep you in Pakistan.

530
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,990
What do you want to know?

531
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:27,161
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions
based on your knowledge of al-Qaeda

532
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,164
and your position as key financier
for the organization.

533
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,333
I have dealt with the Mukhabarat.

534
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,628
I have no wish to be tortured again.

535
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,671
Ask me a question, I will answer it.

536
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,342
What can you tell me
about Atiyah Abd al-Rahman?

537
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,761
He works for Zawahiri.

538
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,014
He's in charge of military tactics.

539
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:51,185
In what context have you ever
heard the name Abu Ahmed?

540
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,440
He works for Faraj and bin Laden.

541
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,234
He is his most trusted courier.

542
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,656
What makes you say that?

543
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,034
He brought me many messages
from the Sheik.

544
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,959
Where did you last see him
and where is he now?

545
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,962
You will never find him.

546
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,546
Why is that?

547
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,548
Even I couldn't find him.

548
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,718
He always contacted me out of the blue.

549
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,555
He is one of the disappeared ones.

550
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,524
You know how this works?

551
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,402
God willing, we won't have to use it.

552
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,215
Just act naturally.

553
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,879
You're in luck.
I got you a one-on-one with Faraj.

554
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,131
Seriously? Thank you!

555
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,424
Don't you thank me until
you hear what I want for it.

556
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:12,386
I want you to take care of all this
before your favorite subject.

557
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,887
Deal.

558
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,476
Don't you want to see what's in the folder?

559
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:24,064
You want family ties, financial networks,
media sources, disgruntled employees,

560
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,774
imminent threats, homeland plots,

561
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,277
foreign sales, health status,
financial resources...

562
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,361
Thank you!

563
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,363
...tradecraft, recruiting tactics.
Anything else?

564
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,656
No, I think that covers it.

565
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,116
Yeah.

566
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,037
"If what they say is true,

567
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,291
"the Shaolin and the Wu Tang
could be dangerous."

568
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,460
What do you like to be called? Faraj? Farij?

569
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,337
Fuzzy? Come on.

570
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,673
Hey, what do you like? You like a bit of...

571
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,010
You guys like a bit of Bob Marley?
Bit of reggae?

572
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,137
Kick back, take it easy after
you've blown some shit up?

573
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,349
No?

574
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,603
You got some Libyan music you like?

575
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,404
You did the U.K. bombings, right?

576
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,115
You know, you're the second
number three I've captured.

577
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,075
I got K.S.M.

578
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,585
Can I be honest with you?

579
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,298
I'm bad fuckin' news.

580
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,967
I'm not your friend.

581
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,137
I'm not gonna help you.

582
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,140
I'm gonna break you.

583
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,185
Any questions?

584
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,604
No?

585
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,066
All right, you haven't eaten in 18 hours.
We need to keep your energy up.

586
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,109
You hungry?

587
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,994
A lot of brothers told us Abu Ahmed
was bin Laden's courier

588
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,829
and that he worked very closely with you.

589
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,959
You are thinking ofAbu Khalid.

590
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,086
Who?

591
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,254
Al-Baluchi.

592
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,839
My courier for the Sheik.

593
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,468
Okay.

594
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,763
So you're telling me
all the other brothers are wrong

595
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,057
and there's some famous Baluchi guy

596
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,559
working for you and bin Laden
that I've never even heard of.

597
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,478
Why should you have heard of him?

598
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,522
What does this Baluchi guy look like?

599
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,484
Tall. Long white beard.

600
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:34,945
Thin.

601
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:36,613
He uses a cane.

602
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,740
Kind of like Gandalf.

603
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,659
Who?

604
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,245
When was the last time you saw him?

605
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,291
A month ago. In Karachi.

606
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,293
But I don't know where he is now.

607
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,713
Sometimes, I wouldn't even see him.

608
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:57,843
He would just tell me
where to leave the messages.

609
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,515
You're not being fulsome in your replies.

610
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,810
You cannot force me to tell you
something I don't know.

611
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,604
You do realize this is not a normal prison.

612
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,481
You determine how you're treated.

613
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:17,029
And your life is gonna be very uncomfortable
until you give me the information I need.

614
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,284
Where exactly is
Abu Ahmed living at the moment?

615
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,965
Faraj is completely denying
knowing Abu Ahmed.

616
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,511
That's using every measure we have.

617
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,180
Well, he's either gonna keep withholding

618
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,433
or he's gonna die from the pressure
you're putting on him.

619
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,186
Hey, you want to take a run at him?

620
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,272
No.

621
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,816
- No?
- No.

622
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,443
Since when no?

623
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:00,739
You know, I was meaning to tell you,
I'm getting out of here.

624
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,617
You okay?

625
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,285
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just...

626
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,789
You know, I think I've seen
too many guys naked.

627
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,625
It's got to be over a fucking hundred
at this point.

628
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,628
I need to go and do something normal
for a while.

629
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,213
Like what?

630
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,548
Go to Washington.

631
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,258
Do the dance,
see how that environment works.

632
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,136
You should come with me.

633
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:27,307
Yeah, be my number two.
You're looking a little strung out yourself.

634
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,271
I'm not gonna find Abu Ahmed from D.C.

635
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,821
They killed my monkeys.

636
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,325
Some bullshit about escaping.
You fucking believe that?

637
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,832
- Sorry, Dan.
- Yeah, I know.

638
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:56,169
Look, Maya, you got to be real
careful with the detainees now.

639
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,629
Okay? Politics are changing,

640
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,089
and you don't want to be the last one

641
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,675
holding a dog collar when
the oversight committee comes.

642
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,053
- I know.
- Yeah?

643
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,181
And watch your back
when you get back to Pakistan.

644
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,267
Everyone knows you there now.

645
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,154
Sorry.

646
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,989
Fucking checkpoints.

647
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,242
- Maya?
- Yeah?

648
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,786
We're socializing. Be social.

649
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,165
Okay.

650
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:23,215
Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby,
but it is time to cut the umbilical cord.

651
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,508
No, it's not.

652
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,593
So Faraj went south on you, it happens.

653
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:31,014
There are still cells in London and Spain
who are planning the next round of attacks.

654
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,682
I can work on it at the same time.

655
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,686
- Plus, I think it's a good thing he lied.
- No.

656
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:39,773
Not at the expense of protecting
the homeland, you can't...

657
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,650
Wait a minute, why is it a good thing?

658
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,402
You sound just like Bradley,
he doesn't believe in my lead, either.

659
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,784
It's a good thing because the fact that

660
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,662
Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed
is very revealing.

661
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:57,874
The only other thing Faraj lied about
was the location of bin Laden himself.

662
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:03,296
That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed
is just as important to protect as bin Laden.

663
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,424
That confirms my lead.

664
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,134
Or it's confirmation bias.

665
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,890
We're just worried about you, okay?

666
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:15,350
Is that okay to say?

667
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,020
I mean, look how run-down you are.

668
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,821
Where's Jack?

669
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,741
Probably stuck in
some checkpoint somewhere.

670
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,243
You two hooked up yet?

671
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,913
Hello, I work with him.
I'm not that girl that fucks.

672
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,415
It's unbecoming.

673
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,335
So? Little fooling around wouldn't hurt you.

674
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,923
So no boyfriend.

675
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,428
You got any friends at all?

676
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,893
It's Jack.

677
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:00,937
Hey.

678
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,981
That's okay.

679
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:04,524
He's stuck in traffic.

680
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:29,633
Come on!

681
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,227
There's an exit!

682
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,984
Oh, no! Shit.

683
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,111
Come on, over here!

684
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,297
The blast left a crater 10 meters,
or 30 feet wide, in front of the hotel.

685
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,966
Police tell CNN the driver of the truck bomb

686
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:15,637
tried to talk his way past
the hotel's steel security gate.

687
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,014
When armed guards said no,
police said the driver

688
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:21,226
detonated more than
2,000 pounds of explosives.

689
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,771
The Marriott, one of the most
popular destinations for locals

690
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,857
and Westerners in Islamabad, now destroyed.

691
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:58,722
The Jords have a mole!

692
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,515
What?

693
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,435
He made this video to prove his bona fides.

694
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,602
Shut up!

695
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,731
Humam Khalil al-Balawi.

696
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,566
He's a Jordanian doctor.

697
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,653
He's right there in the inner circle.

698
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:16,531
I don't buy it.

699
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,533
Didn't you tell me yourself
nobody turns on al-Qaeda?

700
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,452
The Jords have worked him
for a year, dinners, money.

701
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:24,622
They convinced him it's his patriotic duty
to turn on al-Qaeda and get rich doing it.

702
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,291
Yeah, well, so the Jords say.

703
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,500
Yeah, you're right.

704
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,294
We can't rely on this or the Jords.

705
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,337
We've got to evaluate him face-to-face.

706
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,089
He may not be that smart.
He may be full of shit.

707
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,258
But we have to talk to him and find out.

708
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:39,846
The key is to meet him, so we can figure out
for ourselves what he can actually do.

709
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,482
He really asked for a dialysis machine?

710
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:56,154
Maybe we can fill
the damn thing with poison.

711
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:05,079
The meeting with Balawi's off.

712
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,372
He can't come to Islamabad.

713
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,124
Can't or won't?

714
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,876
He's not gonna travel.

715
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,212
Security risk.

716
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:16,591
I've said repeatedly
that America doesn't torture.

717
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,176
And I'm gonna make sure
that we don't torture.

718
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,638
Those are part and parcel of an effort

719
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:26,810
to regain America's
moral stature in the world.

720
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,770
Can you give us some sense
of when you might start...

721
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:32,065
He wants us to go to him.

722
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:36,152
He'll meet us in Miranshah with the Tribals.

723
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,613
He knows we're white.
We'd get kidnapped there.

724
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,240
Maybe do it somewhere else.

725
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,785
Germany or the U.K.?
He's got a clean passport.

726
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,830
He's not gonna travel out
of al-Qaeda territory.

727
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,164
And you're not going to him.

728
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:49,499
I'm not, believe me.

729
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,210
We're stuck.

730
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,507
What about Camp Chapman?

731
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,842
Afghanistan.

732
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,678
That could be safe territory.

733
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:15,441
This may be going overboard,
but I baked him a cake.

734
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,652
Muslims don't celebrate with cake.

735
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,280
Don't be so literal, everyone likes cake.

736
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,199
It's not too late for you to come, you know.
It'll be fun.

737
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,702
No, I don't want to be a straphanger.

738
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:28,413
It's your show, you were the first
to see the potential in this.

739
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,081
Come on!

740
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,250
We've got lots of wine.

741
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,127
Cool. Bring me back a bottle.

742
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,088
I will do.

743
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:44,304
Not to get technical, but this guy is actually
the first big break we've had since 9/11.

744
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,308
To big breaks
and the little people that make them happen.

745
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,232
So far, everything he's said
we've cross-checked, and it's proved legit.

746
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:59,527
And I think the money is persuasive.

747
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,156
$25 million?

748
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,659
That buys a new life.

749
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,496
Do you think he might be
exaggerating his access?

750
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,248
Possibly.

751
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:16,586
But al-Qaeda needs doctors,
and they are short-staffed,

752
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,172
and that could explain his rise.

753
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,760
In six months to a year, if he doesn't fuck up,

754
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:27,180
he could be called in to treat bin Laden.

755
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,809
At that moment, with 25 mil on the table,

756
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:35,021
I think he gives up the big man.

757
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,981
And if he doesn't, we kill him.

758
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,038
- John?
- Yeah.

759
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,915
When he arrives, let me set the tone,

760
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,251
and then I'll flip it to you
and you can talk about asset protection.

761
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,336
Roger that.

762
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,338
Lauren.

763
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,799
I know you want to get some questions
in there,

764
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:07,053
but give Balawi a little time
after John speaks.

765
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,055
We'll cover the basics,
have his birthday cake,

766
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,557
then we'll get into the nitty-gritty.

767
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:15,478
Is that order okay?
Or do you want to introduce everyone?

768
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,232
I'll introduce you, you introduce your team.
He knows this is a high-level meeting.

769
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,817
Quick question.

770
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,361
All this taking place
inside our main building?

771
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,279
Right. And, Lauren,

772
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:29,409
Washington will want real-time updates,
so please stay on top of that.

773
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,618
Be concise.

774
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:32,954
The director's in the loop.

775
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:38,251
And I wouldn't be surprised
if he doesn't update the President.

776
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,794
Yeah, I'm on it.

777
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,548
Now, I just got to get his ass down here.

778
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,489
Why are there gate guards there?
We talked about this.

779
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,407
No one is supposed to be there
when my source arrives.

780
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:34,700
You might have spooked him already.

781
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,285
Well, procedures only work

782
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,412
- if we follow them every time.
- This is different!

783
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:42,125
I'm sorry I can't explain,
but it's for a good cause.

784
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:44,836
Look, I'm responsible
for everybody's safety, okay?

785
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,045
It's not just about you.

786
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,839
I just need them to go away for a minute.

787
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,925
You can search him as soon as he gets here.

788
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,889
All stations, this is Whiplash.

789
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,016
Go ahead and stand down.

790
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,601
Copy that.

791
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,625
Thank you.

792
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,004
Okay, he's coming.

793
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,799
We're gonna search him when he gets here.

794
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,343
Sure.

795
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,589
Okay, let's go!

796
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,233
Is he supposed to limp like that?

797
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,902
Get your hand out of your pocket.

798
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,195
Hey.

799
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:18,823
- Hey!
- Get your hand out of your pocket!

800
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:19,907
- Hey!
- Do it now!

801
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,033
- Come on.
- Do it now!

802
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,141
The CIA says seven of its employees

803
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,435
were killed and six others
wounded in a suicide bombing

804
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,228
at a base in Afghanistan.

805
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:52,231
It was one of the deadliest
attacks in CIA history.

806
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,150
The Associated Press
has learned that the chief

807
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,902
of the CIA's post in the province
is among the victims.

808
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,572
Former officials say
she was the mother of three.

809
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,658
The Taliban claim responsibility
for the bombing...

810
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,627
You okay?

811
01:01:56,171 --> 01:02:00,383
I didn't think this day could get any worse,

812
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,888
but bad news from Saudi intelligence.

813
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,643
The courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead.

814
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,604
It's a detainee video.

815
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:38,671
He's dead.

816
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:41,674
In Afghanistan. 2001.

817
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,426
I buried him with my own hands.

818
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:46,887
He's dead.

819
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,097
In Afghanistan. 2001.

820
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,807
No.

821
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,434
Where was this?

822
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,269
Kabul.

823
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:56,105
No, I don't believe this. I don't believe this.

824
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,108
Sorry, Maya.

825
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,902
I always liked this lead.

826
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,197
Fuck.

827
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:29,180
Sorry, I just got here.

828
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,608
What are you gonna do?

829
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,618
I'm gonna smoke everybody
involved in this op

830
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,872
and then I'm gonna kill bin Laden.

831
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:08,719
Right.

832
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,911
I want to make something absolutely clear.

833
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:41,001
If you thought there was some
secret cell somewhere, working al-Qaeda,

834
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:44,255
then I want you to know that you're wrong.

835
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:47,716
This is it.

836
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,720
There's no working group
coming to the rescue.

837
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:56,892
There's nobody else hidden away
on some other floor.

838
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,978
There is just us.

839
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,439
And we are failing.

840
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,653
We're spending billions of dollars.

841
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,072
People are dying!

842
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:14,743
We are still no closer to defeating our enemy.

843
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,581
They attacked us!

844
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,750
On land, in '98.

845
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,419
By sea, in 2000.

846
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:26,589
And from the air, in 2001.

847
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:33,137
They murdered 3,000
of our citizens in cold blood.

848
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:37,474
And they have slaughtered
our forward deployed!

849
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,935
And what the fuck
have we done about it, huh?

850
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,523
What have we done?

851
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:50,946
We have 20 leadership names,
we've only eliminated four of them!

852
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,077
I want targets.

853
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,540
Do your fucking jobs.
Bring me people to kill.

854
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,903
Hi. I painstakingly combed through
everything in the system and found this.

855
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,657
It's him.

856
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:39,328
He was one of 10 names on a watch list
sent to us by the Moroccans after 9/11.

857
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,788
Ibrahim Sayeed.

858
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,289
They told us to watch out for him.

859
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:45,668
Apparently, they think his whole family
and extended family is bad

860
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,711
and has ties to K.S.M.

861
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:50,839
He was picked up for fake papers
and a doctored exit visa

862
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,633
leaving Afghanistan,
traveling through Morocco

863
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,967
en route to Kuwait.

864
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:56,762
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

865
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,847
This must be Abu Ahmed.

866
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:08,107
Doesn't matter,
but I wish I had that five years ago.

867
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,693
How come I never saw it before?

868
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,945
Nobody saw it, most likely.

869
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:16,740
There was a lot of white noise after 9/11,
countries wanting to help out.

870
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:21,954
We got a million tips,
and you know, things got lost in the shuffle.

871
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,123
Human error.

872
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,377
Anyway, I thought you should know about it.

873
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:39,054
I just want to say, I've heard a lot about you.

874
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:41,640
You inspired me to come to Pakistan.

875
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,643
Maybe you'd let me
buy you a kebab sometime.

876
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:45,811
Don't eat out.

877
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,356
It's too dangerous.

878
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,332
Yeah?

879
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,085
Dan, Debbie found Abu Ahmed.

880
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:12,755
Really?

881
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,091
Yeah. He's been in the files this whole time.
The family's named Sayeed.

882
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,761
Okay, but he's dead,

883
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,888
so doesn't that make him
a little less interesting to you?

884
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:22,139
He may not be.

885
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,683
We now know Abu Ahmed
is one of eight brothers.

886
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:27,936
All the brothers in the family look alike.
Three of them went to Afghanistan.

887
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,773
Isn't it possible that
when the three eldest brothers

888
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,484
grew beards in Afghanistan,
they started to look alike?

889
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:36,820
I think the one calling himself
Abu Ahmed is still alive.

890
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:39,531
The picture we've been using is wrong.

891
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:43,368
It's of his older brother, Habeeb.
He's the one that's dead.

892
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,621
Okay, and what are you basing this on?

893
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,624
We have no intercepts
about Abu Ahmed dying,

894
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,084
we just have a detainee
who said he buried a guy

895
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,377
who looked like Abu Ahmed.

896
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,963
But if someone as important
as Abu Ahmed had died,

897
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,590
they'd be talking about it online

898
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,258
in chat rooms all over the place.

899
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,637
Plus, the detainee said
that Habeeb died in 2001.

900
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:05,766
We know Abu Ahmed was alive then,
trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar.

901
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,560
That means it's probably
one of the other brothers

902
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,312
that's dead.

903
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,483
In other words, you want it to be true.

904
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,527
Yes, I fucking want it to be true!

905
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,655
Calm down.

906
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,490
I am calm.

907
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,326
State your request.

908
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,870
Move heaven and earth,

909
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:32,417
and bring me this fucking
Sayeed family's phone number.

910
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,298
Okay, I'll go and talk to the Wolf.

911
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,789
I need a couple hundred thousand bucks.

912
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,750
Four max.

913
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,880
Where you gonna get that?

914
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,590
From you.

915
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,300
- You think so?
- Yeah.

916
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,551
This could crack open the facilitator

917
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:26,221
Maya's been looking for
by giving us a phone number.

918
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,182
She's your killer, Wolf.
You put her in the field.

919
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,476
Come on.

920
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:39,026
"Allah rewards those that strive and fight
over those that sit behind a desk."

921
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:47,242
As you know, Abu Ghraib
and Gitmo fucked us.

922
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:51,830
The detainee program is now flypaper.
We got senators jumping out of our asses.

923
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,833
And the director is very concerned.

924
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:59,046
They will not stop until they have a body.

925
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,633
I ran it.

926
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,386
I'll defend it.

927
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:10,849
Done.

928
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:35,040
I tell you what, man,
it's good to be back in Kuwait.

929
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,209
And it's good to see you again.

930
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:39,711
It's been a while.

931
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,718
I need a favor.

932
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:49,930
Why I should help you?

933
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,349
Because we're friends.

934
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,184
You saying we are friend.

935
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,937
How come you only call me
when you need help?

936
01:11:57,021 --> 01:12:01,024
But when I need something,
you are too busy to pick up the phone.

937
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:03,151
I don't think we are friend.

938
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,653
All right, fair enough.

939
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,532
How about a V10 Lamborghini?

940
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,534
How's that for friendship?

941
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,328
Poor fucker had to get out of bed.

942
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,291
Hey.

943
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,674
- Thank you very much for this. Appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

944
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:29,219
All right.

945
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:33,265
- Is this a Balboni?
- Yeah.

946
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,768
Fuck me dead.

947
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,103
That's nice.

948
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,522
Really nice. What are you thinking?

949
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,484
Maybe a convertible?
Get a bit of wind in the hair?

950
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:46,945
Put the top down?

951
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,451
I think I will choose this one.

952
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,911
Give us a minute? Thank you.

953
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:56,830
That's a nice choice, my friend.

954
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,708
Speed yellow. Go big or go home, huh?

955
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,293
Nice choice.

956
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:09,676
Sayeed?

957
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,387
Who is it?

958
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:15,223
Who do you think? Guy's a terrorist.

959
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,350
His mother lives here.

960
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:20,020
I just need her phone number.

961
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,816
There will be no repercussions in Kuwait?

962
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,196
Somebody might die,
at some point, in Pakistan.

963
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,992
We got a deal?

964
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:19,788
Hey, Jack.

965
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,582
Sayeed family call in progress,
but you're not gonna like this.

966
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:25,001
The Ground Branch guys
are dragging their heels.

967
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:27,337
- There's no team deployed right now.
- Fuck.

968
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,880
He hasn't said anything incriminating,

969
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,174
but he's at the Rawal Call Center
in Rawalpindi.

970
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:34,553
Hey!

971
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:37,556
Why haven't you deployed a team
to stay in Rawalpindi?

972
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,228
For one thing, it's dangerous.

973
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,522
For another, the area is too congested for us

974
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,941
to be effective without
some predictive intelligence.

975
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,901
Yeah, but that's why
you should forward deploy,

976
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,153
so you can shorten your response time.

977
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:52,362
Still, it wouldn't work.

978
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:53,488
Why?

979
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:57,909
The guy never stays
on the phone long enough.

980
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,703
You haven't tried.

981
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:01,454
Look, I don't have the personnel.

982
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:02,622
That's bullshit, man.

983
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:07,127
Yeah? As it is, my guys don't get any sleep
tracking the threats within Pakistan.

984
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,378
Right, I understand.

985
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:11,840
But, you know, I don't really care
if your guys get sleep or not!

986
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:37,282
This guy you're obsessed with,
what's his name again?

987
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:40,994
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's the nom de guerre.

988
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,872
His true name, we think, is lbrahim Sayeed.

989
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,665
Family lives in Kuwait.

990
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,792
We've been listening in on their calls.

991
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:51,213
Wasn't it, like, eight brothers

992
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:54,883
and a million cousins, that we know about?

993
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,635
Anyone could be calling home.

994
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,969
- I know.
- I mean, it's not like

995
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,138
he's saying,
"Hey, Mom, it's me, the terrorist."

996
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,600
Yeah, I know.

997
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:06,061
But, look, over the course of two months,

998
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,813
he's called from six different pay phones,
from two different cities,

999
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,565
never using the same phone twice.

1000
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,235
And when his mother asked him
where he was, he lied.

1001
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,612
He said that he was in a place in the country

1002
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:18,073
with bad cell reception,
implying he was in the Tribals,

1003
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:20,742
when in fact, he was in a market in Peshawar.

1004
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:24,329
I'm sorry, but that's not normal
guy behavior, that's tradecraft.

1005
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,708
Well, maybe he just doesn't like his mom.

1006
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:38,593
Look, if he talks about an operation
or refers to anything remotely fishy,

1007
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:40,136
I'll get on him, okay?

1008
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,429
No, no. Not okay.

1009
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:44,599
Look, Abu Ahmed is too smart

1010
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:47,477
to tip his hand by
talking about ops on the phone.

1011
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,854
He works for bin Laden.

1012
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,691
The guys that talk about ops
on the phone don't get that job.

1013
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,990
A lot of my friends have died
trying to do this.

1014
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:07,706
I believe I was spared
so I could finish the job.

1015
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:13,146
It is in surveillance video
and pictures like this

1016
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:17,108
of the explosive-laden vehicle
just moments before it was parked

1017
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:21,029
that police hope to find the man
who wanted so badly last night

1018
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,365
to leave a body count in Times Square.

1019
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:27,285
There are some people around the world
that find our freedom so threatening

1020
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:30,163
that they're willing
to kill themselves and others

1021
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:32,540
to prevent us from enjoying it,
but we're not gonna let that...

1022
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:35,877
I really need to talk to you about beefing up
our surveillance operation on the caller.

1023
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,129
We don't have a surveillance operation
on the caller.

1024
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,216
Someone just tried to blow up Times Square,

1025
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,051
and you're talking to me
about some facilitator

1026
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:46,304
who some detainee seven years ago said
might have been working with al-Qaeda?

1027
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:47,680
He's the key to bin Laden.

1028
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,852
I don't fucking care about bin Laden.

1029
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:55,021
I care about the next attack.

1030
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,816
You're gonna start working on
the American al-Qaeda cells.

1031
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,150
Protect the homeland.

1032
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:02,946
bin Laden is the one who keeps telling them
to attack the homeland!

1033
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,280
If it wasn't for him,

1034
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,866
al-Qaeda would still be
focused on overseas targets.

1035
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:10,703
If you really want to protect the homeland,
you need to get bin Laden.

1036
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:13,081
This guy never met bin Laden!

1037
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,584
This guy's a freelancer working
off the fucking Internet.

1038
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,087
No one's even talked to
bin Laden in four years.

1039
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,463
He's out of the game.

1040
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:23,007
He may well even be dead.
He might as well be fucking dead.

1041
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,677
But you know what you're doing?
You're chasing a ghost

1042
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,595
while the whole fucking network
grows all around you!

1043
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,515
You just want me to nail some
low-level Mullah-crack-a-dulla,

1044
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,600
so you can check that box
on your résumé that says

1045
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:35,478
while you were in Pakistan,
you got a real terrorist!

1046
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:38,857
But the truth is,
you don't understand Pakistan!

1047
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,151
And you don't know al-Qaeda!

1048
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,903
Either give me the team
I need to follow this lead,

1049
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:46,114
or the other thing you're gonna
have on your résumé

1050
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:49,701
is being the first station chief to be
called before a Congressional committee

1051
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:54,080
for subverting the efforts
to capture or kill bin Laden!

1052
01:19:58,169 --> 01:20:00,587
You're fucking out of your mind.

1053
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:05,633
I need four techs
in a safe house in Rawalpindi,

1054
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,553
four techs in a safe house in Peshawar.

1055
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,972
Either send them out,
or send me back to D.C.

1056
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,641
and explain to the director why you did it.

1057
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,412
I've been looking for you.

1058
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:37,290
More importantly, he's been looking for you.

1059
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,752
Yesterday, your caller
bought himself a cell phone.

1060
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:46,257
And every time his phone rings,
this phone will ring.

1061
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,053
Did I hook you up?

1062
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:51,387
- Did I?
- Oh, my God!

1063
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,307
I love you!

1064
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:05,902
My guess is that he lives close
to where he's making the calls.

1065
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,238
And it makes sense he'd be living
in Rawalpindi,

1066
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,573
because there's an Al Jazeera office there.

1067
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:14,202
It'd be convenient for him
to drop the tapes off

1068
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:17,789
if he's messengering either from bin Laden
or through an intermediary.

1069
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:22,710
So when he wants to make a call,
he leaves the house, walks a few blocks,

1070
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,712
then switches on the phone.

1071
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:28,299
We need to keep canvassing
the neighborhood until we find him.

1072
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:43,731
We got a shooter.

1073
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:50,989
We're blocked.

1074
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,830
Let me talk to them.

1075
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,784
They said white faces don't belong here.

1076
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:41,080
If they don't move, shoot them.

1077
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:11,736
He still on?

1078
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:14,947
He's east of us. Try the market.

1079
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,157
Okay, heading east.

1080
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:28,461
Fuck.

1081
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:08,000
We got a signal on Tipu Road for 10 minutes.

1082
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,670
Then he went to Umar Road for five minutes.

1083
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:12,714
Nogaza Road.

1084
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,675
Darya Abad, that's in the Umar Road area.

1085
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,053
In Rawalpindi, Haider Road.

1086
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,304
Roomi Road.

1087
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,474
He went to the Convoy Road,
which is near the hospital.

1088
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:26,144
All right? So that's Haider,

1089
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:31,399
Roomi Road, Said, Nogaza, Taimur.

1090
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,276
He made a call from Haifa Street.

1091
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,986
That's the spice district.

1092
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,448
Lahore Street, which is also in Pesh,
30 minutes.

1093
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,826
Wazir Bagh Road, five.

1094
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,121
Nishter Abad, five.

1095
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,500
Phandu Road, five minutes.

1096
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:56,257
The Grand Trunk Road, 45 seconds.

1097
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:01,512
There's no pattern. Sometimes he calls
every two weeks, sometimes every three.

1098
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:02,638
There's no consistency.

1099
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:07,101
I can't predict when he's gonna
make another call 'cause the guy's erratic.

1100
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,574
Right there! Back up!

1101
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:12,166
Meanwhile, our chief foreign correspondent
Richard Engel confirms

1102
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:16,462
the CIA's top spy in Pakistan
has been pulled out of there.

1103
01:26:16,547 --> 01:26:18,714
He's been receiving death threats
after being named

1104
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:24,136
publicly in a lawsuit by the family
of a victim of a US drone attack.

1105
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,973
Richard Engel quotes
a senior intelligence official

1106
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,892
as saying the officer is returning to the U.S.

1107
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:34,230
after the decision was made
the terrorist threats against him, in Pakistan,

1108
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:37,775
were of such a serious nature,
it would not be smart not to act.

1109
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:43,322
ISI fucked you.

1110
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:48,786
I'm so sorry, Joseph.

1111
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,902
Still on tower three.

1112
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,528
Five.

1113
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,071
Signal getting stronger.

1114
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:25,781
Ten. Fifteen.

1115
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,074
Keep going.

1116
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,368
Twenty. Fifteen. Ten.

1117
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,537
Signal's getting weaker.

1118
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,336
We lost him. No signal.

1119
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:42,214
Heading south.

1120
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,433
He's up at five again.

1121
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,602
Fifteen. Twenty.

1122
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:55,937
He's moving fast.

1123
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,438
He's in a vehicle.

1124
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,023
Weaker now. He's shifted.

1125
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:00,733
We're back to five.

1126
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,486
He's close by here somewhere.

1127
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:05,821
I don't get it.

1128
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:10,201
He's driving in circles.

1129
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,712
- No change?
- No.

1130
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:33,683
Now let's hope he comes back around.

1131
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:05,923
Okay.

1132
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:07,174
Fifteen.

1133
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:09,719
Twenty.

1134
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,137
Thirty.

1135
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,139
Forty.

1136
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:14,390
Fifty.

1137
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:16,726
We're within 10 meters of him.

1138
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:25,484
Back to 40.

1139
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:27,778
He's here somewhere.

1140
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,614
Look at the cars. Look at the cars.
He's in a vehicle.

1141
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,581
The guy with the phone in the white car.

1142
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,625
You see him?

1143
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,544
Is that him?

1144
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,546
- Could be.
- You got him?

1145
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,298
- Got him.
- Okay, I'm breaking off.

1146
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:55,222
The guy you've been looking for,
geolocated, on his cell phone

1147
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,683
in his white car.

1148
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,977
Thank you.

1149
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:03,731
If you're right,

1150
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:06,650
the whole world's gonna want in on this.

1151
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,403
So you got to stick to your guns now.

1152
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:21,749
Okay. No, it's great to speak to you, too.
I'm amazed that you're still here.

1153
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,877
No, I can do...

1154
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:26,796
Let me have a look.

1155
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,006
Why don't we say 1:30.

1156
01:30:31,468 --> 01:30:32,885
Yeah.

1157
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:35,346
Can you just hold the line, please?

1158
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,973
I need a picket line along the GT highway

1159
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:40,601
and men spaced at intervals
along the road and at every exit.

1160
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,436
Maya, I know.

1161
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:44,688
So you agree with me now, this is important.

1162
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,275
No, I've just learned from my predecessor

1163
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,362
that life is better
when I don't disagree with you.

1164
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,116
Our current hypothesis is that he lives

1165
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,410
somewhere along the highway,
in one of the towns,

1166
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:43,038
or a medium-sized city called
Abbottabad, or up near Kashmir.

1167
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:48,752
Kashmir's interesting because
it's a way station for the Tribals.

1168
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,380
Abbottabad is interesting because we know

1169
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:55,759
from detainee reporting that Abu Faraj
stayed there briefly in 2003.

1170
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:01,182
The good news is he's driving a white SUV.

1171
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:03,601
SUVs are actually pretty rare in Pakistan.

1172
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:07,980
If he was driving a sedan
or a compact, we'd be fucked.

1173
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:10,649
Obviously, this assumes
he doesn't change vehicles.

1174
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,122
Good morning.

1175
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:26,373
Good morning, Amad.

1176
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,440
Any American in Pakistan is a target.

1177
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:36,026
They don't necessarily know I'm CIA.

1178
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:37,820
Doesn't matter.

1179
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:39,571
You're on a list.

1180
01:33:39,656 --> 01:33:41,115
Yeah.

1181
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:46,954
And you of all people should know that
once you're on their list, you never get off.

1182
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:51,375
Next time, there may not be
bulletproof glass to save you.

1183
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:57,006
We'll keep up on the surveillance
as best we can.

1184
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:34,728
The high-res version.
Can you get closer than that?

1185
01:35:34,813 --> 01:35:36,313
Yeah, we can up-res this image.

1186
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,065
- Even more?
- Yeah, do that.

1187
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,109
- Make a PDF, e-mail it to me, cc George.
- Okay, that's good.

1188
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:41,944
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1189
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,198
I'll take that. Thank you very much.

1190
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,283
- Take that to her.
- You got it.

1191
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:50,494
You could clean that audio as well.
Just take the low end out.

1192
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,344
Hey.

1193
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:11,181
All right. So tell me how I'm doing so far.

1194
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:13,100
Basically, we got a guy
who rolled with al-Qaeda

1195
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,393
and did services for him.

1196
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,811
We lost him for seven years.

1197
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:19,523
Now we find him again, and,
boy, does he have a really nice house.

1198
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:20,691
Is that it?

1199
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,401
Pretty much.

1200
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:25,195
All right, let's go talk to the boss.

1201
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,535
You should sit back there.

1202
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:34,371
- Sorry.
- No.

1203
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:43,964
So, they're gonna ask
if bin Laden is at the end of this rainbow,

1204
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:47,134
is the Pak military with him?

1205
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:49,636
The question isn't,
"Are the Paks protecting bin Laden?"

1206
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,890
The question is, "Would he allow himself
to be protected by the Paks?"

1207
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:55,601
I mean, why would he trust them?
He tried to kill Musharraf.

1208
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:05,903
- Hello.
- Sir.

1209
01:37:08,198 --> 01:37:09,907
All right, go ahead.

1210
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,993
So, a little context here.
If you take a right out of Islamabad,

1211
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:17,080
drive about 45 minutes north,
you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad.

1212
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:20,834
Now, it's a mostly
middle-class community, some ex-military.

1213
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:22,503
Not particularly interesting to us.

1214
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:25,839
Except we did find this compound,
which is unique.

1215
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:29,676
We've got a 16-foot wall
around the entire perimeter.

1216
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:31,178
The windows are blacked out.

1217
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:35,224
There's even a seven-foot privacy wall here,
so even if we got up high,

1218
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:36,725
we couldn't get a vantage point.

1219
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:39,228
I mean, it's a fortress.

1220
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:41,563
Well, can't you put a camera somewhere?

1221
01:37:41,648 --> 01:37:43,273
In these trees here, maybe?

1222
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:44,942
Get a look into the main house?

1223
01:37:45,026 --> 01:37:47,069
lt'd probably be discovered.

1224
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:52,157
Well, we have to get a look
into the house, don't we?

1225
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:58,914
All right.

1226
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:01,792
What's this, this cluster
of buildings down here?

1227
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,961
The PMA. It's the Pakistani Military Academy.

1228
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:08,924
It's their West Point.

1229
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:16,473
And how close is that to the house?

1230
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:18,892
About a mile.

1231
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:20,477
4,221 feet.

1232
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:22,479
It's closer to eight-tenths of a mile.

1233
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,481
Who are you?

1234
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:27,234
I'm the motherfucker
that found this place, sir.

1235
01:38:29,571 --> 01:38:30,988
Really?

1236
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:38,203
All right, I want to know more about who's
inside this house by the end of the week.

1237
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:42,332
Sir.

1238
01:38:51,509 --> 01:38:52,759
"Motherfucker."

1239
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:56,054
Good.

1240
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:14,948
Morning, George!

1241
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:18,452
21 days.

1242
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:20,954
It's been 21 days since we found the house.

1243
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,331
Nothing's happened.

1244
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,409
- Yeah?
- Maya, it's Steve.

1245
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,828
Swing by. I want to show you something.

1246
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:03,121
Okay.

1247
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:05,832
Okay, you can leave it paused for now,
but we're gonna

1248
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,125
- play through that, go straight...
- Hey.

1249
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:09,753
- Maya. Come see.
- Yeah.

1250
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:14,508
- Okay, this is from a few minutes ago, okay?
- Yeah.

1251
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:16,051
So remember, we've got two males,

1252
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:18,428
- two females and seven kids.
- What's that?

1253
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:20,931
Okay, I'm saying that's Bushra,
the brother's wife.

1254
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,724
Well, how do you know the gender?

1255
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:24,768
Well, look, this is a clothesline
right here, for laundry.

1256
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:26,144
Men don't mess with the wash.

1257
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,313
Okay, now, watch.
It takes her about four seconds

1258
01:40:28,398 --> 01:40:30,023
to move from there to the front door,

1259
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:32,901
- so she's on the older side.
- What's that up there?

1260
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:37,531
Those are kids, they're shuffling around,
sword-fighting or something with sticks.

1261
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:40,200
You can see their height relative to this,
these are cows.

1262
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:41,952
So they're probably between seven and nine.

1263
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,788
- Boys, definitely.
- Your female's moving fast.

1264
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:47,874
Okay, that's what I wanted to show you.
Can we pause this, please?

1265
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:49,543
That's not the same lady.

1266
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,294
That's female number three.

1267
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,550
So you found two males, three females.

1268
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:57,968
That's correct.

1269
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:02,806
So if there are three females,
there ought to be three males.

1270
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:05,976
Observing Muslim women
live with their parents

1271
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,270
or with their husbands.

1272
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:11,064
We think there's a third family
living in the house.

1273
01:41:12,275 --> 01:41:15,318
So this third male that you've identified
as possibly being bin Laden,

1274
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:18,238
do I give up all hope
of ever seeing a photograph of him?

1275
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:20,657
Hope? Yeah.

1276
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:23,744
You give up your hope right now.

1277
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:26,413
We scan for heat signatures,

1278
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:30,167
but we can't validate
if it's a man or a woman up there.

1279
01:41:31,169 --> 01:41:35,630
We talked about burrowing a pinhole camera,
but there's a high risk of discovery.

1280
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:39,092
We found a safe house,

1281
01:41:39,177 --> 01:41:43,597
but we can't get a vantage point
to fire a telescope over the balcony wall.

1282
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:47,058
We have explored the possibility
of digging tunnels,

1283
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:49,728
of sending hot air balloons, of rerouting

1284
01:41:49,812 --> 01:41:53,774
supply C-130s to take a peek,
but that might be too alerting.

1285
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:57,652
We've looked for ways of collecting
available DNA from his trash,

1286
01:41:57,737 --> 01:42:00,864
you know, looking for his toothbrush,
but they burn the trash.

1287
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:04,159
We started a vaccination program.

1288
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:07,037
We sent a doctor to the house,
see if he could pull blood.

1289
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:12,751
But that didn't work out.

1290
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:16,296
We thought about sending
a guy with a bucket

1291
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,466
to pull a sample from the sewer to analyze
his fecal matter.

1292
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:21,426
What was wrong with that, exactly?

1293
01:42:21,928 --> 01:42:24,221
What was wrong with that?

1294
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:27,182
The sample would be too diluted.

1295
01:42:27,809 --> 01:42:32,145
And it's asking too much to get a voice
confirmation with him on the phone?

1296
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:34,481
They don't make telephone calls
from the compound.

1297
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:36,566
We pulled the cell tower nearby.

1298
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:41,071
And I'm also gonna give up hope that
he might ever get in that white SUV

1299
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:46,284
and drive around a bit and we could see him.

1300
01:42:46,369 --> 01:42:48,078
Don't they get groceries?

1301
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,997
The unidentified third male
does not get groceries.

1302
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:52,374
He does not leave the compound.

1303
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:54,793
He does not present himself
for photographs.

1304
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:59,756
When he needs fresh air,
he paces around beneath a grape arbor.

1305
01:42:59,841 --> 01:43:03,343
But the leaves are so thick,
they obscure our satellite views.

1306
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:07,931
This is a professional attempt
to avoid detection.

1307
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:09,933
Okay? Real tradecraft.

1308
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:12,936
The only people
we've seen behave in this way

1309
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,938
are other top-level al-Qaeda operatives.

1310
01:43:15,857 --> 01:43:17,941
We did a Red Team on your analysis.

1311
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:22,445
According to them, this behavior could
belong to someone other than al-Qaeda.

1312
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,656
They did give a 40% chance

1313
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:28,702
that the unidentified third man
is a senior al-Qaeda operative.

1314
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:31,538
But they also said there's a 35% chance
he's a Saudi drug dealer,

1315
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:34,416
15% chance he's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler,

1316
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,419
10% chance he's one of
the relatives of the brothers.

1317
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:38,712
Basically, we agree with you.

1318
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:42,090
The house screams security,
it screams someone who wants privacy,

1319
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:45,343
it even screams bad guy,
but it does not scream bin Laden.

1320
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:48,096
You get the point,
if you can't prove it's bin Laden,

1321
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,807
at least prove it's not someone else.

1322
01:43:50,892 --> 01:43:52,601
Like a drug dealer.

1323
01:43:57,273 --> 01:44:01,318
You know we lost the ability to prove that
when we lost the detainee program.

1324
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:03,028
Who the hell am I supposed to ask?

1325
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:09,701
Some guy in Gitmo who's all lawyered up?
He'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden.

1326
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:14,456
You'll think of something.

1327
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:36,770
He'd be the first successful drug dealer
never to have dealt drugs.

1328
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:41,650
He has no Internet access to the house.
He makes no phone calls, either in or out.

1329
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:45,654
Who's he selling to? Who's he buying from?
How's he making his money?

1330
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:49,449
And if you were to say he's retired,
I'd say, where's the swimming pool?

1331
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:52,369
Where's the gold cage with the falcons?

1332
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:56,873
And why does he send his courier
to the two cities in Pakistan

1333
01:44:56,958 --> 01:44:59,209
we most associate with al-Qaeda

1334
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:02,629
that have nothing particularly
to do with heroin production?

1335
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:06,216
The President is a thoughtful, analytical guy.

1336
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,051
He needs proof.

1337
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:21,398
Go ahead, you guys.

1338
01:45:24,443 --> 01:45:26,403
I got to say, yourjob...

1339
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:31,366
I just don't get the rhythms of politics.

1340
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,451
You think this is political?

1341
01:45:33,536 --> 01:45:35,578
If this was political,
we'd be having this conversation

1342
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:38,039
in October when there's an election bump.

1343
01:45:38,124 --> 01:45:43,753
This is pure risk, based on
deductive reasoning, inference, supposition,

1344
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:47,549
and the only human reporting
you have is six years old

1345
01:45:47,633 --> 01:45:49,968
from detainees who were
questioned under duress.

1346
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:52,637
The political move here is
to tell you to go fuck yourself

1347
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:58,101
and remind you that I was in the room
when your old boss pitched WMD Iraq.

1348
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:00,770
At least there
you guys brought photographs.

1349
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:04,816
You know, you're right.
I agree with everything you just said.

1350
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:07,527
What I meant was, a man in your position,

1351
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:12,449
how do you evaluate the risk
of not doing something?

1352
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:18,580
The risk of potentially letting bin Laden
slip through your fingers.

1353
01:46:19,665 --> 01:46:21,750
That is a fascinating question.

1354
01:46:25,755 --> 01:46:26,880
Hey...

1355
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:33,470
I'm not saying we're gonna do it,

1356
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,432
but the President wants to know,
if we were gonna act,

1357
01:46:37,516 --> 01:46:39,726
how would we do it?

1358
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,144
Give us options.

1359
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,722
Technically, these don't exist.

1360
01:47:17,807 --> 01:47:20,934
I actually tried to kill this program
a couple of times.

1361
01:47:21,602 --> 01:47:24,437
They've gone through
an initial round of testing,

1362
01:47:24,522 --> 01:47:27,107
and they have excellent radar defeat.

1363
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:30,110
We just haven't tested them
with people in them yet.

1364
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:31,986
You'll notice the stealth panels,

1365
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:34,572
similar to what we use on the B-2.

1366
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:37,408
The rotors have been muffled
with decibel killers.

1367
01:47:37,493 --> 01:47:40,620
It's slower than a Black Hawk
and lacks the offense and the stability,

1368
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:42,872
but it can hide.

1369
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:46,835
So, excuse me, but what
do we need this for in Libya?

1370
01:47:46,919 --> 01:47:49,712
I mean, Qaddafi's anti-air
is virtually nonexistent.

1371
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:53,049
Maya, do you want to brief him?

1372
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:05,478
There are two narratives about
the location of Usama bin Laden.

1373
01:48:05,563 --> 01:48:07,188
The one that you're most familiar with

1374
01:48:07,273 --> 01:48:10,316
is that UBL is hiding in
a cave in the Tribal Areas,

1375
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:13,444
that he's surrounded by a large
contingent of loyal fighters.

1376
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:17,699
But that narrative is
pre-9/11 understanding of UBL.

1377
01:48:17,783 --> 01:48:21,578
The second narrative
is that he's living in a city.

1378
01:48:21,662 --> 01:48:25,165
Living in a city with multiple points
of egress and entry,

1379
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:27,834
access to communications,

1380
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:31,087
so that he can keep in touch
with the organization.

1381
01:48:31,172 --> 01:48:34,549
You can't run a global network
of interconnected cells from a cave.

1382
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:37,051
We've located an individual we believe,

1383
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:41,222
based on detainee reporting,
is bin Laden's courier.

1384
01:48:41,307 --> 01:48:44,267
He's living in a house
in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

1385
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:46,769
And we assess

1386
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:51,191
that one of the other occupants of the house

1387
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:52,609
is UBL.

1388
01:49:04,246 --> 01:49:05,747
General.

1389
01:49:13,047 --> 01:49:14,214
Excuse me.

1390
01:49:16,133 --> 01:49:19,010
So, UBL,
you got an intel source on the ground?

1391
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:23,181
- No.
- No?

1392
01:49:24,642 --> 01:49:26,809
Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden?

1393
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:30,313
'Cause the truth is
we've been on this op before, it was '07,

1394
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:33,066
and it wasn't bin Laden,
and we lost a couple of guys.

1395
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:37,237
Totally understand. bin Laden uses a courier
to interact with the outside world.

1396
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:39,739
By locating the courier,
we've located bin Laden.

1397
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:41,991
That's really the intel?

1398
01:49:42,076 --> 01:49:43,826
That's it?

1399
01:49:43,911 --> 01:49:45,912
Quite frankly,
I didn't even want to use you guys,

1400
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:48,164
with your dip and your Velcro
and all your gear bullshit.

1401
01:49:48,249 --> 01:49:49,707
I wanted to drop a bomb.

1402
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:52,502
But people didn't believe
in this lead enough to drop a bomb.

1403
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:55,421
So they're using you guys as canaries,

1404
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:57,757
in the theory that if bin Laden isn't there,

1405
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,635
you can sneak away,
and no one will be the wiser.

1406
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:04,347
But bin Laden is there.

1407
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:07,725
And you're gonna kill him for me.

1408
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:15,525
They're nervous downtown.

1409
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:18,569
I don't think we'll get
an approval this decision cycle.

1410
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:33,835
It's her against the world.

1411
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:35,878
Yeah.

1412
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:41,509
I'm about to go look the President in the eye,

1413
01:50:41,593 --> 01:50:45,388
and what I'd like to know,
no fucking bullshit,

1414
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:48,474
is where everyone stands on this thing.

1415
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:53,479
Now, very simply,
is he there or is he not fucking there?

1416
01:50:55,024 --> 01:50:58,151
We all come at this through the filter
of our own past experiences.

1417
01:50:58,235 --> 01:51:01,863
Now, I remember Iraq WMD very clearly.
I fronted that.

1418
01:51:01,947 --> 01:51:05,533
And I can tell you the case for that
was much stronger than this case.

1419
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:07,368
A fuckin' yes or a no.

1420
01:51:07,453 --> 01:51:09,996
We don't deal in certainty,
we deal in probability,

1421
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,750
and I'd say there's a 60%
probability he's there.

1422
01:51:16,754 --> 01:51:19,922
I concur, 60%.

1423
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:23,926
I'm at 80%.
Their OPSEC is what convinces me.

1424
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,181
You guys ever agree on anything?

1425
01:51:28,265 --> 01:51:30,099
Well, I agree with Mike.

1426
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:32,310
We're basing this mostly
on detainee reporting,

1427
01:51:32,394 --> 01:51:34,437
and I spent a bunch of time in those rooms.

1428
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:37,482
I'd say it's a soft 60, sir.

1429
01:51:37,566 --> 01:51:39,942
I'm virtually certain
there's some high-value target there.

1430
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:42,445
I'm just not sure it's bin Laden.

1431
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:46,741
Well, this is a little bit
of a clusterfuck, isn't it?

1432
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:49,869
I'd like to know what Maya thinks.

1433
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:51,996
We're all incorporating
her assessment into ours.

1434
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:53,623
100% he's there.

1435
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:59,212
Okay, fine, 95%,
'cause I know certainty freaks you guys out.

1436
01:51:59,296 --> 01:52:01,339
But it's 100.

1437
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:17,397
They're all cowed.

1438
01:52:20,484 --> 01:52:21,943
What do you think of the girl?

1439
01:52:22,027 --> 01:52:24,570
I think she's fucking smart.

1440
01:52:24,655 --> 01:52:26,364
We're all smart, Jeremy.

1441
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:35,790
May I join you?

1442
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:42,046
How is the food down here anyway?

1443
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:44,006
It's okay.

1444
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,968
How long have you worked for the CIA?

1445
01:52:47,052 --> 01:52:50,221
Twelve years.
I was recruited out of high school.

1446
01:52:50,305 --> 01:52:51,889
And do you know why we did that?

1447
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:54,809
I don't think I can answer that question, sir.

1448
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:57,937
I don't think I'm allowed to answer.

1449
01:52:58,522 --> 01:52:59,939
All right.

1450
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:03,443
What else have you done for us?

1451
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:05,403
Besides bin Laden.

1452
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:07,697
Nothing.

1453
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:10,867
I've done nothing else.

1454
01:53:13,495 --> 01:53:15,580
Well, you certainly have a flair for it.

1455
01:53:44,485 --> 01:53:47,153
No. Yeah.

1456
01:53:47,821 --> 01:53:49,655
All right, let's be serious, now.

1457
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,491
Don't fuck around on this one, dude.

1458
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:53,493
You're just fucking around
'cause I'm up by two games.

1459
01:53:54,161 --> 01:53:55,620
How many you got?

1460
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:07,381
So, Patrick, be honest with me.

1461
01:54:07,466 --> 01:54:09,133
You really believe this story?

1462
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:13,262
I mean, no offense. No offense, I know.

1463
01:54:13,347 --> 01:54:16,641
But Usama bin Laden?

1464
01:54:17,768 --> 01:54:18,851
Yeah.

1465
01:54:18,936 --> 01:54:21,145
What part convinced you?

1466
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:23,439
Her confidence.

1467
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:28,027
That's the kind of concrete data point
I'm looking for.

1468
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:31,239
I tell you, buddy, her confidence
is the one thing that's keeping me

1469
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:34,242
from getting ass-raped in a Pakistani prison.
I'm gonna be honest with you, bro.

1470
01:54:36,537 --> 01:54:37,745
I'm cool with it.

1471
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:46,462
Yeah?

1472
01:54:46,547 --> 01:54:49,590
Maya, I wanted you to hear it first.

1473
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:51,759
You know that thing we talked about?

1474
01:54:51,843 --> 01:54:53,886
- It's gonna happen.
- When?

1475
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:55,555
Tonight.

1476
01:54:57,057 --> 01:54:58,266
Good luck.

1477
01:54:58,350 --> 01:54:59,892
- 50 bucks?
- 50 bucks.

1478
01:54:59,977 --> 01:55:01,602
- 50 bucks!
- 50 bucks.

1479
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:04,438
50 bucks.

1480
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:09,443
Lucky shot.

1481
01:55:13,991 --> 01:55:15,366
Go.

1482
01:56:39,117 --> 01:56:41,827
Apache One, you are clear.

1483
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:55,758
Copy.

1484
01:56:56,259 --> 01:56:57,426
Copy that.

1485
01:58:45,202 --> 01:58:47,244
Thirty seconds to first turn.

1486
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:51,373
Hey, Justin, what are you listening to?

1487
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:53,709
Tony Robbins.

1488
01:58:53,794 --> 01:58:55,211
Tony Robbins, really?

1489
01:58:55,504 --> 01:58:59,590
You should listen to it.
I got plans for after this, big-time.

1490
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:00,925
I want to talk to all of you about it.

1491
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:25,241
Who here has been in a helo crash before?

1492
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:30,663
Okay, so we're all good.

1493
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:49,306
We just crossed the border.
Now entering Pakistan.

1494
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:50,766
Pakistani comms, no chatter.

1495
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:18,002
Three minutes. Stand by for doors open.

1496
02:00:33,101 --> 02:00:34,143
Two minutes.

1497
02:01:11,097 --> 02:01:13,849
Should be coming up just off our nose,
11 o'clock.

1498
02:01:21,733 --> 02:01:22,900
Eyes on target.

1499
02:01:27,739 --> 02:01:29,365
Stay tight.

1500
02:01:33,244 --> 02:01:34,328
Thirty seconds.

1501
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:43,522
Hey! Slide right, slide right!

1502
02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:45,607
- Too much updraft off these walls!
- Hey!

1503
02:02:49,654 --> 02:02:51,655
We've lost power. Go to lockout.

1504
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:00,664
Hey!

1505
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:02,791
Hard landing.

1506
02:03:04,294 --> 02:03:05,294
Fuck!

1507
02:03:19,976 --> 02:03:22,978
Prince five-one is down.
Prince five-one is down.

1508
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:26,398
Black Hawk down in the animal pen.

1509
02:03:39,871 --> 02:03:41,497
This way!

1510
02:03:47,504 --> 02:03:50,297
This mission is still a go.
I repeat, we are a go.

1511
02:03:50,381 --> 02:03:53,717
Alpha team is in the animal pen,
making entry for AC-1.

1512
02:03:59,808 --> 02:04:01,433
No ropes. Wheels down.

1513
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:45,477
Prayer room's clear.

1514
02:05:16,259 --> 02:05:17,676
Breacher!

1515
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:44,661
Echo team is away.
Prince five-two exiting Alpha Oscar.

1516
02:05:52,795 --> 02:05:56,965
Three, two, one. Execute!

1517
02:07:08,037 --> 02:07:09,037
lbrahim!

1518
02:07:10,915 --> 02:07:12,207
Come on out!

1519
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:29,433
- Get down!
- Down, down, down, down!

1520
02:07:29,726 --> 02:07:31,518
Down! Throw your hands in the air!

1521
02:07:31,811 --> 02:07:33,603
Down, down, down, down! Down!

1522
02:07:34,314 --> 02:07:36,189
You've killed him.

1523
02:07:36,566 --> 02:07:38,608
All right, go, I got her.

1524
02:08:05,178 --> 02:08:06,428
Down, sit down.

1525
02:08:46,594 --> 02:08:48,053
Echo 11 on perimeter.

1526
02:08:48,137 --> 02:08:50,138
Ready to breach at P-2.

1527
02:08:55,978 --> 02:08:57,479
Fire in the hole.

1528
02:09:01,984 --> 02:09:04,319
Failed breach, failed breach.

1529
02:09:05,238 --> 02:09:07,697
Back it up! Back it up! Main gate!

1530
02:09:19,794 --> 02:09:21,670
We got an unlocked door.

1531
02:09:33,891 --> 02:09:42,065
Abrar.

1532
02:10:19,896 --> 02:10:22,647
It's okay. It's okay.

1533
02:10:23,774 --> 02:10:24,816
This is Echo 11.

1534
02:10:24,901 --> 02:10:26,401
We're going to breach the main gate.

1535
02:10:26,486 --> 02:10:27,861
Negative. This is Echo 01.

1536
02:10:27,945 --> 02:10:29,613
I'm internal, in the corridor.

1537
02:10:29,864 --> 02:10:30,989
I'll let you guys in.

1538
02:10:31,073 --> 02:10:32,115
Roger that.

1539
02:11:12,406 --> 02:11:14,282
Shut that fucking kid up, please.

1540
02:11:19,789 --> 02:11:20,997
Talk to me.

1541
02:11:21,499 --> 02:11:23,124
No fucking way we can blow this thing.

1542
02:11:23,209 --> 02:11:25,335
God fucking damn it,
can you pop it manually?

1543
02:11:26,128 --> 02:11:27,128
No.

1544
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:29,214
Alpha 3, this is Echo 11.

1545
02:11:29,507 --> 02:11:31,424
We're at our primary set point,
prepping to breach.

1546
02:11:32,093 --> 02:11:34,678
Wait one. We're internal on the south side.

1547
02:11:35,137 --> 02:11:36,471
This is a negative breach.

1548
02:11:36,556 --> 02:11:39,099
Roger. Ready to make our entry out here.

1549
02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:40,725
Yeah, roger that. We're coming to meet you.

1550
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:43,436
Stay with these kids
and don't let 'em in that back room.

1551
02:12:02,498 --> 02:12:03,665
- Good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1552
02:12:04,417 --> 02:12:05,584
Yeah.

1553
02:12:05,668 --> 02:12:08,420
I forgot, were we supposed
to crash that helo?

1554
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:10,922
lbrahim tried to shoot through the door.

1555
02:12:11,007 --> 02:12:12,632
- Yeah?
- I popped him from outside.

1556
02:12:13,634 --> 02:12:16,219
I fucking smoked Abrar and his wife.

1557
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:18,972
She still alive?

1558
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:20,849
She's gonna bleed out.

1559
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:22,851
- What a fucking mess.
- Yeah.

1560
02:12:26,772 --> 02:12:28,398
Go, go, go.

1561
02:12:50,963 --> 02:12:52,422
This is Echo 09.

1562
02:12:52,506 --> 02:12:55,675
We have unknowns gathering
on the southwest rooftops.

1563
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:07,395
Locked gate blocking the stairs.

1564
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:09,272
Breacher up.

1565
02:13:16,072 --> 02:13:17,572
Back it up, back up.

1566
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,170
Hey, back it up.

1567
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:34,631
Watch out.

1568
02:13:36,092 --> 02:13:37,175
Execute.

1569
02:13:40,054 --> 02:13:43,098
- Go, go.
- This is Echo 05 moving to level two.

1570
02:13:56,445 --> 02:13:57,612
Hakim, get those guys back.

1571
02:14:18,759 --> 02:14:22,804
Khalid.

1572
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:29,894
Echo 02 moving to deck three.

1573
02:14:48,998 --> 02:14:50,665
Clear.

1574
02:15:06,348 --> 02:15:08,141
Hakim, get 'em back or I'll start smoking 'em.

1575
02:15:08,225 --> 02:15:09,601
Wait, wait, wait.

1576
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:21,112
Go back, they will kill you!

1577
02:15:22,823 --> 02:15:24,741
They will kill you!

1578
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:28,620
Go back!

1579
02:15:29,497 --> 02:15:30,955
Come here!

1580
02:15:35,044 --> 02:15:36,252
No vest.

1581
02:15:36,337 --> 02:15:37,712
All clear.

1582
02:15:41,467 --> 02:15:43,176
Oh, fucking shit.

1583
02:15:55,356 --> 02:16:12,747
Usama.

1584
02:16:19,213 --> 02:16:20,505
Down.

1585
02:16:20,589 --> 02:16:21,589
All right, get him.

1586
02:16:38,023 --> 02:16:39,357
Got a possible jackpot.

1587
02:16:39,441 --> 02:16:40,900
Roger that. Possible jackpot.

1588
02:16:40,985 --> 02:16:42,110
Shoot.

1589
02:16:43,988 --> 02:16:46,531
It's okay, it's okay.

1590
02:16:48,242 --> 02:16:50,535
- Come on.
- Get down.

1591
02:16:53,497 --> 02:16:55,123
- Dude.
- It's okay.

1592
02:16:55,708 --> 02:16:57,292
Do you even realize what you just did?

1593
02:17:01,297 --> 02:17:02,255
Who is he?

1594
02:17:02,339 --> 02:17:03,923
Hey, hey, hey!

1595
02:17:04,008 --> 02:17:05,049
Who is he?

1596
02:17:05,134 --> 02:17:06,134
He is al Noori Hasan.

1597
02:17:07,636 --> 02:17:09,137
Yo, she says it's not him.

1598
02:17:09,221 --> 02:17:10,305
Talk to the kid.

1599
02:17:13,726 --> 02:17:14,976
It's okay.

1600
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:25,528
Daughter, what is his name?

1601
02:17:34,997 --> 02:17:36,664
Name, name.

1602
02:17:39,793 --> 02:17:41,294
- We need them down.
- All right.

1603
02:17:54,016 --> 02:17:56,601
Okay, come on, come on. Come on.

1604
02:18:04,401 --> 02:18:05,777
This is Red 02.

1605
02:18:07,446 --> 02:18:08,571
Geronimo.

1606
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:13,368
For God and country.

1607
02:18:14,078 --> 02:18:15,536
Geronimo.

1608
02:18:23,045 --> 02:18:25,380
All stations, target secure, target secure.

1609
02:18:25,464 --> 02:18:27,131
Roger. Copy that. Target secure.

1610
02:18:27,216 --> 02:18:29,217
Target secure. Commence SSE.

1611
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:33,054
Proper SSE right now.

1612
02:18:33,639 --> 02:18:35,264
Books, DVDs, CDs.

1613
02:18:38,477 --> 02:18:41,312
Every fuckin' hard drive.
Do not leave a hard drive.

1614
02:18:41,397 --> 02:18:43,106
Hey, open that for me.

1615
02:18:44,733 --> 02:18:46,401
Let's go, guys.

1616
02:18:49,238 --> 02:18:50,279
Yo, what's up?

1617
02:18:53,117 --> 02:18:55,201
I shot the third-floor guy.

1618
02:18:58,539 --> 02:19:00,248
Why don't you get to work? Grab a bag.

1619
02:19:00,749 --> 02:19:03,251
QRF is inbound, eight miles out.

1620
02:19:08,048 --> 02:19:09,424
Pak Air Force is responding.

1621
02:19:11,844 --> 02:19:13,302
Fourteen minutes to intercept.

1622
02:19:18,434 --> 02:19:21,519
Any station, this is Red 02.
We need a body bag.

1623
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:26,274
This is Echo 09. Stand by.

1624
02:19:26,608 --> 02:19:28,443
Hakim, I got this. Get it to them.

1625
02:19:34,575 --> 02:19:36,034
Let's go, buddy.

1626
02:19:38,537 --> 02:19:42,248
Echo 05, this is Red 02.
How long do you need for SSE?

1627
02:19:42,332 --> 02:19:44,333
We're gonna need at least 10 minutes, sir.

1628
02:19:44,418 --> 02:19:46,878
Echo 05, you have four mikes.

1629
02:19:47,463 --> 02:19:49,380
This is a gold mine.
I need more time than that.

1630
02:19:49,465 --> 02:19:53,718
Echo 05, if you're not at the L.Z. at
four mikes, I'm gonna leave your ass behind.

1631
02:19:53,802 --> 02:19:56,471
The Paks have scrambled the F-16s.

1632
02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:58,806
Four minutes!

1633
02:20:14,031 --> 02:20:16,115
Prince five-two, inbound for L.Z.

1634
02:20:38,514 --> 02:20:40,056
Where do you need the bag?

1635
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:41,307
Third deck.

1636
02:20:58,659 --> 02:21:00,368
- Here!
- Here.

1637
02:21:15,676 --> 02:21:16,676
And up.

1638
02:21:22,558 --> 02:21:24,142
All right, let's move it out.

1639
02:21:35,571 --> 02:21:37,363
Let's go! Now!

1640
02:22:01,096 --> 02:22:03,514
You've got one mike
to blow that downed helo.

1641
02:22:40,469 --> 02:22:42,428
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1642
02:23:08,538 --> 02:23:11,666
QRF-46 inbound for L.Z., 30 seconds out.

1643
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:15,795
Chopper 4-6, we are demoing 5-1.

1644
02:23:15,879 --> 02:23:18,256
Chopper 4-6, wave off.

1645
02:23:19,007 --> 02:23:20,675
4-6, wave off! Wave off!

1646
02:25:27,010 --> 02:25:28,135
Up!

1647
02:25:39,314 --> 02:25:40,356
Well done, Patrick.

1648
02:25:41,274 --> 02:25:42,858
Thank you.

1649
02:25:42,943 --> 02:25:44,568
- Move him through!
- All right, listen up, gentlemen,

1650
02:25:44,653 --> 02:25:45,653
read the signs.

1651
02:25:45,737 --> 02:25:48,906
First floor, hard drives, files, anything!

1652
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:51,659
Second floor, opposite, down on the right!

1653
02:25:52,994 --> 02:25:55,162
Third floor, ladies' underwear.

1654
02:25:56,289 --> 02:25:57,915
That's right, there can't be
that many of 'em, right?

1655
02:25:57,999 --> 02:25:59,834
- And mark all media!
- CDs, DVDs.

1656
02:25:59,918 --> 02:26:01,419
- Who's got a Sharpie?
- CDs.

1657
02:26:01,503 --> 02:26:02,503
CDs.

1658
02:26:04,214 --> 02:26:06,674
- Right here.
- Good job, man.

1659
02:26:07,134 --> 02:26:08,676
- This all right?
- Move it along, bring it in.

1660
02:26:18,270 --> 02:26:19,895
- Nice job.
- All right, all media, CDs, DVDs.

1661
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:21,230
- I want 'em!
- That's all second floor right there.

1662
02:26:21,356 --> 02:26:23,190
Who's logging on this table?

1663
02:26:23,275 --> 02:26:24,817
Where do the hard drives go?

1664
02:26:24,901 --> 02:26:27,069
- Mark on tables.
- Yes, sir.

1665
02:26:27,154 --> 02:26:29,613
You got Ziploc bags and Sharpies, use 'em.

1666
02:26:31,324 --> 02:26:33,409
No, mark all media.

1667
02:26:33,535 --> 02:26:34,743
Good job.

1668
02:26:34,828 --> 02:26:36,287
Gentlemen, watch your backs.

1669
02:26:36,371 --> 02:26:38,622
Slow down!

1670
02:26:38,707 --> 02:26:39,874
Thank you, sir.

1671
02:26:39,958 --> 02:26:41,625
- Good job.
- Slow down.

1672
02:26:41,710 --> 02:26:44,336
- Video cameras?
- Video cameras, where was it found?

1673
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:51,260
Second floor!

1674
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:52,720
All right.

1675
02:26:52,804 --> 02:26:55,097
Yes, sir. One moment, please.

1676
02:27:08,737 --> 02:27:09,904
One moment, please.

1677
02:27:39,059 --> 02:27:42,520
Sir, the Agency expert
gave visual confirmation.

1678
02:27:42,604 --> 02:27:44,813
Yes, sir, the girl, 100%.

1679
02:27:44,898 --> 02:27:46,440
Thank you, sir.

1680
02:28:42,539 --> 02:28:43,622
Are you Maya?

1681
02:28:44,082 --> 02:28:45,249
Yeah.

1682
02:28:45,333 --> 02:28:46,834
That's the only name they gave me.

1683
02:28:46,918 --> 02:28:48,002
You can sit wherever you want.

1684
02:28:48,086 --> 02:28:49,587
You're the only one on the manifest.

1685
02:28:53,383 --> 02:28:55,926
You must be pretty important.

1686
02:28:56,011 --> 02:28:58,846
You got the whole plane to yourself.

1687
02:28:58,930 --> 02:29:00,931
Where do you want to go?
