1
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:29,103
- I can't believe this.
- Why not?

2
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:32,112
Because I love you, Fabio, like a son.

3
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:35,530
And I love you, Don Luis, like a father.

4
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,683
I'm going to miss you.

5
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:43,034
And I'm going to miss you.

6
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:45,147
Okay,

7
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:47,035
enough of this sentimental bullshit.

8
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:51,554
One last drink?
Next, we'll be crying like two old women!

9
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,289
Come on.

10
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:56,072
To the future.

11
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:59,710
<i>Good health and life!</i>

12
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:08,156
So, business is all clear?

13
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,680
It's all here.

14
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,394
- No other copies?
- You have to ask? -Hey!

15
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:22,089
Come on.

16
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:29,791
I'm going to miss you.

17
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:32,082
<i>Bye, Marco.</i>

18
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:42,876
Kill this motherfucker.

19
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,322
<i>I cannot believe this.</i>

20
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,567
Not okay, boss?

21
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:59,653
The bastard thinks I'm an idiot,
playing it all mellow and shit.

22
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:02,126
If he would have yelled and screamed
and threatened to kill my whole family...

23
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:03,758
it would've been better.

24
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,214
<i>We have about an hour to get
outta here at the most! Let's go!</i>

25
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:43,199
We've got ten minutes.

26
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:47,639
- Cataleya, go pack.
- I'm packed Mamma.

27
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:00,291
Cataleya.

28
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:04,848
<i>Listen to me.
In case anything happens...</i>

29
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:08,297
this is your passport.

30
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:12,229
If you find yourself alone,
you go to this address on this card.

31
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,093
Show it to the man at the gate.

32
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:19,910
- I don't understand, Papa.
- You don't have to understand.

33
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:23,716
You just have to listen
and remember.

34
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:30,222
Take the bus and go here.

35
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:38,878
And this... this will keep you safe.

36
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:43,427
The cataleya orchid.
My mother, your grandmother...

37
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:49,889
used to grow them. Every morning I'd wake
up to the sight of them. The smell of them.

38
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:54,126
That's why I named you 'Cataleya'.

39
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:57,168
Never forget where you came from.

40
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:15,305
Hi. We want to see Don Fabio.

41
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,391
He's not home.

42
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:22,644
<i>- I'm ready.
- It's time! Come! Come!</i>

43
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:25,738
- Let's go!
- Come on.

44
00:06:32,628 --> 00:06:34,521
Back, back, back.

45
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:42,327
They say he is not home yet.

46
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:43,946
Wait a minute.

47
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:48,083
It's too late.
Get ready.

48
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:57,604
I love you very much.

49
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:01,684
I love you too, Papa.

50
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,856
Do it now.

51
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,616
Change of plans.

52
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,259
Do you remember me, Cataleya?

53
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,807
I was at your confirmation.

54
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:57,755
My name is Marco
and I was a very good friend of your father.

55
00:08:58,366 --> 00:09:03,021
You know who Don Luis is, right?

56
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:06,217
He was like a father to your father.

57
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:09,089
That makes you family too.

58
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,958
But... when... someone...
is good to you...

59
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:21,884
and you're not good to them back,
then bad things happen.

60
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,439
You do very well in school,

61
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,988
so I know this is not too complicated
for you to understand. Am I Right?

62
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:31,682
Excellent.

63
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:38,419
Now, your father had something that belonged
to Don Luis. It's a small thing.

64
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,448
Not bigger than this.

65
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,823
Do you know where it is?

66
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,634
Well,

67
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:51,859
if you give it to me, Don Luis will be
very happy and very grateful.

68
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:58,712
So... why don't you just give me that
little thing, which belongs to him.

69
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:01,355
Would you do that?

70
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,707
You're a smart girl.

71
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:09,887
And in this life smart girls
always get what they want.

72
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,921
Just tell me, sweetheart...

73
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,992
What do you want?

74
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:22,062
To kill Don Luis!

75
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,068
Grab that little bitch.

76
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:40,041
We need her alive.

77
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:56,647
Find her! Find the little bitch.

78
00:12:48,553 --> 00:12:50,905
Do not stop.

79
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:55,927
Got you.

80
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,501
Excuse me.

81
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:09,097
And you said you...
you have something for us, sweetie?

82
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,851
Well, may I see it?

83
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,548
Okay, everybody,
take a five-minute coffee break.

84
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,377
Jim, we're gonna have to record this.

85
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:09,082
- Where did you get this?
- My Papa.

86
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:11,103
where is your Papa?

87
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,140
Dead.

88
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,636
Do you know what this is?

89
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,428
Yes.

90
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:20,047
My passport.

91
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:28,472
We're about to arrive in Miami.

92
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:31,413
I'll buckle you up.

93
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:48,287
Welcome to America.

94
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,754
Go ahead, I'll wait right here.

95
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:31,485
Hello, young lady, where are we wanting
to go today?

96
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:37,527
Chicago? That's not just down the street,
you know?

97
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,274
How much?

98
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:35,841
Hey, kid, what are you doing here?

99
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:00,736
Emilio.

100
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,692
There's a girl looking for you.

101
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:13,734
It does not matter.

102
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:19,586
Her name is Cataleya.

103
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:48,536
- Cataleya...
- Tio?

104
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:21,398
I thought you were dead.

105
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,343
You're safe.

106
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,983
It's okay.
You're safe now.

107
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,322
You're safe.

108
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:22,037
You have your mother's beautiful eyes.

109
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:25,537
Don't be afraid.

110
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:28,640
This is your home.

111
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:37,423
How long has it been since you sleep?

112
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:40,467
I don't know. A long time ago.

113
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:43,430
Well, good.
A young body needs to sleep.

114
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:46,975
When I was your age,
I would sleep half the day.

115
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,329
I don't know if it helps
with your growing pattern,

116
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,207
but I was always ready
for what came after.

117
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:59,505
Whose room did I sleep in?

118
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:03,032
My son.

119
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,387
Your cousin.

120
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:08,318
Where is he?

121
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:12,673
He's dead.

122
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,107
Killed?

123
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,349
Yes.

124
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:22,691
By whom?

125
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:26,395
No one who is still alive.

126
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,645
You are very talented.

127
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:36,692
- Is this what you want to be, an artist?
- I used to want to be like Xena.

128
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:39,320
A Warrior Princess.

129
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,064
Not any more?

130
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:46,531
No?

131
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:50,891
I want to be a killer.

132
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:56,309
Can you help?

133
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,479
Sure.

134
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:20,410
Normally we don't accept students
in the middle of the academic year.

135
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:27,320
But under these circumstances,
losing her parents in a tragic car accident.

136
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:31,252
Here you are. These are...
the school supplies you'll need.

137
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:32,499
Sorry...

138
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,458
She's a little traumatized.

139
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,810
Of course.

140
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:38,119
See you Monday, Cataleya.

141
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,887
Such a pretty name.

142
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,420
Thanks.

143
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:51,297
After we get all this stuff,
we go over to Maxwell Street...

144
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:54,176
to get hot dogs
from those Polish people here.

145
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:55,519
You like hot dog?

146
00:22:59,684 --> 00:23:01,445
What is it now?

147
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,138
That school has nothing to teach me.

148
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:06,899
I told you what I want.

149
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,616
You don't want to help me? Fine.

150
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:13,119
I'll do it myself.

151
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,536
Look.

152
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,187
See that?
Is that what you want?

153
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:35,408
You want me to teach you how to be
a killer? Sure, no problema, I'll teach you.

154
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,712
But you'll be dead in five years.

155
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:45,556
If you want to be a killer and survive,
you got to be a smart one.

156
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:48,917
You have to know things besides
how to pull a trigger.

157
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:51,057
You have to know how the world works,
how people think...

158
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:53,153
You gotta learn how to stand,
how to be psychological.

159
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:56,606
And I cannot teach you that
unless you learn the basics out of school.

160
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:59,240
You got that? Hmm?

161
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:02,453
Come on. What's it going to be?
Cataleya? You choose.

162
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:04,465
Come on.

163
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:07,381
Now. Choose.

164
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:11,058
What you want? Choose.

165
00:24:19,181 --> 00:24:21,635
Better.

166
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,584
Hey, buddy.
I got the good stuff.

167
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:50,001
- So, might I suggest...
- Yeah?

168
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,616
Let's buy some things.
You know,

169
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:54,223
spice it up a bit,
like we talked about.

170
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:55,128
Some of those stockings...

171
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,945
- that come up to the thigh.
- Right, nice.

172
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:58,953
It's been fourteen years,
you know what I mean?

173
00:24:58,954 --> 00:25:00,807
No matter how much you like steak...

174
00:25:00,808 --> 00:25:03,423
sometimes a lamb chop
isn't a bad thing, right?

175
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:05,102
Exactly.

176
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,999
Son of a bitch!

177
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:27,404
- Put your hands on the car!
- Hands on the vehicle, right now!

178
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,784
Oooh, back...

179
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,631
- Stupid, crazy bitch.
- I'm really sorry.

180
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:37,413
This is not...
it's not even my car.

181
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:40,425
- You think this is funny?
- No, sir!

182
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,971
I'm gonna give you something to laugh about.

183
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:48,746
I'm sorry, officer.
I'm sorry, I don't drink...

184
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,752
There's nothing here.

185
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:17,463
No license, no registration, No ID...

186
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:20,759
except for a library card.

187
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,146
Miss Valerie Philips.

188
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:26,872
In addition to all that,
you are being charged with,

189
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:30,805
D.U.I. driving on the wrong side
of the road and...

190
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,806
the destruction of police property.

191
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,720
Miss Philips!

192
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:38,890
Do I have your full attention?

193
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:44,258
Yeah...
That's it?

194
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:47,984
Unless there's anything else
you can think of?

195
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:52,612
- I have to throw up.
- Oh, no, no, no. Get her out of here.

196
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,963
And a cup of coffee too.
We can book her tomorrow.

197
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:59,465
Let her sleep it off,
for Christ's sake...

198
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:10,450
Alright, big step. Down you come.

199
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:14,355
Alright, stretch those legs. Come on, move!

200
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,456
McGee just checked downstairs.

201
00:27:18,457 --> 00:27:20,671
She's from Rome, okay?
And she says to the other...

202
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,488
Excuse me. U.S. Marshall Warren.

203
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:24,840
We're here with Gennaro Rizzo
on an overnight.

204
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:26,760
Wait, wait, wait...
hold on a second.

205
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:29,615
You know, it says here that
you're not expected until tomorrow.

206
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,813
Yeah, well, never expect
the expected, sergeant.

207
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:33,251
Is that coffee there?
Is that fresh?

208
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,134
- Yes, it is.
- Do you mind?

209
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:36,238
My treat.

210
00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:37,889
- Appreciate it.
- You know, uh...

211
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,517
Officer Doyle is gonna show you
where the cell blocks are.

212
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:41,987
Oh, come on.

213
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:45,049
Home, sweet home.

214
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:51,918
After you, sir.

215
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:02,027
I'm going to miss you, Rizzo.

216
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:05,731
I gonna leave that just there,
just in case you get hungry in the night.

217
00:28:07,114 --> 00:28:08,902
Sleep well.

218
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:12,712
This'll be a caffeine kinda night, Joe.
Keep your eyes open.

219
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,703
Two...

220
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:48,987
Three...

221
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:53,611
Not again.

222
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,409
Hey, Doyle, go check
on the ventilation system, will you?

223
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:58,904
As in today, please?

224
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,254
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I gotta pee...?

225
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:04,649
- Unbutton your shirt... Now.
- What?

226
00:33:08,395 --> 00:33:10,980
Who are you?

227
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:19,145
Go! Come on!

228
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:21,730
We have a security threat.

229
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,862
Come!

230
00:33:25,415 --> 00:33:28,226
Get inside.
Somebody open the fucking door!

231
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:38,339
Look at me, Joe, look at me.
Give me the gun.

232
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,099
Just give it to me, OK. It's good.

233
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:45,308
- Hold on, hold on.
- I didn't do it.

234
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:47,181
I didn't do it!.

235
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:52,176
- Get him out of here.
- I didn't do it!

236
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:54,821
Call it in. Call it in!

237
00:34:47,058 --> 00:34:48,934
Damn.

238
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,528
Check on the other side.

239
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:12,563
It's clear here.

240
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,115
I'm outta here.

241
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:56,468
Agent Ross.

242
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:59,145
- Where is he?
- He's in the morgue.

243
00:35:59,146 --> 00:36:01,035
Let's go.

244
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:09,326
This is just how he came in.

245
00:36:11,898 --> 00:36:14,223
It's the same handwriting.

246
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,499
Same drawing, right?

247
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,571
That's him.

248
00:36:22,287 --> 00:36:24,907
I want to see the location, please.

249
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:26,965
Thank you.

250
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:31,444
- Oh, I shouldn't drink.
- No, you shouldn't.

251
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,441
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

252
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:37,373
Yeah, you can tell that to the Judge
in ten days' time, at your hearing.

253
00:36:40,192 --> 00:36:41,348
What's going on down there?

254
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:44,321
Nothing. You can sign this form,
and then you can go.

255
00:36:44,322 --> 00:36:45,413
- Really?
- Yeah, really,

256
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,619
but I'm quite sure
the judge will send you back here.

257
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,862
- I'd probably deserve it.
- Oh, you're just lucky no one got hurt.

258
00:36:57,361 --> 00:36:58,733
Okay, now, back up.

259
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:07,912
You're gonna have to lock it down.

260
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,310
Hey, it was after the fact,
I didn't think anybody would...

261
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,769
You gotta do it, okay?
Nobody in, nobody out, please.

262
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:19,488
You heard that man. Lock it down.
Nobody in or nobody out.

263
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:57,183
I wanna see paper, on everybody in
and outta this station in the last 24 hours.

264
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,337
And I want the tapes.

265
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:05,971
From all the security cameras.

266
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:07,768
All of them.

267
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,221
<i>- It's all okay?
- We're good.</i>

268
00:38:53,222 --> 00:38:55,655
- When you're back?
- The day after tomorrow.

269
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:58,206
Look, I have something for you.

270
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:00,069
Give me a day.

271
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:01,124
Okay.

272
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:02,997
We can't wait to see you back.

273
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,724
- Give mama a kiss for me.
- I will.

274
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:15,836
Twenty-two murders in the last four years
all with the same MO.

275
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,393
I think I'm right,
he is sending a message...

276
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:20,311
but I'm beginning to believe
it's not meant for us.

277
00:39:20,312 --> 00:39:22,460
Well, we're the only ones
with that information.

278
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,476
Well, we're not getting anywhere
with it, are we?

279
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:26,905
Put it out to the press.
It's time.

280
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,034
The word, this lipstick drawing,

281
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:35,406
I want it splashed over every newspaper,
every magazine, front page, national.

282
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:36,580
The message ain't meant for us.

283
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:39,074
Let's make sure it gets
to who it's intended for.

284
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,263
Mr. Richard.

285
00:39:55,236 --> 00:39:57,398
- Marco.
- It's been a long time.

286
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:59,091
Yes, it has.
How is the hand?

287
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:01,891
It only hurts...
when it's humid.

288
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:04,948
Well, you should've let us relocate you
to Arizona instead of New Orleans.

289
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:07,975
Yeah, right,
but the boss likes it humid.

290
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:09,260
He's waiting for you.

291
00:40:13,258 --> 00:40:14,365
What do you think?

292
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:16,064
Hm?

293
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:18,510
- Coincidence.
- Twenty-two times?

294
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:21,143
A flower that only grows
in one place on earth?

295
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:26,333
Couldn't it be the calling card of...
shoot, I forgot his name.

296
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:28,175
What's his name,
your former partner,

297
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,094
you know, the one who used to do
your wetwork?

298
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:33,644
<i>- Fabio.
- Fabio.</i>

299
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:35,757
Fabio Restrepo.

300
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:37,022
May I?

301
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:42,228
The CIA is not an amusement park.

302
00:40:42,613 --> 00:40:46,403
When the agency extracted your ass
from Colombia 15 years ago...

303
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:49,841
and set you up here, we allowed you
to resume you little business,

304
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:52,239
but what we should've done
was lock you away for life.

305
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,764
Now, in exchange,
you should've kept the information flowing.

306
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:57,827
- And I have.
- Not much.

307
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,958
- I have nothing to do with this.
- Then find out who did.

308
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:18,462
She's talking to us.

309
00:41:19,975 --> 00:41:21,183
Could be anyone.

310
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:26,867
You idiot. I told you,
everyone dead, down to the dog.

311
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,701
You screwed it up the first time.

312
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:33,761
Now, go fix it.

313
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,760
Each and every one of the victims
was a professional bad apple.

314
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:29,359
As for motive,
I'm narrowing it down to, uh...

315
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,662
payback, but, um...
not much else.

316
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:34,209
My best guess, Alexa Milshinova,

317
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:39,869
she made a career out of getting intimate
with high stake gamblers out of Vegas.

318
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:43,406
She would, uh... rip 'em off and then
send them to meet their maker.

319
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:45,965
Here.
D'Angelo James.

320
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,031
He tried to take over the heroin trade
from Houston

321
00:43:50,555 --> 00:43:52,772
From the, uh...
Gemini Cartel.

322
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,855
If you do not know, all there is to know
about these twins...

323
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:58,350
you should not be in this room.

324
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,302
Now you see,

325
00:44:02,303 --> 00:44:05,478
he tilts the camera just enough,
so he won't be seen going into the cell.

326
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:07,860
The Time:
1:55 am.

327
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:10,603
That means that our perp
was in that station, that...

328
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:13,550
I don't have to spell it out for you,
do I?

329
00:44:14,356 --> 00:44:17,704
Excuse me.
Hand these out, please.

330
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:22,039
These are the names, addresses
and phone numbers of everyone...

331
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,516
with a pulse who was in that station
before 1:55 am.

332
00:44:27,093 --> 00:44:30,763
Everyone.
Which means one of them was our target.

333
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:34,564
I want you to locate the ten people
in the folder you've just been handed.

334
00:44:34,565 --> 00:44:38,745
I want a detailed dossier on each of them
for the last ten years of their lives.

335
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:42,757
I want you to run down every lead,
we will check every story.

336
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:45,421
'Coz our killer, ladies and gentleman,
is in those folders...

337
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:48,321
and I mean to catch him
before he kills again.

338
00:45:17,504 --> 00:45:18,623
Don't move.

339
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:23,844
Hello, Jennifer.

340
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:26,547
Hello, Danny.

341
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,249
You haven't finished painting.

342
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:43,089
Never really finished painting,
I just stopped working on it.

343
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,639
I know something
you're gonna finish.

344
00:45:53,748 --> 00:45:54,853
Tell me something.

345
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:58,606
Are we ever gonna go
on a normal date together?

346
00:45:58,607 --> 00:45:59,758
What's a normal date?

347
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:03,428
Well, you know. Go out, have dinner,
drink wine, get drunk.

348
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,018
Hm...
Dessert?

349
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,693
- Safe?
- From my end. And you?

350
00:47:25,396 --> 00:47:27,896
- Safe.
- How's Mama?

351
00:47:29,227 --> 00:47:33,415
- She... is missing you.
- Well, tell her I miss her back.

352
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:36,426
I think
she would love to hear that from you.

353
00:47:36,427 --> 00:47:37,387
I know.

354
00:47:38,346 --> 00:47:39,522
What do we got?

355
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:46,576
Remember the guy on the news for running
a Ponzi scheme about a year ago?

356
00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:47,440
Mh-hm.

357
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:50,913
Made 50 million dollars and vanished
into thin air. Clever guy.

358
00:47:50,914 --> 00:47:52,404
Now he's living in the Caribbean.

359
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:53,748
- No.
- Mh...

360
00:47:53,844 --> 00:48:00,440
So, he left a lot of people very upset.
Want to give him a break, permanently.

361
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,730
There's something else.

362
00:48:12,393 --> 00:48:14,488
How long has this been going on?

363
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:23,102
- Not long.
- The newspaper says, 22.

364
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:26,290
- Why?
- You know why.

365
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:29,635
You think this is going to smoke
Don Luis out? You think he's that stupid?

366
00:48:29,828 --> 00:48:32,484
It's not just about you, okay?
Cataleya?

367
00:48:32,965 --> 00:48:35,202
There's me, Mama, and my family.

368
00:48:35,299 --> 00:48:37,067
- Familia?
- Okay.

369
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,315
Tio, please.

370
00:48:39,562 --> 00:48:43,443
You're clean. You book the work,
you collect the money...

371
00:48:43,444 --> 00:48:46,394
The problem is,
I watch your back, that's why.

372
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:50,766
Each and every job,
I make a dollar with, if I give you a job,

373
00:48:50,863 --> 00:48:54,973
I turn down five, ten, because
I made a promise to keep you safe.

374
00:48:55,487 --> 00:49:00,018
I'll keep you safe. Cataleya, that is
a full-time job, no matter what you think.

375
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:02,790
But this is not a professional,
it's not what I do...

376
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,265
I don't care, about what's professional
and what's safe. I'm doing this my way.

377
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:08,285
- That is your way?
- Yeah.

378
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:13,835
A dead killer, is stupid.

379
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:18,592
Please, start listen...

380
00:49:20,128 --> 00:49:21,764
I should never have let you do this.

381
00:49:23,971 --> 00:49:29,753
You didn't let me do anything.
I chose this, remember? I chose this...

382
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,265
From the first moment
I walked in your door,

383
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,664
- I had already made my decision.
- By yourself?

384
00:49:35,665 --> 00:49:36,720
Yes.

385
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,746
Not you, or anybody,
are gonna change that.

386
00:49:45,189 --> 00:49:47,245
We love you, Cataleya.

387
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:54,702
Then watch my back
until it's done.

388
00:50:08,216 --> 00:50:09,271
Cataleya.

389
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:12,269
- Excuse me?
- It's an orchid.

390
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:15,380
- That's what this is?
- Sure does.

391
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:17,631
- It grows in Colombia.
- How do you know that?

392
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:19,273
My wife, she's Colombian.

393
00:50:21,267 --> 00:50:24,076
- Uh, uh... Cataleya?
- That's right.

394
00:50:34,922 --> 00:50:36,382
AMAZON

395
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:40,015
Let's try 'organization'.

396
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,086
What's this shit?

397
00:50:50,823 --> 00:50:53,011
Hi, boys.
Did you miss me?

398
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,097
I've missed you too.

399
00:50:58,136 --> 00:50:59,715
Hi. Come!

400
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,713
Have you guys been good?
Hm?

401
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,246
Alright.
Stay.

402
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:09,480
Sirloin...
Juicy.

403
00:51:09,481 --> 00:51:12,832
Delicious.
Want one?

404
00:51:13,025 --> 00:51:13,925
Good.

405
00:51:20,926 --> 00:51:21,839
Eat.

406
00:51:31,007 --> 00:51:34,828
I know that song.

407
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:38,239
- I guess the boys gave me away, huh?
- You spoil them.

408
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,343
I train them.

409
00:52:04,244 --> 00:52:08,592
Fishie, fishie...
Willy, why are they ignoring me?

410
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:14,228
- What?
- Baby, you put one drop of blood in there,

411
00:52:14,229 --> 00:52:17,311
- and they'll be your biggest admirers.
- Really?

412
00:52:17,408 --> 00:52:22,161
Oh yeah, baby. All the way down
to your clean, stripped bones.

413
00:52:22,546 --> 00:52:24,164
Cool...

414
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:32,345
Alejandro, you bring in
extra security for tonight.

415
00:52:32,346 --> 00:52:33,208
Yes, sir.

416
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:36,658
And make sure
that we are shut down, tight.

417
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:37,714
Yes, sir.

418
00:52:42,428 --> 00:52:45,656
Girls, come to papa, huh?

419
00:52:58,296 --> 00:53:00,636
There already guys in the garden
and guys out back.

420
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:02,293
- I want you three upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

421
00:53:03,253 --> 00:53:04,281
Two on the roof.

422
00:53:06,585 --> 00:53:07,448
Hurry!

423
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:24,454
Jesus, what is this?

424
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:38,141
- Come back to bed.
- Shh...

425
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:18,332
Who the fuck is here?

426
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:40,169
Turn around.

427
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:53,132
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter who I am.

428
00:55:54,859 --> 00:55:56,106
Damn it!

429
00:55:58,997 --> 00:56:02,453
- Okay. What do you want?
- I want you exactly where you are.

430
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:10,547
Whatever they pay,
I'll double it.

431
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:14,615
- Please... please don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

432
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:20,700
Oh, no, no, please.

433
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:50,061
Yeah.

434
00:56:50,062 --> 00:56:51,988
- Mr. Steven Richard?
- Who is this?

435
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:54,131
This is FBI special agent James Ross.

436
00:56:54,324 --> 00:56:56,108
Look, I'm the lead agent on a case,

437
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:59,274
it's a serial we call the tag killer.
You might've heard of him?

438
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:04,000
- I've seen the publicity.
- He mocks his victims with a flower.

439
00:57:04,097 --> 00:57:06,815
It's from Colombia.
A cataleya orchid.

440
00:57:06,816 --> 00:57:09,406
Each time I try to access
information I get stuck...

441
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:11,613
with a CIA "Access Denied" tag...

442
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:14,152
I'm at the end of a very long road,
Mr. Richard,

443
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:16,454
and I believe
that you are the man I need...

444
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:20,930
Listen, Agent Ross, I can't give any
information out over the phone,

445
00:57:20,931 --> 00:57:24,586
but what I suggest is you file
a formal request with the agency...

446
00:57:24,587 --> 00:57:25,833
for any information you might want.

447
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:28,574
And I'll be more than happy
to get back to you as soon as I can.

448
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,002
Thank you.

449
00:57:43,787 --> 00:57:48,010
Stop bullshitting me, Marco.
I got the FBI on my ass now.

450
00:57:48,106 --> 00:57:51,293
And I want that problem taken care of
yesterday, do you hear me?

451
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:53,522
- Loud and clear.
- Good.

452
00:58:00,231 --> 00:58:02,332
- Where to?
- Downtown.

453
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:04,964
And we question
every Colombian we meet...

454
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:08,320
until we find an address
to get her family. Okay?

455
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,595
<i>In case you show up,</i>

456
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:37,762
<i>I want to let you know that I went
to New York to meet the galleries.</i>

457
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:39,769
<i>I'll be back tomorrow night,</i>

458
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:43,319
<i>but if you're already here,
make yourself at home.</i>

459
00:59:08,996 --> 00:59:09,964
What have we got?

460
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:12,747
We do have the surveillance tapes
from a few angles.

461
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,995
Few angles.

462
00:59:19,342 --> 00:59:20,656
- That's it?
- That's it.

463
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,274
- I mean, it's not a lot to go on...
- Oh, come on...

464
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:24,098
but run it through the database,
see what happens.

465
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,793
We're not looking for a woman.
It's not possible.

466
01:00:00,566 --> 01:00:03,702
- And wine.
- Thank you.

467
01:00:05,879 --> 01:00:08,476
- Come on.
- I'm impressed.

468
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:13,827
I got you something.

469
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,665
- You did?
- Yeah.

470
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:22,217
- A stuffed alligator?
- Yeah.

471
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,752
Exactly what I've always wanted.

472
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,627
Wait, wait.

473
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:36,689
Let's just, uh...
let's just sit,

474
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,896
have a little of this food
and talk for a little bit first.

475
01:00:41,108 --> 01:00:42,276
What you wanna talk about?

476
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:47,241
I don't know. Anything.
Ask me something.

477
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,402
- How was your trip?
- Actually it was great.

478
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:55,272
The gallery liked my new paintings,
they're gonna put up a show in October.

479
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:58,157
- And that's a good thing, right?
- Yeah.

480
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:01,349
My turn.
How was your trip?

481
01:01:04,282 --> 01:01:06,831
- Hot.
- Did you do anything exciting?

482
01:01:07,312 --> 01:01:09,543
- I went swimming.
- Anything else?

483
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,553
- Come on. Talk to me.
- What do you wanna know?

484
01:01:16,554 --> 01:01:20,376
Anything. Something about you.
Something...

485
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,343
Where are you from?

486
01:01:26,013 --> 01:01:27,940
Are your parents from here
in the city?

487
01:01:33,945 --> 01:01:34,904
Okay...

488
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:37,000
let's start with
something a little more simple.

489
01:01:37,001 --> 01:01:38,439
What do you like to eat
for breakfast?

490
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:40,201
I don't eat breakfast.

491
01:01:42,005 --> 01:01:43,277
I'm not gonna hurt you.

492
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:46,287
I just wanna know
a little bit more about you.

493
01:01:46,288 --> 01:01:48,782
About what you feel inside.
What you feel about me, anything.

494
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:50,478
Just a little.

495
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,588
I feel lonely sometimes.

496
01:02:06,136 --> 01:02:08,762
Thank you.
Me too.

497
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:31,616
Let me this time.

498
01:03:15,214 --> 01:03:16,130
Good morning.

499
01:03:19,372 --> 01:03:22,163
I know you say you don't eat breakfast,
so I thought I'd make us some lunch.

500
01:03:23,242 --> 01:03:24,105
Shit.

501
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:26,550
- Wait. Where you going?
- I shouldn't have done this.

502
01:03:26,935 --> 01:03:28,926
- Shouldn't have done what?
- Any of it.

503
01:03:28,927 --> 01:03:31,659
I don't understand. Why?
What're you talking about? Why?

504
01:03:31,852 --> 01:03:33,521
- Because...
- Because...? Look...

505
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:35,441
can you just hold on a second?
Can we just talk about this?

506
01:03:35,537 --> 01:03:38,078
No, no, Danny.
We've talked too much.

507
01:03:38,174 --> 01:03:41,124
- Jennifer, just stay for a minute.
- I'm sorry. I have to go.

508
01:03:41,892 --> 01:03:42,756
Jennifer!

509
01:03:54,593 --> 01:03:55,691
I'm sorry I'm late.

510
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:58,870
<i>Look!</i>

511
01:04:01,209 --> 01:04:04,828
Eight people, slaughtered in Miami.
One of them is my friend.

512
01:04:05,664 --> 01:04:07,741
- So what?
- You know exactly what.

513
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:11,104
- It's getting too close.
- Ay, Tio, please. Again, with that?

514
01:04:11,105 --> 01:04:14,073
They are looking for you.
Don't play with me.

515
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:19,702
You'll bring me in for sure.
I know how your twisted little mind works.

516
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,697
Do you think this is a game?
I'm a fucking joke to you?

517
01:04:25,713 --> 01:04:26,576
Hm?

518
01:04:27,854 --> 01:04:29,966
But you scare me, Cataleya.

519
01:04:30,638 --> 01:04:32,748
I won't deal with your shit anymore.

520
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:35,821
I won't give you work,
or anything, anymore.

521
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:38,491
You are retired.

522
01:04:39,451 --> 01:04:41,362
<i>- You can't do that.
- Quiet!</i>

523
01:04:42,986 --> 01:04:45,412
How many people did you kill
when your boy died?

524
01:04:48,724 --> 01:04:52,381
- How many?
- What you know my son?

525
01:04:52,957 --> 01:04:55,674
You know fucking nothing
about my son.

526
01:04:57,114 --> 01:04:58,456
Tell me.

527
01:04:58,821 --> 01:05:00,421
But it changed nothing.

528
01:05:01,825 --> 01:05:04,533
When I lose my son,
I lose my life.

529
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:06,701
Everything is important to me,
is gone.

530
01:05:07,493 --> 01:05:09,769
And I want to believe in you,
Cataleya.

531
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:15,651
Why? I still pray that you find a life,
away from this.

532
01:05:15,652 --> 01:05:19,542
Because no one in our entire family
has a chance for one.

533
01:05:24,723 --> 01:05:28,523
Listen. Never come to the house,
never come to the church.

534
01:05:28,908 --> 01:05:32,685
Don't bother. I don't wanna wait
for your phone call no more.

535
01:05:32,878 --> 01:05:35,148
I don't want you
to break my mother's heart.

536
01:05:36,492 --> 01:05:40,087
Maybe this
will help you to understand...

537
01:05:40,472 --> 01:05:42,382
what I'm trying to tell you.

538
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:54,085
Oh, poor daddy.

539
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:13,629
Well, hazel, actually.

540
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:16,656
Dark hair.
Thick, shiny.

541
01:06:17,136 --> 01:06:19,342
Incredible body.
Killer smile.

542
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:23,271
- I think about her all day long.
- Dude, you're in love.

543
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:25,124
You're so smart.

544
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,810
Okay, seriously, and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

545
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:29,435
you're nuts.

546
01:06:29,436 --> 01:06:31,930
I haven't had anyone important
in my life for at least ten years.

547
01:06:32,026 --> 01:06:33,940
I finally find someone
that I really, really like,

548
01:06:33,941 --> 01:06:36,146
that I...
that I wanna be with all the time.

549
01:06:36,723 --> 01:06:38,806
I've got nothing.
I've got a stuffed animal and a picture.

550
01:06:40,534 --> 01:06:42,378
You got a picture?
Give it up.

551
01:06:43,147 --> 01:06:46,745
It's not even really a whole picture.
I took of her while she was sleeping, so...

552
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,145
- Oh, myGod...
- Jesus, relax.

553
01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:52,065
When do I get to meet
the future Mrs. Delanay?

554
01:06:52,066 --> 01:06:53,224
You? Never.

555
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,318
Excuse me, excuse me,
why are you writing a ticket?

556
01:07:08,193 --> 01:07:12,244
- Third Precinct.
- You got that picture?

557
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,638
Hello, skinny face,
lying on my computer.

558
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:19,154
Oooh, she is beautiful.
Clearly out of your league.

559
01:07:19,155 --> 01:07:22,243
It's not for me, it's for Danny.
Remember, the painter?

560
01:07:22,244 --> 01:07:24,637
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Much better match.

561
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:26,269
It's a perfect match.
How long is this gonna take?

562
01:07:26,365 --> 01:07:29,349
Slow down, tiger. You're my
brother-in-law, not my boss.

563
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:30,970
And besides,
I'm not supposed to be doing this.

564
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:31,930
Sorry, sorry.

565
01:07:32,026 --> 01:07:36,101
You are gonna be the fairy godmother
in the most beautiful love story ever.

566
01:07:36,293 --> 01:07:37,828
Okay? Think about it.

567
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:40,791
You get the honor of saying you were
the one, who made this all happen.

568
01:07:40,888 --> 01:07:43,722
And I get to lose my job
if I get caught.

569
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:50,048
Brian, it's done.
I'll call you when I got something, okay?

570
01:07:50,049 --> 01:07:51,549
Thank you, babe.

571
01:07:58,917 --> 01:08:00,281
You'll thank me later.

572
01:08:11,442 --> 01:08:13,785
Hey, I want a trace put on
an incoming transmission.

573
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,790
Chicago, third precinct.
Get somebody down there now.

574
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:16,856
That was such a nice surprise.

575
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:21,788
- Everyone grows up sometime.
- She's gonna be okay.

576
01:09:23,352 --> 01:09:26,095
Yes, Mama.
I think so.

577
01:09:43,172 --> 01:09:45,582
- Uh... excuse me?
- Come with me, please.

578
01:09:45,775 --> 01:09:48,513
That's my computer! Why is she...
why are you all up on my computer?

579
01:09:48,514 --> 01:09:50,573
- You have the right to remain...
- You better not mess up my favorites!

580
01:09:52,027 --> 01:09:54,778
We have a base, sir...
Let's try size.

581
01:09:55,451 --> 01:09:57,863
Good. Now...
Let's see hands.

582
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,215
Looking good.
Now...

583
01:10:04,778 --> 01:10:06,665
Hm...
nice nose.

584
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:10,386
Congratulations.
You have a girl.

585
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:13,612
Print it.
Get it out to all stations.

586
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:16,762
- And get the mobile unit ready.
- Yes, sir.

587
01:10:45,092 --> 01:10:46,925
- It's me.
- Jen?

588
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,434
Are you busy?

589
01:10:49,298 --> 01:10:50,735
No, no I'm not.

590
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:52,367
Now we do a name.

591
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,845
Positioning in progress...

592
01:10:55,134 --> 01:10:58,299
I was just
looking out the window and thinking,

593
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:00,814
- where are you?
- I'm... I'm at home.

594
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:02,350
I was looking out the window too.

595
01:11:02,446 --> 01:11:04,510
So we're looking at
the same star right now, huh?

596
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:06,915
- Almost there.
- You have a sexy voice on the phone.

597
01:11:07,395 --> 01:11:10,527
- Yeah, you do too.
- We've got it.

598
01:11:11,295 --> 01:11:13,582
Okay, we've got.
Give SWAT the location.

599
01:11:15,257 --> 01:11:16,275
Go!

600
01:11:19,124 --> 01:11:21,238
- I'm really glad you called me.
- Me too.

601
01:11:21,623 --> 01:11:24,136
I was literally just looking at a picture
of you, thinking of you,

602
01:11:24,137 --> 01:11:25,000
when the phone rang.

603
01:11:25,096 --> 01:11:26,846
- What picture?
- I took a picture of you...

604
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:27,901
while you were sleeping
with my phone.

605
01:11:27,902 --> 01:11:31,145
It's really bad, but I just wanted
to have something to remind me of you.

606
01:11:32,725 --> 01:11:36,157
- Did you show it to anybody, Danny?
- No. Well actually, to my friend Ryan.

607
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,715
- Who else saw the picture, Danny?
- Nobody. Why?

608
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,291
- Danny, who else?
- Nobody.

609
01:11:42,292 --> 01:11:43,826
I didn't show it to anybody,
what's the big deal?

610
01:11:49,955 --> 01:11:52,595
Look, I just took a stupid picture of you
with my phone. I'm sorry.

611
01:11:52,596 --> 01:11:53,807
I'm sorry too.

612
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,334
- Let's see what we got
- Special Agent Williams, FBI.

613
01:12:19,884 --> 01:12:20,862
It's clear.

614
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:11,986
No, ma'am,
everything's under control.

615
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,673
I just need you to come with us,
we're evacuating the building.

616
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:29,851
Charges.

617
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:50,515
Blow it.

618
01:14:22,993 --> 01:14:26,888
She's not here.
Lock down this building. ASAP!

619
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,091
- Anything?
- Naw, nothing.

620
01:15:00,307 --> 01:15:02,453
No, wait, wait, wait,
one security camera down.

621
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:04,675
- A second one down.
- Where?

622
01:15:04,676 --> 01:15:05,539
The garage!

623
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:07,686
- All units, get to the garage.
- Let's go, let's go!

624
01:15:07,687 --> 01:15:09,268
Cover all the damn exits.

625
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:46,303
She's here!

626
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,489
Look everywhere!

627
01:15:51,025 --> 01:15:55,412
Under every car, look in every room.
She's here. Find her!

628
01:15:58,786 --> 01:15:59,686
Anything?

629
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:01,989
Come on, check that booth,
she's here.

630
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:33,931
Tio!
Mama.

631
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:59,852
Mama.

632
01:17:01,388 --> 01:17:03,114
Oh, shit...

633
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:09,733
Emilio!

634
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:10,885
Emilio!

635
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:33,075
- This won't take long. Please. Sit.
- You think you've been smart.

636
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:39,085
Have you covered all your bases?
'Coz this... this is already over.

637
01:18:39,278 --> 01:18:42,650
- This whole place is wired with webcams.
- You mean these?

638
01:18:44,499 --> 01:18:48,002
Talk about covering all my bases:
Your chair is pressure-wired.

639
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:51,322
You move a single inch, and that'll be
the last move you ever make.

640
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:55,085
And given what you know about me,
you know I don't bluff.

641
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:04,228
I don't know about you.
So I'm just gonna ask...

642
01:19:04,517 --> 01:19:07,168
what happened to you,
that you could kill 23 people?

643
01:19:07,361 --> 01:19:12,375
Would you believe me if I told you
this wasn't the life I had imagined?

644
01:19:12,785 --> 01:19:16,427
When I was a child,
I wanted to be like you,

645
01:19:16,812 --> 01:19:19,099
- on the other side.
- Really?

646
01:19:20,218 --> 01:19:21,233
So what happened?

647
01:19:27,377 --> 01:19:28,816
This how it all went...

648
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:32,244
I was nine when he had
my parents killed,

649
01:19:32,929 --> 01:19:35,022
in front of me.

650
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,692
So all this... the tag killer?

651
01:19:38,693 --> 01:19:42,050
The clues... weren't for us at all,
they were all for him?

652
01:19:42,146 --> 01:19:43,523
It was the only way
I could track him down.

653
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:46,018
And you needed us
to put it all in the press?

654
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:49,197
Yes, but it took you
so fucking long.

655
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:50,253
Goddamn.

656
01:19:50,446 --> 01:19:53,701
You had to be really determined,
very focused, huh?

657
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:55,235
Not focused enough.

658
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:03,522
This morning
he took the last piece of me.

659
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:07,292
You sent the man a message,
he sent you one right back.

660
01:20:07,389 --> 01:20:08,936
And now
I'm gonna finish it.

661
01:20:10,088 --> 01:20:12,071
- Oh, I can't help you.
- Yes you can,

662
01:20:12,551 --> 01:20:13,893
he is protected by your government.

663
01:20:13,894 --> 01:20:17,971
By a part of my government
that I cannot reach. It's CIA...

664
01:20:18,067 --> 01:20:19,852
and I don't know why,
but I can't get under it,

665
01:20:19,853 --> 01:20:21,674
I can't get over it,
you have to believe me...

666
01:20:21,675 --> 01:20:25,054
- I have tried.
- Try harder, Agent Ross.

667
01:20:30,123 --> 01:20:31,438
You have a beautiful family.

668
01:20:31,822 --> 01:20:33,261
If you go anywhere
near my family,

669
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:34,988
- I swear to God, I'll...
- Shhh...

670
01:20:40,576 --> 01:20:43,773
Now you know what you have to do.
Get me Luis Sandoval.

671
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:49,162
Because if you don't, you're gonna go
to a funeral, every week.

672
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:55,032
And I will not stop, until you begin to feel
what I've felt all these years.

673
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,631
I'm sorry.

674
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:59,221
Cataleya.

675
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:04,618
When your dinner's ready,

676
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:08,359
the timer in your chair
will have expired.

677
01:21:08,935 --> 01:21:10,405
Don't get up before.

678
01:21:12,804 --> 01:21:13,764
Wait!

679
01:21:27,464 --> 01:21:29,874
Now, you do understand
that I only took this meeting...

680
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:31,601
out of professional courtesy?

681
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:33,443
Well, the truth is,

682
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,033
- I really can't help you at all.
- Can't, or won't?

683
01:21:36,034 --> 01:21:40,518
- It's the same thing, really.
- But in the, uh, spirit of reaching out...

684
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:45,659
Let me put my cards on the table.
I have met this woman.

685
01:21:45,756 --> 01:21:48,506
- This tag killer.
- It's a woman?

686
01:21:48,507 --> 01:21:49,990
- Yeah.
- Is she pretty?

687
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:51,526
She got the drop on me in my home

688
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:56,321
and she told me, that if I don't bring her
the whereabouts of this man, she says...

689
01:21:56,322 --> 01:21:59,854
she's gonna kill a member of my family
every week until I have none left.

690
01:21:59,855 --> 01:22:02,489
- Are you kidding me?
- Does it seem to you...

691
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,313
that I would make
something like this up?

692
01:22:04,408 --> 01:22:07,830
So why don't you just...
tell me what I should do.

693
01:22:08,943 --> 01:22:12,595
Call 911. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

694
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:14,170
It starts now.

695
01:22:21,077 --> 01:22:22,132
Ross.

696
01:22:29,796 --> 01:22:30,755
It's her.

697
01:22:30,852 --> 01:22:33,095
She says, if you don't give her
exactly what she wants,

698
01:22:33,096 --> 01:22:36,500
she's gonna redecorate your whole office,
with you.

699
01:22:41,191 --> 01:22:43,293
Can you please tell her that glass
is temperative resistant...

700
01:22:43,294 --> 01:22:46,171
to a direct hit by a 57mm ordinance?

701
01:22:58,532 --> 01:23:00,018
Ten seconds to give up that address.

702
01:23:00,019 --> 01:23:02,513
How can I be sure that if I give her
the address, she won't kill me anyway?

703
01:23:02,609 --> 01:23:04,610
She says you can't,
but you can trust me,

704
01:23:04,611 --> 01:23:05,708
if you do not give her
what she wants,

705
01:23:05,709 --> 01:23:07,915
you will be the 24th victim
on the hit parade.

706
01:23:11,707 --> 01:23:14,201
She asks that you keep this coversation
strictly confidential.

707
01:23:14,297 --> 01:23:17,181
- With pleasure.
- What about my family?

708
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:28,580
- Good morning.
- Who are you?

709
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:31,017
That's not important.
What's important is...

710
01:24:31,114 --> 01:24:33,991
I need the floor plants
to 8-6-7 Magnolia Terrace.

711
01:24:34,471 --> 01:24:38,000
If you don't leave my office immediately,
I will call the police.

712
01:24:38,289 --> 01:24:40,289
I really need those floor plans.

713
01:24:43,535 --> 01:24:48,072
You will take positions here...
here... and here.

714
01:24:48,361 --> 01:24:51,112
You must expect
the unexpected.

715
01:24:51,209 --> 01:24:54,531
She's like mist under a door.
Like a mouse on the wall.

716
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:56,236
She will never attack
straight on...

717
01:24:56,621 --> 01:24:59,019
and you will not see her
until it's too late.

718
01:24:59,414 --> 01:25:01,381
She's that invisible.

719
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:08,192
Let's go!

720
01:25:33,816 --> 01:25:38,225
Don Luis...
Don Luis, are you okay?

721
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:42,279
- Get the Mercedes.
- What happened?

722
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,412
- You need to get out of here.
- Leave me alone.

723
01:25:44,797 --> 01:25:46,604
Come on!
Come on, come on.

724
01:25:48,362 --> 01:25:50,642
<i>- Everybody in!
- Let's go! Quick!</i>

725
01:26:21,071 --> 01:26:23,960
We have to move.
Hurry!

726
01:26:24,728 --> 01:26:27,575
Come on.
You hide here.

727
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,690
- And wait for my call.
- Okay.

728
01:27:29,684 --> 01:27:31,893
- Did you get her?
- We're checking.

729
01:27:48,135 --> 01:27:49,372
I think we got her.

730
01:27:55,224 --> 01:27:56,087
Marco.

731
01:27:56,472 --> 01:27:57,335
Marco!

732
01:28:42,805 --> 01:28:43,887
Marco!

733
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:02,362
- What the hell is going on?
- I will hold here.

734
01:29:02,363 --> 01:29:03,322
Marco!

735
01:29:31,248 --> 01:29:34,028
You've been waiting for this moment
for a very long time, right?

736
01:29:34,701 --> 01:29:35,660
Yes.

737
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:24,018
Hurry.

738
01:32:27,355 --> 01:32:32,213
- Marco?
- No. It's Cataleya.

739
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:34,140
What were you expecting?

740
01:32:34,621 --> 01:32:38,266
You have ruined your whole life
trying to kill me, someone like me?

741
01:32:38,554 --> 01:32:43,897
I cannot be killed. I do the killing!
And now, it's your turn to be hunted.

742
01:32:43,994 --> 01:32:48,487
You will never find me.
But as the day follows night, believe me,

743
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:52,020
I will find you. And I will kill you.
And you know why?

744
01:32:52,308 --> 01:32:53,686
Because I will never be...

745
01:32:53,687 --> 01:32:57,332
- where you want me to be.
- Actually...

746
01:33:00,216 --> 01:33:02,229
you're exactly where I want you to be.

747
01:33:07,969 --> 01:33:09,088
Eat.

748
01:33:35,976 --> 01:33:39,964
You should think very carefully.
Is there anything else?

749
01:33:39,965 --> 01:33:41,268
I've already told you everything.

750
01:33:41,269 --> 01:33:43,283
Okay? She... she'd come by
for a couple of hours,

751
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:44,339
and then she'd leave, that's it.

752
01:33:44,722 --> 01:33:47,501
Look, it's really late, I'm really tired.
If you are not gonna arrest me...

753
01:33:48,077 --> 01:33:50,611
We don't actually have anything
to charge you with.

754
01:33:51,284 --> 01:33:52,898
- So, can I leave?
- No.

755
01:33:53,571 --> 01:33:58,012
- I got a few more questions.
- Can I at least get a cup of coffee?

756
01:33:59,358 --> 01:34:00,214
Yeah.

757
01:34:02,037 --> 01:34:04,153
- Cream and sugar?
- Yes, please.

758
01:34:11,389 --> 01:34:13,691
- Hello.
- Hello.

759
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:18,340
Jen? Thank God. Look, I... I had no idea,
I'm so sorry, are you okay?

760
01:34:19,396 --> 01:34:23,232
- I'm fine. Where are you?
- The FBI.

761
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,345
- Danny, you know that they...
- Yeah.

762
01:34:28,214 --> 01:34:31,494
- How much time do we have?
- Forty seconds.

763
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:36,329
- Gives us time for 3 more questions.
- What's your real name?

764
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:41,639
- Cataleya.
- Like the flower?

765
01:34:43,438 --> 01:34:47,477
Yes, like the flower.
Twenty Seconds.

766
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:49,745
Will my little bird
come back one day?

767
01:34:52,816 --> 01:34:54,926
Leave your window open
and you'll see.

768
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,328
- Hey, Ross?
- Yeah.

769
01:34:58,329 --> 01:35:00,081
We're picking something up
off that guy's phone.

770
01:35:01,425 --> 01:35:05,068
- Last question.
- I love you.

771
01:35:08,514 --> 01:35:13,552
Give me that phone. Give it!
Hello? Hello?!

772
01:35:32,897 --> 01:35:34,198
You can go.
