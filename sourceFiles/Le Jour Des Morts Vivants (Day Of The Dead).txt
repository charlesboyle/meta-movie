1
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,379
- Nothin', nothin' at all.
- Send it again.

2
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,381
I've been sendin' it up and down the coast 
from Sarasota to the everglades.

3
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,182
It's still getting back
the same day it aired.

4
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,887
There's nothing. There's nobody, 
or at least nobody with a radio.

5
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,515
All right then. Let's set down.
We'll use the bullhorn.

6
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,101
Set down? Wait a minute.
That's not in our contract.

7
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:45,644
It's the biggest city within 150 miles.
We're gonna give it every chance.

8
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:49,149
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
- Set down, John.

9
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,653
I'll set us down, but I won't leave my seat, and
I'll keep the engine running.

10
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:57,614
Now, the first sign
of trouble, I'm going up.

11
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:02,661
If you ain't on board when that happens,
you're likely to have a lousy afternoon.

12
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,596
Calling anybody
on this frequency.

13
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:12,557
This is helicopter 4-0-alpha.

14
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,601
If you can hear me,
please listen carefully.

15
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,001
Hello?

16
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:51,009
Hello?
Is anyone there?

17
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,261
Hello?

18
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:58,265
Hello?

19
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:01,893
Is anyone there?

20
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:09,900
Hello?
Is anyone there?

21
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:16,406
Is anyone there?

22
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,913
Hello?

23
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:29,167
Is there anyone there?

24
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,555
Hello?

25
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:54,315
Hello?

26
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,819
Is there anyone there?

27
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,239
Hello?

28
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,158
Hello?

29
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,663
Is anyone there?

30
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,170
Hello?

31
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:42,358
We can lift you out to safety. Please answer
my call if you can hear me.

32
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,363
Forget it, Billy boy.
It's a dead place.

33
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:50,866
They got the others, you know.

34
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:54,369
Listen.

35
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,872
You can hear it
over the engine.

36
00:05:58,873 --> 00:06:02,376
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

37
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,272
Hey, you find anything?

38
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:16,193
Yeah. A bunch of real estate for sale
at closeout prices, man.

39
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,653
Gas up the machine.
She's down to fumes.

40
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:22,323
No. Wait till it's dark.
There are too many of them out there.

41
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:25,410
Yeah-hey, it's no good
to leave the gas tank empty.

42
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:29,455
- Suppose we need to get out of here in a hurry.
- Then we're shit out of luck.

43
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:33,458
They're getting too riled up.
Do it tonight when they can't see you.

44
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:38,337
They know we're in here even if they can't see us.
What good is it to leave the gas tank emp...

45
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:42,216
The activity excites them. There are too many
of them. And more and more every day.

46
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:45,969
If we get a lot more, come out and shoot some.
Otherwise, stay inside the building.

47
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,972
Stay out of sight. Be thankful you live
in the suburbs, Johnson.

48
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:52,475
You oughta see how congested
the city's gettin' to be.

49
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:01,692
Miguel, come on.
Let's get below.

50
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:06,696
- Miguel, what can I do? You... you...
- What?

51
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:10,241
- Let me help.
- No. I... I don't need help. I don't need help.

52
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,743
- Come on. Give me this.
- I'm all right. I'm just tired.

53
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:16,247
- You're not. You're collapsing from stress. Now, let me help...
- Collapsing from stress?

54
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,249
We're all collapsing. This whole fucking unit
is collapsing...

55
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,251
everybody except you.

56
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,753
I know you're strong,
all right? So what?

57
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,257
Stronger than me. Stronger than everyone.
So what?

58
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,259
So fucking what?

59
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,405
- That's a new grave.
- Major cooper. He died this morning.

60
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:57,367
And then there were 12.

61
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:00,036
A burial this morning.
That's why there are so many of them.

62
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,680
What's gonna bring them tomorrow, Sarah?
And the next day and the next day after?

63
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,763
There are hundreds of 'em over there, thousands.
A million of them!

64
00:09:09,786 --> 00:09:14,140
You stick your head in the sun, they're gonna
come up  behind you and bite off your ass!

65
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:19,595
- This is bullshit. Crazy.
- If you've got an alternative, we'd be happy to listen to it.

66
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:22,057
I got an alternative.

67
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:26,101
Let's get the whirlybirdy good idea.
Find us an island someplace, get juiced up...

68
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:30,104
and spend what time we got left
soakin' up some sunshine.

69
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,565
- How's that?
- You could do that, couldn't you?

70
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:35,288
With all that's going on, you could do that
without a second thought?

71
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:40,113
Right. I could do that even if all 
this wasn't goin' on.

72
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:14,770
- Another waste of time, right?
- Got that right, man.

73
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:29,617
- What'd you find?
- Nothin'.

74
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:33,537
Nothin'? How far up the coast did you go?

75
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:36,623
A hundred miles each way.

76
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:40,167
Jump in here, soldier. We gotta bring in 
two more dumb fucks. Let's go.

77
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:43,670
- Two more? What's Logan doing to them in there?
- Get in here soldier.

78
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,173
He's been awake for 24 hours.
Can't you get anyone else?

79
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:49,634
What "anyone else"?
There isn't anyone else. We're it.

80
00:10:49,676 --> 00:10:53,179
The two of you can't go in there alone.
It's too dangerous.

81
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:58,642
Christ. I'll go!

82
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:02,188
- What's the matter with your friend there?
- There's nothing the matter.

83
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:05,065
All right. Let's go.

84
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,571
You got it, Steel.

85
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:45,601
Let's kick it out.
Come on. Step forward.

86
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:17,589
This shows the 15th as the last time you
took any out.

87
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,634
- That can't be right.
- Oh, yeah. We forget to write 'em up sometimes.

88
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:24,427
You've got to write them up.
It's essential.

89
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:27,097
Can't you get that
through your thick skull?

90
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:31,142
How the hell are we supposed
to keep track of how many we got left?

91
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:40,776
Let's go, you dumb fucks!
Get over here!

92
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,528
Hey! Here we are!

93
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,616
Come on!

94
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:53,746
Come on, you dumb fucks.
Come on. Come on.

95
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:59,251
Come on, you fish brains. 
What the hell's the matter with ya?

96
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,170
- They're scared.
- Huh?

97
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:06,382
They know what'll happen
when Frankenstein gets 'em.

98
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:10,094
If you're right, Rickles, then they're learning.

99
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:13,596
They're actually learning.
Come on!

100
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:18,518
Come and see what I got for you!
Come on, you dick faces!

101
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,437
Here's a nice one hangin'.
Come on. Come and get it.

102
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:27,192
- Come and try to bite it off!
- That's it. Whip it out. That'll bring 'em on.

103
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:31,695
Fuckin' "a."
Biggest piece of meat in the cave.

104
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:36,200
I don't wanna excite the lady though.
Not with her boyfriend around.

105
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:40,872
You're incapable of exciting me, Steel, except
as an anthropological curiosity.

106
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:45,083
- What the hell's that mean, Rickles?
- It means you're a caveman.

107
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:50,631
You're a fuckin' throwback.
You've been spendin' too much time underground, huh?

108
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:56,135
It's okay, Steel.
Throwbacks all got big dicks.

109
00:13:56,177 --> 00:13:59,596
Oh!

110
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,141
All right, you dumb fucks!
Get over here, you scumbags!

111
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:07,271
Your old pal Steel
wants to see ya.

112
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:11,232
- Shit.
- I'm coming up.

113
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:14,776
You're not strong enough for up here.
Send up the pole. I'll watch out for lover boy.

114
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:17,738
Don't worry. I'm not strong enough?
I've done it dozens of times.

115
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,783
I don't want you up here, lady.
Send up the pole. They're gettin' closer.

116
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:24,286
He's clamping. Look at 'im.
Let go of the pole.

117
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:28,247
Listen to me.
Let go of the goddamn pole.

118
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,791
Here they come! Let's go!

119
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:36,005
Dumb fucks.
Pus-breeding bags of shit.

120
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:40,550
You dumb-fucking bags of shit,
I'll kick your fuckin' asses. Come on!

121
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,933
Come here, scumbag.

122
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,824
Hook her up, will ya? Hook her.

123
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,204
Hey, nice hat, asshole.

124
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,708
Come on!
Get the other one out of there!

125
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:49,528
Steel, Steel, Steel,
cover! Cover!

126
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,991
I got it.
- Geez.

127
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:57,036
That's it. That's it.
That's it. I got it. I got it. Come on.

128
00:15:57,077 --> 00:16:01,039
Come on. Come here.
Come here.

129
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:14,176
You almost killed Rickles.
Yeah. You almost killed Rickles.

130
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:17,637
Let 'im go, Steel.

131
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,556
- He shouldn't have been
up there in the first place.

132
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:24,519
Steel, stop it!

133
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:29,064
You dirty son of a bitch!
Let him go! Let him go,

134
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:32,067
goddamn it,
or I'll cut you in half.

135
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:03,428
Shut up, you dumb fucks.
I hope they chop you up for dog meat.

136
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,431
Come on, Rickles.
Let's get out of here.

137
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:10,936
I hope you fuckin' rot!
Fuck you!

138
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:26,867
I am not gonna let you
dope me up.

139
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:33,831
You need a sedative.
You're behaving dangerously.

140
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:39,677
- I'm just trying to help you, Miguel.
- Well, I don't need your help, or anyone else's.

141
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:48,886
You made me look like an asshole out there.

142
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:52,389
You made me feel
like a piece of shit.

143
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:58,895
You stay away from me
with that, Sarah.

144
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:03,899
You stay away from me.

145
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:17,912
Ohh.

146
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:34,427
You bitch.

147
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:59,450
We've got to have sterile conditions.
Half the work we do...

148
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,910
goes down the toilet
due to contamination.

149
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:05,955
- You'll work with what you got, Fisher.
- But it's madness!

150
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:12,420
- Can't you understand...
- I understand this: You and your playmates,

151
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,922
you're running out of friends
fast around here.

152
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,514
Look, major cooper
promised that...

153
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:28,017
major cooper is dead.

154
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:33,021
I'm in command now,
and I'm telling you...

155
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:35,982
that you work
with what you got.

156
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:38,526
And you'd better
start showing me some results...

157
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:40,587
or you won't have that
very much longer.

158
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:44,031
How can we show you results when we don't have
the proper working conditions?

159
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:47,993
We're in a desperate situation here.
We need each other.

160
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:51,037
Can't we just get along? 
You need us, the way I see it, lady.

161
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,541
I'm not sure we need you at all.
Fuckin' "a."

162
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,505
I'm not even sure what the hell it is
you're doin' in there,

163
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:03,966
just what the hell my men
are riskin' their asses for.

164
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:09,512
If there was more cooperation, your men wouldn't
have to risk their asses as often.

165
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:17,228
- Miguel Salazar's in bad shape.
- No shit.

166
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:23,149
I want him pulled off active duty for a while
until we can evaluate his condition.

167
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:27,028
- Can't spare 'im.
- He's over the edge. He's turning into jell-o.

168
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:32,992
- Jell-o?
- That's the way the spicks say "yellow": Jell-o!

169
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:37,037
Miguel is seriously disturbed. 
He's close to the breaking point,

170
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,497
and that's dangerous
for all of us.

171
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,042
He can't handle
any more stress right now.

172
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:48,047
Well, maybe I should cut off
his extracurricular activities.

173
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,550
Maybe you're keepin' him too busy at night.

174
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:57,055
We're talking about a man's life here,
you son of a bitch.

175
00:20:57,096 --> 00:21:00,808
And the lives of others
he might put in jeopardy.

176
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:05,012
- Maybe I should put him in quarantine.
How about it, Steel?

177
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,792
You call it, Captain.
I'll build him a cage.

178
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:12,368
Yeah. Might not be a bad idea...

179
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:15,072
Give some of the rest of us a shot at some lovin'.

180
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:19,575
Hey, it's gonna
be a long winter.

181
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:25,664
Come on, Ted.
Let's get out of here.

182
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:28,708
I'm callin' a meeting
for 7:00 tonight.

183
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,671
I want everybody present.
Everybody, lady,

184
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:36,174
including dr. Frankenstein
and including your boyfriend.

185
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:39,634
- I gave him a sedative. He won't be awake.
- Look here, woman.

186
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:42,636
I'm short on man power.
I won't have you goin' around...

187
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:45,139
dopin' up any of my men
without orders from me.

188
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,225
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

189
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,728
Fuck you, sir!

190
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:56,566
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire.

191
00:21:56,567 --> 00:22:00,570
I thought cooper was an asshole, but he was 
a sweetheart next to Rhodes.

192
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:05,075
We could be in real trouble.
You'd better watch yourself... I mean, physically watch yourself.

193
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:08,578
I can handle it.
Don't worry. It's not going to come to that.

194
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,081
- We've just gotta pound some logic into their heads.
- Impossible.

195
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,583
Where's Dr. Logan?

196
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,628
Frankenstein?
He's in his laboratory. Where else?

197
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:25,092
There's a loss of initiative, caution,
many of the human cognitive functions.

198
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:29,096
Apparently the result of decay
in the frontal, parietal,

199
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:31,807
temporal and occipital lobes.

200
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:36,603
On revival, the rate of decomposition
slows substantially.

201
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:39,880
Indications are that these beings...

202
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:42,441
could function over a period of years...

203
00:22:42,483 --> 00:22:47,738
In cases of early revival, 10 to 12 years
before decay would threaten mobility.

204
00:22:56,996 --> 00:23:00,874
The brain is the engine, Sarah,
the motor that drives them.

205
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,502
They don't need any blood flow, don't need any
of their internal organs.

206
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:07,589
Now, I've severed all
the vital organs in this one.

207
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:11,134
There's nothing left of the corpse but brain
and limbs, and still it functions.

208
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:15,596
Oh, look, Sarah. Look.

209
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:20,017
See, it wants me.
It wants food, but it has no stomach.

210
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,978
It can take no nourishment
from what it ingests.

211
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,440
It's working on instinct, a deep, dark,
primordial instinct.

212
00:23:27,482 --> 00:23:31,902
Decomposition occurs first in the frontal lobes,
the neocortex,

213
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,906
and next in the limbic system,
the middle brain.

214
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:40,160
But the core... the core is the last thing to be
attacked by the decay.

215
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,664
It's the "r" complex, Sarah... that central bit of
prehistoric jelly...

216
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:47,666
that we inherited
from the reptiles.

217
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:52,296
Here. I've gone into the center here
and attacked the "r" complex discretely.

218
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:54,882
I've removed it from the equation...
this corpse.

219
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:59,427
I believe this creature would be benign even 
if it had its eyesight and its other senses.

220
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:02,429
Its primitive instincts
have been erased.

221
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:17,068
It still has motor function,
probably still has powers of deliberation.

222
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:21,406
It can be domesticated,
Sarah, don't you see?

223
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:25,451
It can be conditioned to behave the way
we want it to behave.

224
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:29,329
And all that's required
is 15 hours of fancy surgery...

225
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,290
that only a handful of people
are trained to do.

226
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:36,336
We were going to stop work on the neurophysical,
concentrate on something more practical.

227
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:39,964
These finds are central to the condition.
I will not stop work...

228
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:44,801
that might lead to an answer, let alone
in an area that is central to the condition.

229
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:49,096
But you're just proving theories
that were advanced months ago.

230
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:53,101
And you're not even proving them correctly.
You're making a lot of assumptions.

231
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:57,604
You're wasting time trying
to define what's happening...

232
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:00,565
instead of looking
for what's making it happen.

233
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:04,110
And just slicing up too many specimens.
It's extremely dangerous...

234
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:06,071
to go up on top
and round them up in the wild.

235
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:10,074
Well, we can't control them.
What happened to this one?

236
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:13,619
It was too unruly.
I couldn't handle it. I had to destroy it.

237
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,123
- We can still get information from it.
- Dr. Logan,

238
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:20,626
we are losing
the cooperation of the men.

239
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:24,629
I'm not even sure they'll go up top when we
run out of the specimens we have.

240
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:28,382
I'm not sure they won't just try to 
shut us down completely.

241
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:32,844
Well, I'll show them results.
I'll show them results.

242
00:25:32,886 --> 00:25:37,891
I'll show them that these creatures 
can be domesticated even without the surgery.

243
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:42,395
Knowing what they are, we can
begin to approach them properly,

244
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,896
condition them, control them.

245
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:48,817
We've got to do this, Sarah.
It's our only hope.

246
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:04,289
Yes, this is major cooper.

247
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:09,419
I needed him, Sarah. He's helping us more now
than he ever did when he was alive.

248
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,340
- But I saw the grave.
- They buried one of the specimens.

249
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:18,552
Jesus. God, Logan.

250
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:22,056
Do you know what they'll do to you
if they find out about this?

251
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:26,101
- Do you know what they'll do to all of us?
- They'll never find out.

252
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,854
He can't be recognized.

253
00:26:54,877 --> 00:26:59,297
Not a peep. Long-range or short, high-band or low, 
I can't raise anybody.

254
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:02,760
How can that be, McDermott?
There must be other groups like us.

255
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:06,761
- Somebody else must be tryin' to radio.
- Yeah. What the hell is this?

256
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:09,724
- Maybe we are the only ones left.
- I'm sure there's others.

257
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:13,768
This is not the best place to be sending from,
and a lot of the equipment I'm using...

258
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:16,271
has been rotting down here
since the second world war.

259
00:27:16,312 --> 00:27:19,482
Well, it's up to you
to get it workin' right.

260
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:23,027
Lay off the fuckin' booze
for a while, why don't ya?

261
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:26,430
And get somebody
on that fuckin' horn, pronto.

262
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,034
Well, if we stay down here long enough,
I'll have to lay off the fuckin' booze, Steel,

263
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:34,996
'cause there won't fuckin'
be any of it fuckin' left.

264
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:40,543
In the meanwhile, I will continue to indulge myself,
and I will continue doing my best...

265
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:43,504
in the good fight
against dry rot and rust.

266
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:48,049
Yeah? Well, your best
ain't good enough, asshole.

267
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,553
You think I'm not aware of our situation?
You think I want to stay isolated down here?

268
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:55,056
You know, I'd make a desperate
effort to raise somebody...

269
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:57,558
just in the hope of gettin' away
from your nasty mouth, Steel.

270
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,060
The fact is...

271
00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:05,106
the fact is...

272
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:10,111
either we are
the only ones left...

273
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:14,156
or there's nobody within range of my puny little
second world war signals.

274
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:16,839
We used to talk to Washington all the time.
They could hear us then.

275
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,619
We were on relays then.
We weren't over the air.

276
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:22,663
You know, the power's off on the mainland now,
in case you haven't heard.

277
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:28,628
- All the shopping malls are closed.
- We don't appreciate your jokes.

278
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:32,673
Keep it up, and I'll shove that bottle of yours
right up your wise ass.

279
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:36,551
I've got better things to do than listen 
to this kindergarten. Are we finished?

280
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:40,013
No, we ain't
finished here, lady. Sit down.

281
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:43,516
What else do you want?
We've given you the reports for this week.

282
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:47,061
- We've given you everything you've asked for.
- You've given us greek salad.

283
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:52,565
Formulas, equations, a lot of fancy terms
that don't mean a thing.

284
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:58,613
I wanna know if you're doin' something that's gonna
help us out of this deep shit we're in,

285
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:03,075
or if you're all in there
just jerkin' each other off.

286
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:07,579
She doesn't have to jerk off like the rest of us, Captain.
She got an honest-to-god dick...

287
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,874
to get off on, huh?

288
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,085
It may be yellow,
but it's still a dick!

289
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:20,215
I said we ain't
finished here, lady.

290
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:23,218
Sit down.

291
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:26,471
Sit down, or so help me,
god, I'll have you shot.

292
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:31,976
- You'll what?
- I said,

293
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:34,937
"I'll have you shot."

294
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:38,481
Have you lost your mind?
No, ma'am.

295
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:46,906
Have you? I just told you I was willing 
to kill you if you didn't get back in your chair.

296
00:29:46,948 --> 00:29:49,867
You didn't get back
in your chair.

297
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:53,078
Goddamn it!
You can't shove us around like this.

298
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,247
Since when did this
become a military operation?

299
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:01,753
Since I took over.
Steel, shoot that woman.

300
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:05,256
Bang! You're dead.

301
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,432
Shoot that woman
or you're dead.

302
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:18,851
You think
I'm fuckin' around, Steel?

303
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:22,353
You're wrong.

304
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:26,524
Now, you got till a count of five,
and that's two you wasted.

305
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,570
That's three.

306
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,613
- Four.
- Sit down, Sarah.

307
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:35,615
What is this?
Shut up and sit down.

308
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:39,119
That's five, Steel.
All right.

309
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:42,665
All right.

310
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:54,300
No!

311
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:14,569
Anybody else have any questions about the way
things are gonna run around here from now on?

312
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:32,334
This ain't
a goddamn field trip, people.

313
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:35,837
This is a fuckin' war!

314
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:40,341
I'm not down in this cave for my health.
I'm down here on orders.

315
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:44,554
Your orders are to facilitate
the job of this scientific team.

316
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:49,600
This is a civilian team, and we don't have to be
subjected to your tyranny.

317
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:53,728
Who's being subjected
to what, Fisher?

318
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,106
You've lost one man.
Yeah. Right.

319
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,443
We've lost five.

320
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:05,489
Where does it say we gotta keep those dumb fucks
next door to where we sleep?

321
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:10,493
Where does it say we should do any one thing
but shoot the mothers in the head?

322
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:15,999
We don't have enough ammunition
to shoot them all in the head.

323
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,960
The time to have done that
would've been at the beginning.

324
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,464
No. We let them overrun us.
They have overrun us, you know.

325
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:27,967
We're in the minority now.

326
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:31,471
Something like 400,000 to one,
by my calculations.

327
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:34,432
I haven't eaten.
Is there food?

328
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:38,435
You were supposed to be here at 7:00 sharp,
mister.

329
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:41,730
I know. Sarah told me.
I'm sorry. I couldn't break away. Is there food?

330
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:44,982
- Listen, egghead, let me bring you up to date on what's...
- Excuse me.

331
00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:46,943
- Let me...
- Excuse me!

332
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:51,614
- Is there food?
- I'm runnin' this monkey farm now, Frankenstein,

333
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:56,618
and I wanna know what the fuck
you're doin' with my time!

334
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:03,832
'Cause if we're just
jerkin' off here,

335
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,460
I'm gonna have my men
blow the piss...

336
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:09,463
out of those precious specimens
of yours,

337
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:14,884
And we're gonna get the hell out of here  and
leave you and your highfalutin asshole friends...

338
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,387
to rot in this stinkin' sewer!

339
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:20,390
Is that food enough for ya?

340
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:26,353
Where will you go, Captain?
You can destroy my specimens,

341
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:29,522
but what about the millions more
that are waiting to greet you outside?

342
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:33,025
Do you really think you can "blow the piss"
out of them?

343
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:38,030
All of them? They have you
in a hopeless situation, strategically.

344
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:42,618
You're lost. Well,
you're lost unless...

345
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,122
- Unless what? Unless what, Frankenstein?

346
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:49,624
- Unless you can make them behave.

347
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:53,669
This is a fuckin' loony bin! I ain't bein'
paid enough to work in a fuckin' loony bin!

348
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:58,089
- I ain't bein' paid at all!
- Paid? What the hell are they payin' him for?

349
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,595
All right. Shut up!
Just shut up!

350
00:34:05,097 --> 00:34:08,599
What the hell are you
talkin' about, Frankenstein?

351
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,061
I'll be able to show you soon enough.
Sarah knows.

352
00:34:12,102 --> 00:34:16,105
She's seen the progress I've been making.
Isn't that right, Sarah?

353
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:19,108
Yes. There's been some progress.

354
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:22,571
What kind of progress?

355
00:34:22,612 --> 00:34:26,114
What are you talkin' about, "make them behave"?
What does that mean?

356
00:34:26,115 --> 00:34:29,368
It means keeping them from wanting to eat us,
for one thing.

357
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:33,956
It means keeping them in check,
controlling them.

358
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:38,627
- Controlling them.
- When are you gonna show us something we can understand?

359
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:41,288
Very close. Very close.
I think in a matter of weeks...

360
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:45,214
I don't think there's any way you can tell
how long anything is going to take.

361
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:49,220
It could be months, it could be years
before we know exactly what we're dealing with.

362
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,221
Sarah's research...

363
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:57,727
Sarah's research
is more esoteric than mine.

364
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:02,772
She's looking for a way to reverse the process,
a way to eradicate the problem.

365
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:06,026
That could take a long time,
a very long time.

366
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:08,904
She may never find
what she's looking for.

367
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:11,781
We have a limited supply
of chemical agents.

368
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:14,784
Our equipment
is hopelessly inadequate.

369
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:20,414
McDermott doesn't
have decent radio gear.

370
00:35:20,915 --> 00:35:24,876
Now you're tellin' me that you don't
have the shit you need?

371
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:29,172
We're runnin' low on ammunition.
We're runnin' low on men, for chrissakes!

372
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:33,425
It was very rushed. This operation
was put together in a matter of days.

373
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:37,680
Yeah, well, it can all be taken apart 
in a matter of minutes, lady,

374
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:41,933
and I'm here to tell you that I'm ready to
do that little thing.

375
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,394
I'm ready to
take the next train outta here!

376
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:47,396
I ask you again, Captain:
Where will you go?

377
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:50,942
You have no choices. You'll have 
to give us the weeks that we've asked for.

378
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:54,903
You have to give us however long it takes.
Look.

379
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,406
- There have to be survivors in Washington.
- My ass.

380
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,208
- They have more sophisticated shelters than this one.
- Bullshit.

381
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:03,953
There have to be people in those shelters
who know about us, who know where we are.

382
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,456
With no radio contact,
they'll come looking for us.

383
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,458
I said shut up!

384
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:26,974
You got a little more time.

385
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:30,477
A little more.
I ain't sayin' how much.

386
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:38,484
But you'd better start showin' me some results,
and you'd better not piss me off.

387
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:43,989
You understand? Nothin' happens
around here without my knowin' about it!

388
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:51,079
And anybody fucks
with my command,

389
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:57,126
they get court-martialed,
they get executed.

390
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,633
You'd better know
I mean it, too, people.

391
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:19,979
He wouldn't have done it.
I can't believe he would've.

392
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:23,942
No, he wouldn't have done it.

393
00:37:23,984 --> 00:37:28,487
- He would've had Steel do it.
- He can't be that inhuman.

394
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:33,450
- No. He's human.
- That's what scares me, you know.

395
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:38,997
He won't shoot Billy 'cause he doesn't have 
anybody else who knows electronics.

396
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,959
He won't shoot me,
'cause I'm his ride.

397
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:48,505
He probably won't shoot old Frankenstein,
'cause the old doc can talk him silly.

398
00:37:49,506 --> 00:37:51,966
But the rest of you...

399
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:55,512
better start worrying,
you know.

400
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:05,771
Maybe if we tried working together,
we could ease some of the tensions.

401
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:09,775
- We're all pulling in different directions.
- That's the trouble, Sarah.

402
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:14,279
People got different ideas
concerning what they want out of life.

403
00:38:56,483 --> 00:39:00,487
You are afraid, aren't you?

404
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:05,116
Just as afraid as I am.

405
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:10,121
Why don't you take a sedative,
Sarah, so you can sleep?

406
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:17,626
You're full of shit, Sarah, you know that?
You're really full of shit.

407
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:21,422
I'm through with you.

408
00:39:21,464 --> 00:39:25,217
Fine then. Get out.

409
00:39:25,218 --> 00:39:28,220
Just get out!

410
00:40:32,444 --> 00:40:36,948
- Hey, guys! Come on, man!
- For goodness sake!

411
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:49,710
I'm all right.
Thanks, bill.

412
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,671
I'm all right.
Here.

413
00:40:53,713 --> 00:40:56,215
I've just filled it up.
Got a refill as well.

414
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:58,969
No, thanks.
I'm all right. Really.

415
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,721
It's just brandy.
Good for the heart.

416
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:05,224
It's shit for your heart,
and it eats up your liver.

417
00:41:54,977 --> 00:41:58,981
We don't get a lot of visitors out here,
and we like it that way.

418
00:42:00,482 --> 00:42:03,985
Here it is: The Ritz.

419
00:42:04,027 --> 00:42:05,987
Madam.

420
00:42:13,368 --> 00:42:16,371
John's probably out the back.

421
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:30,175
Hey! Well,
what do you know.

422
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:34,221
Welcome to civilization, Sarah.

423
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:38,307
The last holdout.
It's pretty nice.

424
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:42,311
Nicer than we got inside.

425
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:48,275
- Not a bad idea.
- It's a little safer where you are.

426
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:50,819
But we like to live dangerously,
Billy boy and me, you know.

427
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,322
That's a laugh. I haven't seen you do
anything dangerous since we got here.

428
00:42:56,323 --> 00:43:00,827
We stickin' around.
That's gettin' a bit dangerous,

429
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,331
as I hope you noticed
this evening.

430
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:09,836
You're a mystery to me.

431
00:43:10,836 --> 00:43:12,838
You really are.

432
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:17,843
Not like
those other goons in there.

433
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:22,347
You have a sense of...

434
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:26,809
Of what?
Never mind.

435
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:29,812
No, no, no.
Come on. Let's talk about it.

436
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:32,315
I came down here to get drunk.
I don't have the energy.

437
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:38,361
Hey, hey. It takes more energy to keep quiet
than it does to speak the mind.

438
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:41,864
Go ahead.
Let go of what you got, now.

439
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:46,327
You were sent down here
to do a job.

440
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:50,873
My job is to fly the whirlybird.
I've been doin' that job just fine.

441
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:54,376
You have the protection of this facility.
You eat our food. You drink our water.

442
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:58,379
And you don't lift a finger to help.
Neither one of you.

443
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:17,355
We don't believe in what you're doin' here, Sarah.

444
00:44:17,397 --> 00:44:21,359
Hey, you know what all they keep down here
in this cave?

445
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,905
Man, they got the books and the records of
the top 500 companies.

446
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:30,366
They got the defense department
budget down here.

447
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:33,411
And they got the negative
for all your favorite movies.

448
00:44:33,912 --> 00:44:38,791
They got microfilm with tax return
and newspaper stories.

449
00:44:38,832 --> 00:44:41,793
They got immigration records,
census reports,

450
00:44:42,294 --> 00:44:44,796
and they got official accounts of all the wars
and plane crashes...

451
00:44:44,837 --> 00:44:48,758
and volcano eruptions and earthquakes and fires
and floods...

452
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,303
and all the other disasters that interrupted
the flow of things...

453
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:55,764
in the good old U.S. Of A.

454
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:59,309
Now, what does it matter,
Sarah darling?

455
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:02,353
All this filing
and record keeping?

456
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:07,650
We ever gonna give a shit?
We even gonna get a chance to see it all?

457
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:14,030
This is a great big 14-mile tombstone!

458
00:45:14,156 --> 00:45:16,699
Tombstone!

459
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:20,912
With an epitaph on it
that nobody gonna bother to read.

460
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:24,790
Now, here you come... here you come with
a whole new set of charts...

461
00:45:24,832 --> 00:45:27,251
and graphs and records.

462
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:31,296
What you gonna do?
Bury them down here with all the other relics...

463
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:33,298
of what once was?

464
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:39,720
Let me tell you what else.
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you what else.

465
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:45,725
You ain't never gonna figure it out.
Just like they never figured out...

466
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:48,687
why the stars are where they're at.

467
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:53,233
It ain't mankind's job
to figure that stuff out.

468
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:56,861
So what you're doin'
is a waste of time, Sarah.

469
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:59,863
And time is all we got left, you know.

470
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:06,745
What I'm doing...
is all there's left to do.

471
00:46:06,787 --> 00:46:09,706
Shame on you.
There's plenty to do.

472
00:46:10,206 --> 00:46:15,336
Plenty to do. So long as there's you and me 
and maybe some other people,

473
00:46:15,836 --> 00:46:20,340
we could start over, start fresh,
get some babies.

474
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:24,844
And teach 'em, Sarah, teach 'em never to come
over here...

475
00:46:24,886 --> 00:46:29,223
and dig these records out.

476
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:34,687
Hey.

477
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:40,232
You want to put some kind
of explanation...

478
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:43,945
down here before you leave?

479
00:46:43,986 --> 00:46:47,990
Here's one as good as any 
you're likely to find.

480
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,163
We're being punished by the creator.

481
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:59,466
He visited a curse on us...

482
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:03,970
so we man could look at...

483
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:12,179
what hell was like.

484
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:19,184
Maybe didn't want to see us
blow ourselves up...

485
00:47:19,226 --> 00:47:23,188
and put a big hole in his sky.

486
00:47:23,189 --> 00:47:28,693
Maybe he just wanted to show us 
he was still the boss man.

487
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:34,240
Maybe he figure...we was getting too big
for our britches...

488
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,245
trying to figure his shit out.

489
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:32,959
You son of a bitch!

490
00:48:35,461 --> 00:48:38,465
Damn it!

491
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:42,426
It's no good.

492
00:48:42,468 --> 00:48:46,972
It's no fuckin' good.
What is that stuff?

493
00:48:47,472 --> 00:48:49,474
It's something called beef treats,
which the army provides us with...

494
00:48:49,974 --> 00:48:51,476
so generously.

495
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:54,479
- He won't touch it.
- Shit. I wouldn't either.

496
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:57,440
Sorry. We're fresh out
of filet mignon.

497
00:48:57,482 --> 00:49:00,859
- What is this?
Part of Logan's plan...

498
00:49:00,901 --> 00:49:04,362
to try
and socialize these things?

499
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:08,992
He told me himself they don't eat for nourishment.
What are we hoping for here?

500
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:13,246
Hoping to satisfy the urge.
You see, Sarah, they're...

501
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:16,707
... they are us.
They are the extensions of us.

502
00:49:16,749 --> 00:49:22,337
They are the same animal, simply functioning
less perfectly.

503
00:49:22,378 --> 00:49:27,008
They can be fooled, you see?
They can be tricked into being good little girls and boys,

504
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:32,012
the same way we were tricked into it on 
the promise of some reward to come.

505
00:49:32,454 --> 00:49:34,473
They have to be rewarded.

506
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:38,017
Reward is the key.
I'm convinced of that now.

507
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,145
Come. I've got something
to show you.

508
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:53,281
That wasn't very nice, you know.
That wasn't very nice at all.

509
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,243
Let's go.

510
00:49:56,285 --> 00:50:02,039
And you can just sit there in the dark 
and think about what you've done.

511
00:50:02,415 --> 00:50:05,417
Think about it.
Think.

512
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:21,931
I call him Bub.

513
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:27,312
That's what the club fellas used to call my father.
Can you imagine a surgeon called Bub?

514
00:50:27,354 --> 00:50:30,690
Nobody seemed to mind,
though. He was rich.

515
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:33,692
My father was rich.

516
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:38,197
He used to say
I'd never be rich doing pure research.

517
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:41,200
I'd never be rich.

518
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,704
Uh, Bub's been responding so well lately,
I've let him live.

519
00:50:47,705 --> 00:50:52,750
Well, is he alive or dead?
Well, that's the question these days, isn't it?

520
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:57,255
Well, let's say that I let him
continue to exist.

521
00:50:57,256 --> 00:51:00,717
Hello, Bub!

522
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:05,012
Here are some toys for you.

523
00:51:05,013 --> 00:51:09,266
Some nice things
for you to play with.

524
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:15,522
You remember them from before?
From before.

525
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:24,613
Well, he's seen the other things before,
but the book is new.

526
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:38,292
Look, look, look.

527
00:52:10,946 --> 00:52:15,451
I thought he'd do that.

528
00:52:26,085 --> 00:52:29,089
Open it up.

529
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:34,593
He remembers.
He remembers everything that he used to.

530
00:52:39,139 --> 00:52:44,144
Bub, I'm very pleased.
Very pleased.

531
00:52:44,186 --> 00:52:47,105
What's he trying to prove?

532
00:52:47,146 --> 00:52:49,648
I saw one of those things
sittin' in a car in d. C...

533
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:53,110
tryin' to drive
down independence avenue.

534
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:56,154
- It didn't make me wanna be its friend.
- No. It's amazing.

535
00:52:56,196 --> 00:52:58,657
It's not what this one does,
but what he doesn't do.

536
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:01,117
What do you mean?
He doesn't get excited...

537
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:04,662
and doesn't get agitated when 
Logan walks in the room.

538
00:53:04,704 --> 00:53:09,166
He doesn't see Logan as...
...lunch.

539
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:13,127
Dinner.
Breakfast.

540
00:53:13,169 --> 00:53:19,133
Having fun?
What's he doin' in there?

541
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,761
No need for that, Captain.
He's quite docile.

542
00:53:23,762 --> 00:53:27,265
Come in.
You can all come in.

543
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:29,268
Bub won't mind.

544
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:59,044
Extraordinary, isn't it?

545
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:13,015
That's right, Bub.
Say hello.

546
00:54:13,056 --> 00:54:15,559
Come on, Captain.
Give me a break, will ya?

547
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:19,563
Say hello to your aunt Alicia.

548
00:54:19,604 --> 00:54:22,065
Say, "hello, aunt Alicia."

549
00:54:22,565 --> 00:54:26,026
"Hello, aunt Alicia."

550
00:54:26,068 --> 00:54:31,073
- Hel-lo, aunt Alicia.
- "Hello."

551
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:51,591
Apparently, he was in the military.
Return the salute and see what he does.

552
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:56,095
You want me to salute that pile
of walking pus?

553
00:54:56,137 --> 00:54:58,555
Salute my ass.

554
00:54:58,597 --> 00:55:02,560
Your ignorance is exceeded only by your charm,
Captain.

555
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:07,606
How are we going to set an example for them
if we behave barbarically?

556
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:10,775
Take the bullets out, please,
and let me have your pistol, Sarah.

557
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:48,392
It's empty, Captain.
We saw the bullets come out.

558
00:55:48,393 --> 00:55:52,396
Let's see what he does.
Let's see what Bub does in this situation.

559
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:07,743
Jesus... Christ.

560
00:56:22,256 --> 00:56:27,260
What are we supposed to do?
Teach 'em tricks?

561
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:32,014
What the fuck is wrong with you people?
They're dead!

562
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:36,269
They're fucking dead,
and you wanna teach 'em tricks?

563
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:41,774
They have to be rewarded, Captain.
Why else will they do what we want them to do?

564
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,984
I don't want 'em
to do anything but drop over!

565
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,028
Yes, well, apparently they're not inclined
to do that for you, Captain.

566
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,740
Is this your progress?

567
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:54,243
Is this the shit that's supposed
to knock our socks off?

568
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:59,790
It's the beginning, yes.
It's the bare beginning of social behavior.

569
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,751
Of civilized behavior.

570
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:07,797
Civil behavior is what distinguishes us
from the lower forms.

571
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:12,259
It's what enables us
to communicate,

572
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:17,555
to go about things in an orderly fashion, 
without attacking each other like beasts.

573
00:57:17,931 --> 00:57:21,935
Civility must be rewarded,
Captain.

574
00:57:22,936 --> 00:57:26,189
If it isn't rewarded,

575
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,400
there's no use for it.

576
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:32,944
There's just no use
for it at all.

577
00:57:42,953 --> 00:57:46,456
'Possum ready?

578
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:50,961
Come on. Grab it.
Come on.

579
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:52,921
You got it?

580
00:57:52,963 --> 00:57:56,466
Hey. You got it?

581
00:58:07,726 --> 00:58:10,729
No!

582
00:58:17,734 --> 00:58:21,697
No! No!

583
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:24,241
Miller! Miller!

584
00:58:32,623 --> 00:58:38,628
I can't do it.
I can't do it!

585
00:58:38,629 --> 00:58:42,757
I can't do it.

586
00:59:04,526 --> 00:59:07,989
Don't let this happen.

587
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:12,950
Don't let this happen to me.
I don't wanna be one of them.

588
00:59:12,951 --> 00:59:17,955
Take me. Please. Take me.

589
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:15,257
I need fire.

590
01:01:09,806 --> 01:01:12,309
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

591
01:01:22,817 --> 01:01:25,320
Get out of the way, lady.

592
01:01:25,696 --> 01:01:30,200
No. I amputated the infected area.
I think I caught it in time.

593
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,661
Yeah?
But what if you didn't?

594
01:01:33,702 --> 01:01:36,580
If I didn't,
I'll shoot him myself.

595
01:01:36,622 --> 01:01:38,915
It's the spick.

596
01:01:38,957 --> 01:01:43,462
The yellow son of a bitch.
It's his fault this happened. It's his yellow fuckin' fault.

597
01:01:43,503 --> 01:01:47,465
Get out of the way, bitch,
or I'll go right through you with this.

598
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:57,474
We're getting to make this a habit, man... 
Pointing guns at each other, you know.

599
01:01:57,724 --> 01:02:00,227
We just lost two men
'cause of this motherfucker.

600
01:02:00,352 --> 01:02:04,313
Weli... that kinda evens
the odds between us then.

601
01:02:04,355 --> 01:02:07,858
The spick's been bit, Captain.
We gotta blast him.

602
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,236
- He's been bit!
- I got the infection in time.

603
01:02:11,277 --> 01:02:13,822
That's bullshit, lady.

604
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:17,826
I seen a thousand of 'em.
He's gonna die.

605
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:21,328
If he dies,
I'll destroy him myself.

606
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,331
Unless he gets you first.

607
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,711
You may still want to sleep
with him.

608
01:02:29,753 --> 01:02:32,380
I don't want him
inside the complex.

609
01:02:32,422 --> 01:02:34,966
We'll keep him out here,
with us.

610
01:02:36,092 --> 01:02:39,595
We gotta blast him, Captain.

611
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:51,314
That'd be doin' 'im a favor,
Steel.

612
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:55,567
You think he wants
to walk around after he's dead?

613
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:58,571
You think he wants to be
one of those things?

614
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:02,741
Think about it, lady.

615
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:05,743
And think about this,
all of ya...

616
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:08,746
From now on, you ain't gettin' shit
from me and my men.

617
01:03:08,788 --> 01:03:12,791
Tomorrow morning, we're going inside that corral,
and we ain't comin' out...

618
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:17,254
... till every one of those rotten piles 
of garbage has been wasted.

619
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:24,802
Come on, Steel.

620
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:37,313
Get out of there, Steel!
We got better things to do!

621
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:44,821
You're on my shit list, flyboy.

622
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:04,338
Thank you.

623
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,842
Let's take him inside, clean him up.

624
01:04:08,883 --> 01:04:10,843
Think you can move him?

625
01:04:13,345 --> 01:04:15,348
I-I think so.

626
01:04:34,865 --> 01:04:38,368
It's all right.
It's okay.

627
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,871
Shh, shh, shh.

628
01:04:43,372 --> 01:04:45,375
Shh, shh.

629
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:09,771
- It's a man's sweater. Try it on.
- Thanks.

630
01:05:14,776 --> 01:05:17,279
I have to go to the lab.

631
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,782
He's going to need
some morphine...

632
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:23,242
along with some other supplies.

633
01:05:23,284 --> 01:05:28,788
I'd better go along. I'm sure those boys 
haven't calmed themselves down yet.

634
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:33,919
I'm sorry I said
those things about you.

635
01:05:34,419 --> 01:05:37,422
I'm sorry too. Really.

636
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:39,924
Well, what do you know?

637
01:05:39,965 --> 01:05:42,426
We are heroes after all.

638
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:44,528
What a relief.

639
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,941
Sarah.

640
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:03,845
He might not make it, you know.

641
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:06,347
I know it.

642
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:09,850
At least we gave him a chance.

643
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:13,053
I'll keep an eye on him.

644
01:06:13,054 --> 01:06:14,773
Hey.

645
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:19,359
You guys be careful. You're not back in half an hour,
I'm coming out to look for you.

646
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:21,861
They'll leave us alone.

647
01:06:24,363 --> 01:06:26,615
Half an hour.

648
01:06:26,657 --> 01:06:28,867
We'll be back.

649
01:06:51,388 --> 01:06:53,848
Jesus god almighty.

650
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:58,394
The resident surgeon has been 
burning the midnight oils.

651
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,153
What the hell has he been doin' down here ?
Slaughtering cattle?

652
01:07:08,653 --> 01:07:11,656
In his mind, that's probably
not far from the truth.

653
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,761
Grandfather's talking.
His mind's talking.

654
01:07:35,803 --> 01:07:41,057
There. I've put it away. I've put it away, mother.
I've put it away.

655
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:47,563
- Bastard. Be civilized!
Be civil.

656
01:07:47,604 --> 01:07:50,566
Christ! Take that off.

657
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:56,071
Take that off! Take that off!

658
01:07:56,112 --> 01:07:59,740
Five minutes, mother.
Just five minutes.

659
01:08:01,492 --> 01:08:04,995
Oh, my god.

660
01:08:04,996 --> 01:08:08,499
Oh, my god.

661
01:08:11,877 --> 01:08:14,962
No, Sarah! Don't!

662
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:17,506
It'll just bring out
Rhodes and the men.

663
01:08:17,548 --> 01:08:20,008
Leave it be, leave it be.

664
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:25,472
Let's go.
Let's get outta here.

665
01:08:25,514 --> 01:08:30,518
I'm beginning to think we should take
that helicopter before somebody else does.

666
01:08:51,663 --> 01:08:53,664
Hello, Bub.

667
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,922
Mother is very proud of you.

668
01:09:02,964 --> 01:09:05,674
Very, very proud indeed.

669
01:09:05,716 --> 01:09:08,428
You did quite nicely today.

670
01:10:36,006 --> 01:10:40,260
I don't believe it.
Logan's star pupil.

671
01:10:42,512 --> 01:10:46,766
- Now, tomorrow, we can play
with these things again.

672
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:50,769
Now it's time for your reward.

673
01:10:52,646 --> 01:10:54,648
I brought you something good.

674
01:11:11,288 --> 01:11:13,540
What is that?

675
01:11:13,582 --> 01:11:15,792
Is that...

676
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:22,047
it can't be.

677
01:11:23,048 --> 01:11:27,553
Oh, god. I can't look.
Can't...

678
01:11:33,808 --> 01:11:38,812
Good night, Bub.

679
01:11:39,312 --> 01:11:42,816
- What are you givin' him in there, Frankenstein?
- What?

680
01:11:42,858 --> 01:11:46,194
- Huuh!
- What is it, huh?

681
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:50,340
What do you give him?

682
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:05,211
Scum!

683
01:12:05,253 --> 01:12:09,555
No, you... you must listen to me,
Captain. You must listen.

684
01:12:09,556 --> 01:12:11,559
Listen to this.

685
01:12:19,149 --> 01:12:21,651
Hold it, Fisher.

686
01:12:21,693 --> 01:12:24,195
Torrez, get his gun.

687
01:12:24,236 --> 01:12:26,655
Take all the guns.

688
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:31,160
All of 'em.
All their fucking guns!

689
01:12:31,202 --> 01:12:33,078
Take all their guns.

690
01:12:33,578 --> 01:12:35,580
All their guns!

691
01:12:36,581 --> 01:12:39,542
Those are my men in there.

692
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:43,588
My men.
Those are my men in there!

693
01:13:40,013 --> 01:13:42,640
Hold it right there.

694
01:13:45,143 --> 01:13:47,603
Frankenstein's dead.

695
01:13:47,645 --> 01:13:52,149
This scum gets it next unless 
you throw your weapons out right now.

696
01:13:52,191 --> 01:13:54,651
He means it, Johnny.
He killed Logan in cold blood.

697
01:13:54,693 --> 01:13:58,614
I killed Logan
because he was a butcher.

698
01:13:58,655 --> 01:14:03,159
I'll kill the rest of them one at a time, unless 
you get your black ass out here, flyboy.

699
01:14:20,925 --> 01:14:25,929
- Let him go, Rhodes.
- Torrez, get his machete.

700
01:14:28,933 --> 01:14:31,393
We're gettin' outta here
right now.

701
01:14:31,435 --> 01:14:34,437
You give me any shit about it,
I blow his head off.

702
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:36,898
Whirlybird can't hold us all.

703
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:41,943
"Us all" ain't going.
Me, my men, you. That's it.

704
01:14:42,069 --> 01:14:44,070
You'll never get me to do that,
Rhodes.

705
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,909
No!
Hey!

706
01:14:49,951 --> 01:14:55,456
Rickles, open the gates.
Steel, shove 'em in there.

707
01:15:02,588 --> 01:15:05,090
Have a nice visit
with McDermott, huh?

708
01:15:10,094 --> 01:15:15,599
Rhodes...
don't do this, please.

709
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:18,560
Gonna give us a ride, flyboy?

710
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:22,605
I'll do whatever you say, man.
Let her go now.

711
01:15:29,611 --> 01:15:32,573
Rhodes. Let 'em off.

712
01:15:32,615 --> 01:15:36,618
I'll take you...
wherever you want to go.

713
01:15:37,118 --> 01:15:41,122
Like you said,
chopper can't hold us all.

714
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:47,128
Rhodes, don't do it.

715
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:51,089
You do it, and I won't fly.

716
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:55,134
I swear, you got to kill me
before I fly.

717
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:03,643
Let 'em out.
That's the deal.

718
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:10,147
I make the deals around here,
not you.

719
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:14,151
Now you get your shit together,
whatever you need.

720
01:16:14,193 --> 01:16:16,653
Isn't there
an old silo back there?

721
01:16:16,654 --> 01:16:19,155
No. We can't go back there
without guns.

722
01:16:19,156 --> 01:16:22,659
- We can't stay here. They'll tear us apart.
- Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

723
01:16:25,412 --> 01:16:27,413
Don't shoot 'im!

724
01:16:28,915 --> 01:16:31,918
We need his ass.

725
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,172
Steel, kick him around
a little bit.

726
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:42,177
Might knock some sense
into that jungle-bunny head.

727
01:16:52,311 --> 01:16:56,814
- Captain!
- That's it.

728
01:16:56,815 --> 01:16:58,817
Run, you fuckin' lunatics.

729
01:17:01,819 --> 01:17:04,072
Oh!

730
01:17:04,114 --> 01:17:06,324
Uuh!

731
01:17:28,093 --> 01:17:33,098
They're gone, flyboy.
Let's go.

732
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:36,559
Not a chance.

733
01:17:40,604 --> 01:17:43,607
- Jesus Christ. That's the elevator.
- Check it out.

734
01:18:34,152 --> 01:18:36,613
Aw, Jesus.

735
01:18:36,655 --> 01:18:39,157
Rock slide.
We can't get through.

736
01:18:40,658 --> 01:18:43,661
This way.
We can try and get around.

737
01:18:48,165 --> 01:18:50,668
Aah!

738
01:19:30,703 --> 01:19:33,205
Oh, it's you.
This way.

739
01:19:42,964 --> 01:19:45,466
Let's go, Torrez. Get up.

740
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,973
Uuh!

741
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:30,172
Aw, shit!
Somebody took this apart.

742
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:34,177
The only other control's up on the platform
with a hand box.

743
01:20:34,218 --> 01:20:36,928
Stuck.

744
01:20:36,929 --> 01:20:41,934
- Rickles, we can't get out of here.
- Fix it. Can't you fix it?

745
01:20:41,976 --> 01:20:46,438
- It's that fuckin' spick that did this!
- Fix it!

746
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,939
- Come on, man!
- Fix what?

747
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:53,945
- Fix the box, man! Come on! Fix it!
- They tore the guts out!

748
01:20:53,987 --> 01:20:56,447
- I can't fix it!
- We got the book here! We can fix it!

749
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:11,085
The bastard.

750
01:21:23,847 --> 01:21:25,974
Sarah!

751
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:29,435
Willie!

752
01:21:30,936 --> 01:21:33,438
John!

753
01:21:51,955 --> 01:21:52,455
Uuh!

754
01:21:58,962 --> 01:22:00,963
Let's keep moving.

755
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:12,974
Aha!

756
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:19,480
Uuh!

757
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:21,410
Hold down. Aw, fuck!

758
01:23:21,911 --> 01:23:24,872
What's goin' on?
That spick.

759
01:23:24,913 --> 01:23:27,166
He ripped these controls out,
the little yellow bastard.

760
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:31,503
The little shit.

761
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:34,005
The little fuckin' shit.

762
01:23:34,047 --> 01:23:37,049
You tried to make a run for it.

763
01:24:11,705 --> 01:24:13,708
Holy shit.

764
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:17,211
Holy fuckin' shit.

765
01:24:43,526 --> 01:24:46,528
Rhodes!

766
01:24:46,529 --> 01:24:49,531
Rhodes, you bastard!

767
01:27:16,622 --> 01:27:18,249
Oh, shit!

768
01:27:23,378 --> 01:27:26,380
Aah! Shit!

769
01:27:30,008 --> 01:27:32,011
Fuck!

770
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:39,017
Ha, ha!

771
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:47,024
Holy shit!

772
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:32,940
Shit!

773
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:36,903
Rhodes! Goddamn, Rhodes!

774
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:39,947
Open the door,
you son of a bitch!

775
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:44,367
Rhodes!

776
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:36,414
Shit!

777
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:47,257
Come on, Bub.

778
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:50,802
Come on, you pus-brained
bag of shit.

779
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:55,807
You wanna learn how to shoot, Bub?
I'll teach you how to shoot.

780
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:58,434
Come on, you bag of...

781
01:30:39,263 --> 01:30:39,763
Oh!

782
01:30:57,404 --> 01:31:00,406
Let's go. Follow the red lights.

783
01:31:13,543 --> 01:31:18,422
- It's temporarily out of service.
- The ladder! Go ahead. Up, up.

784
01:31:18,464 --> 01:31:20,424
Up!

785
01:31:52,077 --> 01:31:54,539
Come along, Johnny.

786
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:59,084
We're countin' on ya
to fly us to the promised land.

787
01:32:35,867 --> 01:32:39,245
Come on, come on.
Come on!

788
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:42,290
Oh, shit!

789
01:32:42,373 --> 01:32:43,874
Aah!

790
01:32:46,376 --> 01:32:48,378
Uuh!

791
01:32:55,302 --> 01:32:57,553
You fuck.

792
01:33:00,556 --> 01:33:02,558
Aah!

793
01:33:08,563 --> 01:33:12,067
You pus fuck! You fuck!

794
01:33:14,569 --> 01:33:18,572
You pus fuck! You pus fuck!

795
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:30,083
You f... aah!

796
01:33:41,718 --> 01:33:43,720
Come on!

797
01:33:44,721 --> 01:33:48,224
Come on! Come o-o-on!

798
01:33:50,851 --> 01:33:53,853
Come o-o-on!

799
01:33:54,854 --> 01:33:56,857
Come o-o-on!

800
01:33:59,859 --> 01:34:02,361
Come o-o-on!

801
01:34:03,362 --> 01:34:05,322
Come o-o-on!

802
01:34:50,404 --> 01:34:50,948
Salazar!

803
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:58,412
Salazar!

804
01:36:14,856 --> 01:36:18,359
Let's hope they filled up the gas tank
from the other night.

805
01:36:19,485 --> 01:36:22,487
Oh, my god.
Come on, come on!

806
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,627
Get in, get in!
