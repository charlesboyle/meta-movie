1
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:48,606
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

2
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,900
<i>We clear on that?</i>

3
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:56,030
<i>This is a live project.
You're a go.</i>

4
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:59,367
<i>You're a go.</i>

5
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,828
<i>Training is over.
Training is over.</i>

6
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,914
<i>Training is over.
Training is over.</i>

7
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,463
I'm okay. It's fine.

8
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,258
Just a headache.

9
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:06,309
<i>You're burning up.</i>

10
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:21,407
It's okay.

11
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,994
Just a headache.

12
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,976
Anything new?
No.

13
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,064
It's just bits and pieces.

14
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,318
I can hear Conklin's voice...

15
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,448
And there's that photograph, but...

16
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,618
I just can't stay with it.

17
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:07,954
But you're sure it's not just a bad dream?
It happened.

18
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,331
It was a mission.

19
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,502
And I was there.

20
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:17,755
You should write it down.

21
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:23,178
Two years we're scribbling in that notebook...
It hasn't been two years.

22
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,514
It's always bad, and now it's just
the same thing over and over again.

23
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:32,020
But that's why we write it down.
Because sooner or later, you remember something good.

24
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,317
I do remember something good.

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,569
All the time.

26
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,216
<i>I want one final go around.
All teams listen up.</i>

27
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:47,137
<i>We are standing by for final green.
Survey Two, I need to know when you've got eyes.</i>

28
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:51,599
<i>This is Survey Two. I have eyes.
Copy that.</i>

29
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:55,937
<i>Survey One, this is Hub.
Do you have visual contact?</i>

30
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,442
<i>Hub, this is Survey One.
Mobile One is in motion.</i>

31
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:09,451
<i>Survey Three, that is good.</i>

32
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:13,288
Hub.
Director Marshall from Langley.

33
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,123
Langley.
Stand by, please.

34
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:21,254
<i>Martin?
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller.</i>

35
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:24,924
We understand you're using the
full allocation for this buy.

36
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:27,135
It's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.

37
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:33,016
For a thief, a mole. If it does nothing more than narrow
the list of suspects, it's a bargain at 10 times the price.

38
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,352
<i>Hub, this is Survey Two.
Escort is breaking off.</i>

39
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,105
<i>Mobile One is entering the building.</i>

40
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:43,276
Gentlemen, I have the seller on-site and in play.
Quite frankly, there's nothing much more to discuss.

41
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:52,660
All right, Pam. Your call.
Go.

42
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,704
<i>We're on.
Audio contact only.</i>

43
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,791
<i>Switching to channel one now.</i>

44
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,667
<i>Copy that. It's affirmative.</i>

45
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:01,813
<i>Hub, Mobile One and seller
have entered the office.</i>

46
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,398
Copy that.

47
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,206
<i>This is everything?</i>

48
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,951
<i>Those were shots.</i>

49
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,794
Survey One, come in.
Survey One, I need to know what happened. What do you see?

50
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,921
<i>Do you see any shadows? I see nothing.
What is your visual?</i>

51
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:11,925
<i>Get some men in there. Get some men in there right now.
Pull it up, Kurt.</i>

52
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:16,304
<i>Eye contact. I don't care if it's visual...
Mobile One, can you copy, please?</i>

53
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:19,307
Are you there, Mobile One?
I'm sorry.

54
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:23,812
<i>What do you see?</i>

55
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,997
Petroleum Association's annual
conference here in Berlin...

56
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,042
Is Pekos Oil chief executive
officer Yuri Gretkov.

57
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,672
<i>In just six years, Gretkov has turned
Pekos into an oil empire, which in turn...</i>

58
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:58,179
He's become one of the
wealthiest men in Russia...

59
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:01,808
After consolidating drilling rights in the
Caspian Sea and gaining control of one of the wo...

60
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:57,238
How much?

61
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,852
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

62
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:37,440
He is my friend.
There's been a death in the family.

63
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:40,693
I wonder if you've seen him.

64
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:26,030
Hey.
Get in.

65
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,116
<i>What's wrong?
We're blown.</i>

66
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:31,119
How?
We pushed it. We got lazy.

67
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,758
<i>Idiot!</i>

68
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,431
All right. That's twice
now I've seen the same guy.

69
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,475
I saw him in town.
He was at the telegraph office.

70
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:55,894
Are you sure? How-how can you be sure?
It's just wrong.

71
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:58,813
The guy, the car he's driving,
what he's wearing... It's just wrong.

72
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,612
<i>Look, Jason, let's stay calm. It could be anybody.
This is real.</i>

73
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:09,324
This is real. That's him.
That's him right there.

74
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:12,368
<i>Get your head down.
Silver Hyundai. Get your head down.</i>

75
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:33,848
How far is he?

76
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:38,353
How far?

77
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:41,648
A hundred meters.

78
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:01,543
Here, take the wheel.
You're gonna drive.

79
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:05,421
Switch.

80
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,843
Just head to the bridge.

81
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,406
<i>Turn here. Cut through the field.
Hang on.</i>

82
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:23,291
All right, you keep going to the shack.
I'll meet you there in one hour.

83
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,669
I'm gonna bail out on the other side of this bridge.
It's the only way he can follow us.

84
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,088
What if it's not who you think it is?
It's them. It's Treadstone.

85
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,633
Jason, don't do it.
Look, Marie, I warned 'em.

86
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:34,010
I don't want you to do it.
I told them what would happen if they didn't leave us alone.

87
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,764
It's never gonna be over like this. I don't want...
We don't have a choice.

88
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:39,808
Yes, you do.

89
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,406
Thank you.

90
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,452
Two of these explosive charges placed on
the power lines, and one of them failed.

91
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:06,621
The fingerprints from the
one that didn't go off.

92
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:08,790
<i>And the Germans can't match it?
No. Nobody's got it.</i>

93
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:13,294
<i>We checked out every database we could access.
But we're hooked into Langley now.</i>

94
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:15,672
Run it.
Okay.

95
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:27,016
What the hell's Treadstone?

96
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:32,605
All right. Get me a flight.
We're going to Langley.

97
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:10,013
Two men dead, three million
in cash gone, no Neski files...

98
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,015
<i>And all very public.</i>

99
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:15,185
This is still a clandestine agency, no?

100
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,187
I don't view this event as a failure.

101
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,981
You call it a success?
We have a lead.

102
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:24,027
A fingerprint left by the assassin.
He's one of us.

103
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:29,491
Who is it?
What can you tell me about Treadstone?

104
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:33,495
Treadstone?
It's where the trail dead-ends.

105
00:22:33,578 --> 00:22:36,539
If you want an answer,
you're going to have to give me...

106
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:39,834
A level-five SCI access.

107
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,380
We have a lead, Marty.

108
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,512
All right.
You've got your clearance.

109
00:22:50,595 --> 00:22:54,224
But you're on a very short leash.

110
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:58,353
And you'll give a full report to the group.
I wanna know where you're going with this.

111
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:01,022
Sir.

112
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,934
<i>Ward?</i>

113
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:21,644
Yes?
Pamela Landy.

114
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:24,105
Hey, Pam.
What can I do for you?

115
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:26,691
I was hoping you had some time for me.
Time for what?

116
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:32,071
I'm free right now, actually.
That sounds ominous. Let me check my schedule.

117
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:39,078
<i>Excuse me. I need to, uh...
Excuse me. Can I help you?</i>

118
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:41,456
<i>Yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Abbott.
Twenty minutes?</i>

119
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:44,292
See ya.

120
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:54,511
Operation Treadstone.
Never heard of it.

121
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:59,349
That's not gonna fly. With all due respect, Pam,
I think you might've wandered past your pay grade.

122
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:04,104
That's a warrant from Director Marshall
granting me unrestricted access to...

123
00:25:04,187 --> 00:25:07,148
<i>All personnel and materials
associated with Treadstone.</i>

124
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:13,613
So, what are we looking at?
I wanna know about it.

125
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:16,699
Know about it?
It was a kill squad. Black-On-Black.

126
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:21,287
We closed it down two years ago.
Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.

127
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:24,999
<i>So I think you better take this back to Marty
and let him know exactly what you're doing.</i>

128
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:29,295
He does. I've been down to the
archives. I have the files, Ward.

129
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:33,716
<i>Let's talk about Conklin.
What are you after, Pam?</i>

130
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,345
You wanna fry me?
You want my desk. Is that it?

131
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:39,222
I wanna know what happened.
What happened?

132
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:44,310
Jason Bourne happened. You got the files.
Then let's cut the crap.

133
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:48,356
<i>Conklin had these guys wound so tight,
they were bound to snap.</i>

134
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:53,653
<i>Bourne was his number-one.
The guy went for a job, screwed the op, never came back.</i>

135
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:58,825
<i>Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust.
It all went sideways.</i>

136
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:02,162
So you had Conklin killed?
I mean, if we're cutting the crap.

137
00:26:02,245 --> 00:26:04,706
I've given 30 years and two
marriages to this agency.

138
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,709
I've shoveled shit on four continents.
I'm due to retire next year.

139
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,753
But if you think I'm gonna sit here
and let you dangle me with this...

140
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:14,340
You can go to hell... And Marshall too.

141
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:18,052
<i>It had to be done.</i>

142
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:20,930
<i>And Bourne? Where is he now?
Dead in a ditch.</i>

143
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,725
<i>Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu. Who knows?
I think I do.</i>

144
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:26,269
<i>I had a deal going down
in Berlin last week.</i>

145
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:28,938
<i>During the buy, both our case
officer and the seller were killed.</i>

146
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:32,066
They were killed byJason Bourne.

147
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:37,363
They're ready for us upstairs.

148
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:22,617
Seven years ago, $20 million of CIA funds
disappeared during a wire transfer through Moscow.

149
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,164
In the investigation that followed, we were
contacted by a Russian politician, Vladimir Neski.

150
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:32,210
Neski claimed we had a leak and that
we'd been ripped off by one of our own.

151
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:34,629
And were we?
We never found out.

152
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:37,006
We were negotiating a meet with
Mr. Neski when he was killed.

153
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,050
By who?
His wife.

154
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:41,803
<i>The case had gone cold until a
month ago when we found a source.</i>

155
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:45,431
Another Russian in Berlin who claimed
to have access to the Neski murder files.

156
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:47,642
<i>We thought we had
another bite at the apple.</i>

157
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:55,108
<i>Turns out the assassin was
one of our own... Jason Bourne.</i>

158
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:59,362
<i>I know Treadstone's not a very
popular subject around here...</i>

159
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:01,948
But we found some interesting
things when we dug a little deeper.

160
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:05,452
This is Conklin's personal computer.

161
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:10,957
<i>His Treadstone files are bloated with code keys and
case files that he neither needed nor had clearance for.</i>

162
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,044
Buried in the hard drive, we found a deleted
file with an account number to a bank in Zurich.

163
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:20,842
<i>At the time ofhis death, he was sitting on a
personal account in the amount of $ 760,000.</i>

164
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:25,680
You know what his budget was? We were throwing
money at him and asking him to keep it dark.

165
00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:28,725
It was his own account. He was up to something.
This is supposed to be definitive?

166
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:31,728
<i>What's definitive is that I just lost two people in Berlin.
So what's your theory?</i>

167
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:36,357
Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?
The man is dead.

168
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,694
No one's disputing that, Ward.
For Christ's sake, Marty, you knew Conklin.

169
00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:43,698
Does this scan? I mean, at all?

170
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:45,742
Cut to the chase, Pam.

171
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:48,119
<i>I think that Bourne and Conklin
were in business together...</i>

172
00:28:48,203 --> 00:28:51,372
That Bourne's still involved and that whatever
information I was trying to buy in Berlin...

173
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:54,417
Was big enough to bring Bourne
out from hiding to kill again.

174
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:56,669
How's that scan?

175
00:28:57,629 --> 00:28:59,589
<i>Excuse me, sir, but you're
not gonna believe this.</i>

176
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:02,592
Jason Bourne's passport just
popped up on the grid in Naples.

177
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,724
Okay. Contact Naples.
They need to know who they're dealing with.

178
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:13,561
Find out what kind of local
assets we have in place there.

179
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:21,236
Nah, it's nothing. Some guy's
name came up on the computer.

180
00:29:23,738 --> 00:29:27,575
Yeah. Hey, listen, Tom,
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

181
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:29,911
All right.

182
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:47,762
Mr. Bourne, I'm John Nevins.
I'm with the US Consulate.

183
00:29:47,846 --> 00:29:50,265
I just have a few questions for you.

184
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,236
You're coming out ofTangier.
Is that correct?

185
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:12,912
What's the, uh, nature
of your visit to Naples?

186
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:38,646
Look, I don't know what you did,
and I don't know who you're working for.

187
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:40,648
But I promise you this...

188
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,693
You're gonna play ball
one way or the other.

189
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:54,496
This is Nevins.

190
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:57,791
This is Tom Cronin, CIA Operations Officer
calling from Langley, Virginia.

191
00:30:57,874 --> 00:31:01,294
Do you have a Jason Bourne in custody?
Yes, I do.

192
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:04,047
Listen, he's an agency priority target.

193
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:08,968
Call me back as soon as he's secure.
I understand.

194
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:56,432
He's been detained.
Here's the number.

195
00:31:56,516 --> 00:31:59,519
<i>He's being interrogated by a
field officer out of the consulate.</i>

196
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:16,870
Hello.
This is Pamela Landy, CIA Supervisor.

197
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:19,539
<i>Where do we stand?</i>

198
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:22,417
I, uh, think he got away.

199
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:25,211
Damn it.

200
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:28,923
Have you locked down the area?
Locked it down? No. No.

201
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:32,093
This is, uh... This is Italy.
They don't exactly lock down...

202
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:35,597
How long have you worked for the agency?
Me? For four years.

203
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:40,435
<i>If you ever wanna make it to five, you're gonna listen
to me real close. Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

204
00:32:40,518 --> 00:32:43,813
Last week in Berlin he assassinated two men...
One a highly experienced field officer.

205
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:47,108
I want you to secure that area.
I want any evidence secured, and I want it done right now.

206
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:49,611
Is that clear?
Yes, sir... ma'am.

207
00:32:49,652 --> 00:32:53,072
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes,
which means you're gonna call me back in 30.

208
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:55,742
<i>And when I ask you where we stand,
I had better be impressed.</i>

209
00:33:00,497 --> 00:33:02,665
Berlin?
I already have a team in place there.

210
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:05,335
<i>I doubt that Bourne's in
Naples ready to start a family.</i>

211
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:08,004
<i>You have no idea what you're getting into.
Do you have any idea?</i>

212
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:11,466
<i>From the minute he left Treadstone, he's killed and
eluded every single person that you've sent to find him.</i>

213
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:15,011
You read a couple of files on Jason Bourne, and
that makes you an expert? This is my case, Ward.

214
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:18,765
<i>Enough. I want you both on that plane.</i>

215
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:23,019
<i>We are, all of us, going to do what we were either
too lazy or inept to do the last time around.</i>

216
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:26,272
We're gonna find this son
of a bitch and take him down.

217
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:29,943
I'm not having Jason Bourne
destroy any more of this agency.

218
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:33,947
Is that definitive enough for you?
Yes.

219
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:40,662
<i>Jason Bourne is armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

220
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:44,499
<i>Last week in Berlin he assassinated two men...
one a highly experienced field officer.</i>

221
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,251
I want that area...

222
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:49,003
<i>He assassinated two men...
one a highly experienced field officer.</i>

223
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:52,715
<i>I want that area secured.
I want any evidence secured, and I want it done right now...</i>

224
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:14,279
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

225
00:34:18,283 --> 00:34:21,786
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.
This is not a drill, soldier.</i>

226
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,707
<i>We clear on that?
We clear on that?</i>

227
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:41,991
<i>You'd been working at
Treadstone for three years...</i>

228
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:43,993
<i>And your cover at the time was what?</i>

229
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:46,788
That I was an American student in Paris.

230
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,791
And what exactly did your job with
Treadstone in Paris consist of?

231
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:53,586
<i>I had two responsibilities.
One was to coordinate logistical operations.</i>

232
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,797
The other was to monitor
the health of the agents.

233
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,341
<i>Health, meaning what?
Their mental health.</i>

234
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:01,344
Because of what they had been through, they
were prone to a variety of problems. What kind?

235
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:05,431
Depression, anger, compulsive behaviors.

236
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:09,436
They had physical symptoms.
Headaches, sensitivity to light.

237
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,813
Amnesia?
Before Bourne? No.

238
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:20,238
The plane's ready.
There's a car waiting for you.

239
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:22,282
Good luck.
No. You were his local contact.

240
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:25,952
You were with him the night Conklin died.
You're coming with us.

241
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:33,269
Langley pulled an image out of Naples.
It's uploading right now.

242
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:35,105
It's coming in now.

243
00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:39,067
<i>I need clearance.
He's not hiding, that's for sure.</i>

244
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:41,569
Why Naples? Why now?
Could be random.

245
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:43,738
Maybe he's running.
On his own passport?

246
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,449
What is he actually doing?
He's making his first mistake.

247
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,243
It's not a mistake.

248
00:37:49,494 --> 00:37:52,831
They don't make mistakes.
They don't do random.

249
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:55,375
There's always an objective.
Always a target.

250
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:57,961
<i>The objective and targets always came from us.
Who's giving them to him now?</i>

251
00:37:58,044 --> 00:38:00,380
Scary version?

252
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:02,757
He is.

253
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:05,612
I emptied it.
It felt a little light.

254
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:07,363
Put it down.

255
00:39:12,702 --> 00:39:17,665
Front.
Sorry. Old habits.

256
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:22,670
Use your teeth.
Ah.

257
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:36,267
Word in the ether was
you'd lost your memory.

258
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:38,311
You still should've moved.

259
00:39:41,356 --> 00:39:44,192
What do you want?
Conklin.

260
00:39:44,234 --> 00:39:46,194
He's dead.

261
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:50,990
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
So who's running Treadstone now?

262
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:54,661
Nobody. They shut it down.

263
00:39:54,744 --> 00:39:58,748
It's over. We're the last two.

264
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:05,839
If it's over, then why
are they still after me?

265
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:08,550
I don't know.
Ever heard the name Pamela Landy?

266
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:11,845
I don't know who that is.
Pamela Landy and Berlin. What's going on in Berlin?

267
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:14,722
<i>I don't know.</i>

268
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:17,308
Why would I lie?

269
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:43,042
I thought you were here to kill me.

270
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:49,799
What'd you do?
I'm sorry.

271
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:51,968
Did you call it in?

272
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:57,974
Get up. Come on.

273
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:04,481
You have a car out front?
The keys are in my coat pocket.

274
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:06,483
But we should...
What?

275
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:08,943
<i>Go out the back.
I have another car.</i>

276
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,011
Pamela Landy.

277
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,725
<i>Nein, mein Herr.
Danke.</i>

278
00:45:56,481 --> 00:46:00,193
Pamela Landy.

279
00:46:00,276 --> 00:46:02,570
<i>Nein.</i>

280
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:12,539
<i>Pamela Landy, bitte.</i>

281
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,252
<i>Ja.</i>

282
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:52,078
Pamela Landy, please.
One moment, please.

283
00:46:52,162 --> 00:46:55,790
Thank you.

284
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:58,877
I wanted to call a guest.
Pamela Landy.

285
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,838
<i>Just one second, please.</i>

286
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:05,091
Hello?

287
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,179
Hello?

288
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:13,975
I'm sorry, sir. The phone's busy right now.
Just try later. Thank you.

289
00:48:01,397 --> 00:48:04,818
<i>Okay. Let's take a look at the timeline.
What's Bourne's objective?</i>

290
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:07,529
<i>Now, I wanna break this out in boxes.</i>

291
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:11,533
<i>Naples outbound. Check everything.
Flights, trains, police reports. That's box one.</i>

292
00:48:11,574 --> 00:48:13,368
Teddy, that's yours.
Got it.

293
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:19,040
<i>Box number two.
Call it "prior connections."</i>

294
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:21,835
I want to rerun all Bourne's
Treadstone material. Every footstep.

295
00:48:24,462 --> 00:48:27,215
<i>Kim, box three.
I want to identify his method of travel.</i>

296
00:48:27,298 --> 00:48:29,843
<i>Stay on the local cops.
We need a vehicle, a parking ticket, something.</i>

297
00:48:29,926 --> 00:48:34,514
Langley's offered to upload any satellite
imaging we need, so let's find a target for them.

298
00:48:37,016 --> 00:48:41,229
<i>Danny, box four. I need fresh eyes.
Review the buy where we lost the Neski files.</i>

299
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:45,942
Timeline it with what we know about Bourne's movements.
Turn it upside down and see what we find.

300
00:48:48,278 --> 00:48:53,032
<i>Come on, guys. We ran this guy's life with total control
for all those years. We should be a step ahead ofhim.</i>

301
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:55,743
You wanna go home?
Find Jason Bourne.

302
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:19,559
Pamela Landy.
This is Jason Bourne.

303
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:24,147
<i>Bourne?
It's Bourne. We need 90 seconds to triangulate his position.</i>

304
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,608
What do you want?

305
00:49:28,818 --> 00:49:31,446
Are you running Treadstone?

306
00:49:34,657 --> 00:49:37,786
Treadstone was closed down
two years ago. You know that.

307
00:49:37,827 --> 00:49:40,413
Then who's planning the missions now?

308
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:43,875
There are no missions. It's over.

309
00:49:45,502 --> 00:49:48,797
Then what do you want with me?
Berlin.

310
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:54,135
Have you forgotten
what happened in Berlin?

311
00:49:55,512 --> 00:49:58,848
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.
You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

312
00:49:58,932 --> 00:50:01,601
<i>You killed two people, Bourne.</i>

313
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:07,774
<i>Neski... Vladimir Neski...
Vladimir Neski...</i>

314
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,326
Bourne?

315
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:22,831
<i>I wanna come in.</i>

316
00:50:24,624 --> 00:50:29,045
<i>Okay. How do you wanna do it?
We need 35 seconds.</i>

317
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:33,842
I need someone I know to bring me in.
Who?

318
00:50:33,925 --> 00:50:36,886
<i>There was a girl in Paris.
She was part of the program.</i>

319
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:42,308
<i>She used to handle logistics.
Alexander Strasse, 30 minutes, under the World Clock.</i>

320
00:50:42,392 --> 00:50:45,562
<i>Send her alone.
Give her your phone.</i>

321
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:48,189
What if I can't find her?

322
00:50:48,273 --> 00:50:51,401
It's easy.
She's standing right next to you.

323
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:08,001
There's just so many areas...
It's a very simple layout.

324
00:51:09,085 --> 00:51:10,920
<i>Get the second quadrant.
Pull it out.</i>

325
00:51:11,004 --> 00:51:14,424
<i>Where is it?
Get the second quadrant, please. Pull it all the way up.</i>

326
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:17,260
<i>Clock is right here...
Shit, he's put her in the middle of everything.</i>

327
00:51:17,343 --> 00:51:20,263
This is a security nightmare.
There is no way we are going to get her covered...

328
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:24,225
Call a Mayday into Berlin station.
We need snipers, DOD, whatever they've got.

329
00:51:24,267 --> 00:51:28,396
No snipers. You put snipers on the roof and it'll scare him off,
and I need answers.

330
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,692
You can't really believe he wants to come in.
He knows something about the Neski case.

331
00:51:32,776 --> 00:51:36,571
I'm not gonna pass up this chance to find out what it is.
Don't be a fool. Not when we're this close.

332
00:51:36,613 --> 00:51:38,782
Are we talking about protecting
Nicky or killing Bourne?

333
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:39,992
We're talking about killing Bourne.

334
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:42,912
We're talking about the next dead body.
It might be Nicky. It will be someone.

335
00:51:42,953 --> 00:51:46,289
You're not hearing me.
Bourne dead gives me nothing.

336
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:52,420
Can I talk to you privately?

337
00:51:57,759 --> 00:52:00,428
What?
I know how you're feeling.

338
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,097
You lost two men in Berlin and
you want it to mean something.

339
00:52:03,181 --> 00:52:05,183
But nothing Bourne gives
you will bring your men back.

340
00:52:05,266 --> 00:52:09,646
Nothing in those files makes their sacrifice worthwhile.
You have to let go.

341
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:13,316
We're professionals.
When an operation goes bad, we tie it off.

342
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:17,570
If there's something you're not telling me, I want it
now before I send that girl out there. Do you understand?

343
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:23,868
You talk about this stuff
like you read it in a book.

344
00:52:38,174 --> 00:52:40,260
What do you want to do?

345
00:52:41,344 --> 00:52:43,972
Put the snipers in place.

346
00:52:44,055 --> 00:52:47,225
If things go bad, we take him out.

347
00:52:47,308 --> 00:52:49,102
You got it.

348
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:31,770
Hub, this is Survey One.
We have a crowd moving in.

349
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:36,065
<i>It's some sort of protest march.
I'm sorry. This is as close as I can get.</i>

350
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:40,069
<i>Survey Two, can you get in any closer?
Kurt, make sure the south end is covered.</i>

351
00:53:40,153 --> 00:53:43,114
<i>Roger. Affirmative. Copy that.</i>

352
00:53:57,253 --> 00:54:01,841
Hello.
There's a tram coming towards you. Get on it.

353
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:04,761
She's moving to the tram.
Where's it going?

354
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:07,931
<i>The tram is going to
Alexanderplatz Station.</i>

355
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:16,439
<i>Survey Five, I can't see him.
I don't see him.</i>

356
00:54:20,443 --> 00:54:22,987
<i>Hub, this is Survey Two,
she's getting on a tram.</i>

357
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:25,115
She's getting on the tram.
Zoom in on the tram.

358
00:54:25,198 --> 00:54:27,867
<i>Bourne's on the tram.
I don't think he's on the tram.</i>

359
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:30,328
<i>He's on the tram.</i>

360
00:54:32,205 --> 00:54:35,583
Send them in to follow.
Tell them to keep their distance.

361
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:37,627
<i>Okay, Delta, let's go.
Get on it.</i>

362
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,005
Come on. Let's go.

363
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:44,717
<i>Tell her to hurry.</i>

364
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:03,486
Alexanderplatz Station, 25 seconds.

365
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:22,338
<i>This is Survey Three. There's a lot of protesters here.
There's no way we can cover out there.</i>

366
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,135
Get her out of there.
Go! Delta, move! Now!

367
00:55:44,903 --> 00:55:48,823
<i>She's not here. She's gone.
Goddamn it!</i>

368
00:55:48,907 --> 00:55:51,117
<i>They are not on the tram.
He's one guy!</i>

369
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:54,496
<i>Jason, please don't hurt me.
What were my words?</i>

370
00:55:54,579 --> 00:55:57,123
I said leave me alone,
leave me out of it.

371
00:55:57,207 --> 00:56:00,710
I did. I swear.
Jason, I told them that I believed you.

372
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:03,129
I'm gonna ask you some
some simple questions.

373
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:07,008
You're gonna answer me honestly,
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you.

374
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:09,719
Delta, give me something.
They're on it! They're on it!

375
00:56:09,803 --> 00:56:12,055
Who's Pamela Landy?

376
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:15,558
<i>She's a task force chief.
Is she running Treadstone?</i>

377
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:18,394
No, she's the deputy director.
Why is she trying to kill me?

378
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:22,482
<i>Last week an agency field officer tried
to make a buy off of one ofher ops.</i>

379
00:56:22,565 --> 00:56:26,236
He was trying to sell out a mole or
something and you got to him before we did.

380
00:56:26,277 --> 00:56:28,404
<i>I killed him?
You left a print.</i>

381
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:31,491
<i>There were partial prints that trace back to Treadstone.
They know it was you.</i>

382
00:56:31,574 --> 00:56:35,245
<i>That is insane.
Why are you doing this? Why come back now?</i>

383
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:37,872
Landy will find...
Stop. Stop.

384
00:56:37,956 --> 00:56:42,168
Last week I was 4,000 miles away
in India, watching Marie die.

385
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:45,130
<i>They came for me,
and they killed her instead.</i>

386
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:47,215
<i>This ends now.</i>

387
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:55,348
<i>Find her.</i>

388
00:56:55,431 --> 00:56:59,394
What do you people want with me?
Why are you trying to frame me?

389
00:56:59,477 --> 00:57:03,231
Please! I'm only here because of Paris. Abbott dragged us...
Abbott? Who's Abbott?

390
00:57:03,314 --> 00:57:05,275
Conklin's boss.
He-He shut down Treadstone.

391
00:57:05,316 --> 00:57:07,110
Is he here in Berlin?
Yes.

392
00:57:07,193 --> 00:57:09,154
Did he run Treadstone?

393
00:57:09,195 --> 00:57:12,282
Did he run Treadstone?
Yes. Conklin reported to him.

394
00:57:12,323 --> 00:57:14,284
Please. Please, I swear...

395
00:57:14,325 --> 00:57:18,413
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?
Conklin... Stuff on Conklin.

396
00:57:18,496 --> 00:57:21,416
It was something to do
with a Russian politician.

397
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:30,925
Neski.
Wh-What? What are you talking about?

398
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,722
<i>Training is over... Training is over...
Training is over...</i>

399
00:57:35,805 --> 00:57:38,308
When... When was I here in Berlin?

400
00:57:38,391 --> 00:57:41,311
What are you talking about?
For Treadstone. I did a job here.

401
00:57:41,352 --> 00:57:44,272
When?
No, you never worked in Berlin before.

402
00:57:44,355 --> 00:57:46,691
My first job. In Berlin.
You know my file.

403
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:49,611
You've never worked Berlin before.
My first job!

404
00:57:49,694 --> 00:57:52,322
No, your first assignment was Geneva.
You fucking people!

405
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:55,575
I swear! I swear!
I know I was here, Nicky!

406
00:57:55,658 --> 00:57:58,745
It's not in your file!
I know I was here!

407
00:57:58,828 --> 00:58:01,664
<i>No, I swear... Oh, please!</i>

408
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,019
Pam, I want to show you something.
It's Alexanderplatz.

409
00:58:23,061 --> 00:58:26,940
<i>We got three levels, we got 15 tunnels.
They're all converging in a five-block radius.</i>

410
00:58:27,023 --> 00:58:29,025
Over here, Luftschulzbunker.
That was an old war shelter.

411
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:32,487
How many men are out there? Two coming down the back stairs.
The rest, they're fanned out for a search.

412
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,323
<i>What's our security situation here?
Where, "here"? The ground?</i>

413
00:58:35,406 --> 00:58:39,369
<i>Here here. In the building. Check everything, and recheck
all the stairwells, hallways, everything.</i>

414
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:41,871
It's done.

415
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:46,376
<i>Okay, let's go public.
Release his photo to the Berlin police.</i>

416
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:49,796
And check out his story about the girlfriend in India too.
I'm on it.

417
00:58:49,879 --> 00:58:53,550
You're in a big puddle of shit, Pamela,
and you don't have the shoes for it.

418
00:58:54,759 --> 00:58:57,720
He said he didn't know anything about Berlin.
He knew that Nicky was wearing a wire.

419
00:58:57,762 --> 00:59:01,641
Don't you think that was for our benefit?
He didn't sound like a man in control to me.

420
00:59:01,724 --> 00:59:04,018
<i>We know he was in Berlin.</i>

421
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:06,396
His mind is broken.
We broke it. And now...

422
00:59:06,438 --> 00:59:09,482
What now? Terminate him?
You've been pushing that agenda ever since we got here.

423
00:59:09,566 --> 00:59:13,069
He also said you were running Treadstone. Should we believe that too?
I'm convinced Bourne knows something.

424
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:15,155
He knows that you're after him...

425
00:59:15,238 --> 00:59:19,492
And in the interest of self-preservation
you might start with that.

426
00:59:19,576 --> 00:59:22,245
Check on those photos.
Have they gone out?

427
00:59:35,467 --> 00:59:37,427
I need to show you something.

428
01:01:23,575 --> 01:01:27,537
All right, I finished my box work,
but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy.

429
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,581
Came down here last night...

430
01:01:29,622 --> 01:01:31,583
Because none of this
is making any sense.

431
01:01:31,624 --> 01:01:34,085
I'm with you... Conklin was a nut.
But a traitor?

432
01:01:34,127 --> 01:01:37,881
I just can't get there.
What do you have, Danny?

433
01:01:37,964 --> 01:01:41,384
All right, you put a four-gam Kel on here,
it's gonna take out power to the building.

434
01:01:41,426 --> 01:01:43,636
You know that.

435
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,725
There were two charges that were supposed to go off simultaneously.
The second one, over here, didn't go off.

436
01:01:48,808 --> 01:01:52,771
Now, first of all, this is nothing.
It's a sub-line for the breaker above.

437
01:01:52,812 --> 01:01:55,273
And second, why put the
charge all the way down here?

438
01:01:55,315 --> 01:02:00,028
If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear,
you're good enough to know you don't need this.

439
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:02,030
Bourne would know.

440
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:04,616
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No.

441
01:02:04,699 --> 01:02:08,620
But what if somebody were trying to cover
their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne?

442
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:11,664
What if Bourne didn't have
anything to do with this?

443
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,920
Show me again.
All right.

444
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:19,088
Well, you put...

445
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,199
<i>Pull over. He's getting out.</i>

446
01:02:49,244 --> 01:02:53,581
<i>This is not a drill, soldier.
We clear on that?</i>

447
01:02:53,665 --> 01:02:57,460
This is a live project,
and you're a go.

448
01:03:00,004 --> 01:03:02,966
<i>I'll see you on the other side.</i>

449
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,571
Good evening, sir. How can I help you?
I want to get a room for the night.

450
01:03:24,654 --> 01:03:27,657
Do you have a reservation?
No.

451
01:03:32,745 --> 01:03:37,125
Actually, is room 645 available?
I've stayed there before.

452
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:44,924
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
That room is occupied. How about room 644?</i>

453
01:03:45,008 --> 01:03:47,510
<i>It's right across the hall.</i>

454
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:49,554
<i>Sir?</i>

455
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:53,850
644?
That's fine. Thank you.

456
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:57,979
I just need your passport and
signature right here, please.

457
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:01,441
Have a nice night.

458
01:04:34,057 --> 01:04:35,725
<i>Ja.</i>

459
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,879
<i>Berlin Polizei.</i>

460
01:05:20,937 --> 01:05:23,398
Where?
Brecker Hotel.

461
01:05:23,481 --> 01:05:25,358
Okay, we're there.
Take the van!

462
01:05:25,442 --> 01:05:27,694
Brecker? How far?
About five or six minutes.

463
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:11,029
Hey!

464
01:06:47,357 --> 01:06:50,235
<i>Congratulations, soldier.</i>

465
01:06:50,276 --> 01:06:52,654
Training is over.

466
01:07:34,112 --> 01:07:37,073
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

467
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:54,174
Go!

468
01:08:19,824 --> 01:08:24,704
Black coat, possibly leather,
dark T-Shirt, dark pants.

469
01:08:24,788 --> 01:08:29,000
The cops out there wanna corral all the
guests together and check 'em out one by one.

470
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,294
That will really work.

471
01:08:31,336 --> 01:08:34,380
What the hell's he doing here?
Maybe he just wanted to stay the night.

472
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,418
<i>Polizei!</i>

473
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:25,932
Polizei! Polizei!

474
01:09:31,354 --> 01:09:34,274
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

475
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:17,233
<i>Polizei! Polizei!</i>

476
01:12:14,058 --> 01:12:15,977
They missed him?
Yeah, so far.

477
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,980
But they found Nicky.
She's back at the Westin. Bourne let her go.

478
01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:20,815
He let her go?
Yeah.

479
01:12:22,317 --> 01:12:26,237
Where's Danny Zorn?
He ought to head over there and debrief her.

480
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:28,239
Why did Bourne come here?

481
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:31,534
We don't know yet.
Landy's upstairs in one of the rooms.

482
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:34,078
<i>She said she'd call you when she's done.</i>

483
01:12:36,748 --> 01:12:38,708
Okay.

484
01:12:40,126 --> 01:12:44,839
I think I'll, uh...
Take a cab back to the hotel.

485
01:12:49,928 --> 01:12:52,555
<i>So, the room he checked
into was across the hall.</i>

486
01:12:52,597 --> 01:12:54,557
Mmm.

487
01:12:54,599 --> 01:12:56,851
Why would he come in here?

488
01:13:05,151 --> 01:13:08,530
What are you thinking?
I recognize this room from a photo.

489
01:13:10,115 --> 01:13:13,493
There was a chalk outline right here
around the body of Vladimir Neski.

490
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:17,747
This is where his wife killed him?

491
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:20,166
Do you still think his wife killed him?

492
01:13:29,092 --> 01:13:31,261
Guess he got out through this window.

493
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:35,723
We just got word from the Berlin police.

494
01:13:35,807 --> 01:13:37,600
They found Danny Zorn's body.

495
01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:46,693
I want you two to stay on Bourne.
Check everything that's out there.

496
01:13:46,776 --> 01:13:49,279
Call Abbott.
Tell him to wait for me in his hotel.

497
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,489
I'm coming to see him.

498
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:22,645
<i>Da.
It's me.</i>

499
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,731
They're onto Neski.

500
01:14:26,024 --> 01:14:28,985
This is not a clean phone.
They can't prove anything without Bourne.

501
01:14:29,027 --> 01:14:31,946
Kill Bourne, and you
kill this investigation.

502
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:36,451
I'm afraid, Ward, the time has
come for us to part company.

503
01:14:36,534 --> 01:14:41,122
Listen, Yuri, you bought those oil leases
with 20 million in stolen CIA seed money.

504
01:14:41,206 --> 01:14:43,583
You owe me.
I gave you your cut.

505
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:45,835
We both got rich.

506
01:14:45,877 --> 01:14:48,004
I don't owe you anything.

507
01:14:48,046 --> 01:14:51,633
The plan can still be salvaged.
Just get Bourne. You hear me?

508
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:53,635
He's still out there.
Now get him.

509
01:14:53,718 --> 01:14:55,261
Get Jason...

510
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:18,493
I don't suppose it would do me
much good to cry for help, huh?

511
01:15:20,495 --> 01:15:22,497
Not much.

512
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:26,334
You killed her.

513
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:28,336
It was a mistake.

514
01:15:28,419 --> 01:15:31,214
It was supposed to be you.

515
01:15:31,256 --> 01:15:35,218
There were files linking
me to the Neski murder.

516
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:39,222
If the files disappeared
and they suspected you...

517
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:41,391
They'd be chasing a ghost for 10 years.

518
01:15:41,432 --> 01:15:43,393
So we got in the way.

519
01:15:43,435 --> 01:15:46,813
Is that why Neski died?
Is that why you killed Marie?

520
01:15:46,896 --> 01:15:48,815
You killed Marie...

521
01:15:48,898 --> 01:15:50,817
The minute you climbed into her car.

522
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,820
The minute you entered her life,
she was dead.

523
01:15:53,903 --> 01:15:56,823
I told you people to leave us alone.

524
01:15:56,906 --> 01:15:59,325
I fell off the grid.
I was halfway around the world.

525
01:15:59,409 --> 01:16:02,287
<i>There's no place it
won't catch up to you.</i>

526
01:16:02,328 --> 01:16:04,789
It's how every story ends.

527
01:16:04,831 --> 01:16:08,042
It's what you are, Jason...
A killer.

528
01:16:08,126 --> 01:16:10,545
<i>You always will be.</i>

529
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,717
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!</i>

530
01:16:17,886 --> 01:16:20,346
She wouldn't want me to.

531
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,474
That's the only reason you're alive.

532
01:17:38,424 --> 01:17:41,678
I'm a patriot.
I serve my country.

533
01:17:41,761 --> 01:17:45,014
And Danny Zorn? What was he?
Unlucky.

534
01:17:46,891 --> 01:17:48,852
Collateral damage.

535
01:17:51,688 --> 01:17:53,690
So, what do we do now?

536
01:17:55,024 --> 01:17:56,776
I'm not sorry.

537
01:18:56,461 --> 01:18:59,047
<i>No, no, no, forget it.
Call me as soon as he's here.</i>

538
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:01,049
No, that's nothing.

539
01:19:01,132 --> 01:19:03,510
<i>Good synch-up.
Who's this guy?</i>

540
01:19:03,593 --> 01:19:05,762
<i>Platform "B."</i>

541
01:19:05,845 --> 01:19:08,932
<i>Go ahead. Go on. Go on!
Do it! Do it!</i>

542
01:19:09,015 --> 01:19:11,559
<i>She wouldn't want me to.</i>

543
01:19:11,643 --> 01:19:14,229
That's the only reason you're alive.

544
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:27,534
Got a call from Langley.

545
01:19:27,617 --> 01:19:30,537
<i>They're, uh, going
through Abbott's records...</i>

546
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,790
<i>And Marshall wants to know
what's going on with Bourne.</i>

547
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:39,129
<i>Wait, Teddy. Teddy, who's this?
Look at this guy.</i>

548
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,297
<i>He's about to enter...
Right there! There!</i>

549
01:19:41,339 --> 01:19:43,633
<i>Right through there.
That's Bourne.</i>

550
01:19:43,675 --> 01:19:46,803
<i>Get down here! We got something!
We got a sighting! Check it out!</i>

551
01:19:46,845 --> 01:19:49,806
There. I got it on the big monitor.
Hold on.

552
01:19:49,848 --> 01:19:52,475
Here it comes again.

553
01:19:52,517 --> 01:19:55,270
<i>Whoa, whoa. Hold on. He's just entered frame.
It's the coat. That's him!</i>

554
01:19:55,353 --> 01:19:57,939
What train is that?

555
01:19:58,022 --> 01:20:01,568
That's the train to Moscow.
Why the hell would he go to Moscow?

556
01:20:03,653 --> 01:20:07,115
Get me the Russian interior ministry.

557
01:23:33,613 --> 01:23:36,866
<i>Da.</i>

558
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,760
<i>Da.</i>

559
01:36:31,891 --> 01:36:34,644
I speak English.

560
01:36:34,686 --> 01:36:36,688
I'm not gonna hurt you.

561
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,442
I won't hurt you.

562
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:50,160
You're older.

563
01:36:54,205 --> 01:36:56,166
Older than I thought you'd be.

564
01:37:00,295 --> 01:37:02,213
That picture.

565
01:37:04,924 --> 01:37:07,677
<i>Does that mean a lot to you?</i>

566
01:37:09,596 --> 01:37:12,640
It's nothing.
It's just a picture.

567
01:37:12,724 --> 01:37:14,684
No.

568
01:37:15,935 --> 01:37:18,897
It's 'cause you don't
know how they died.

569
01:37:18,938 --> 01:37:20,940
I do.

570
01:37:22,192 --> 01:37:24,152
No, you don't.

571
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:31,659
I would want to know.

572
01:37:36,372 --> 01:37:41,211
I would want to know that my...
That my mother didn't kill my father...

573
01:37:42,462 --> 01:37:44,422
That she didn't kill herself.

574
01:37:44,464 --> 01:37:46,466
What?

575
01:37:48,802 --> 01:37:52,388
It's not what happened to your parents.

576
01:37:59,104 --> 01:38:01,106
I killed them.

577
01:38:04,484 --> 01:38:06,569
I killed them.

578
01:38:08,655 --> 01:38:10,824
It was my job.

579
01:38:13,243 --> 01:38:15,578
It was my first time.

580
01:38:19,999 --> 01:38:23,503
Your father was supposed to be alone.

581
01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:29,926
But then your mother...

582
01:38:32,178 --> 01:38:34,180
<i>Came out of nowhere...</i>

583
01:38:38,184 --> 01:38:40,687
<i>And I had to change my plan.</i>

584
01:38:46,484 --> 01:38:49,070
It changes things...

585
01:38:49,154 --> 01:38:51,072
That knowledge.

586
01:38:51,156 --> 01:38:53,116
Doesn't it?

587
01:38:58,496 --> 01:39:01,624
When what you love
gets taken from you...

588
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:07,672
You wanna know the truth.

589
01:39:27,192 --> 01:39:29,152
I'm sorry.

590
01:40:27,252 --> 01:40:30,713
Pamela Landy.
I hear you're still looking for me.

591
01:40:35,176 --> 01:40:37,220
Bourne?
What do you want?

592
01:40:40,932 --> 01:40:43,852
I wanted to thank you...

593
01:40:43,935 --> 01:40:46,062
For the tape.

594
01:40:46,104 --> 01:40:50,567
<i>We got what we needed.
It's all tied off. It's over.</i>

595
01:40:51,901 --> 01:40:53,987
I guess I owe you an apology.

596
01:40:55,113 --> 01:40:57,282
Is that official?

597
01:40:57,365 --> 01:41:00,994
<i>No. Off the record.
You know how it is.</i>

598
01:41:01,077 --> 01:41:02,912
Good-bye.

599
01:41:02,996 --> 01:41:05,582
Wait. Wait.

600
01:41:09,794 --> 01:41:11,754
David Webb.

601
01:41:11,796 --> 01:41:13,756
That's your real name.

602
01:41:13,798 --> 01:41:18,470
<i>You were born 4-15-71
in Nixa, Missouri.</i>

603
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:22,682
<i>Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it.</i>

604
01:41:26,227 --> 01:41:28,229
Bourne?

605
01:41:31,483 --> 01:41:34,444
Get some rest, Pam.
You look tired.
