00:00:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Another Perfectly Synced subtitle
for YIFY Releases by Sahos

2
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,465
All right, I'm going to spray
some rose water, okay?

3
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,133
Take a deep breath.

4
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,849
Okay, take your time getting up.

5
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:39,309
I'll be outside
with some water, okay?

6
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:40,894
Thank you.

7
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,812
Um, Abby?

8
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:45,899
Will you marry me?

9
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,092
The upstairs toilet
is acting funny.

10
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,677
What?

11
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,889
Upstairs toilet is acting funny.

12
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,390
Mm.

13
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,894
Have you noticed?

14
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,396
No, I guess I haven't
really noticed.

15
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,156
It was making
a running sound,

16
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,492
like, even--

17
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:38,827
even when it wasn't...

18
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,579
- Okay.
- ...just when it was not in use.

19
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,832
And then it would stop.

20
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:47,210
Okay, well, did you look
in the back?

21
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:49,462
Like, did you look
in the tank of the toilet?

22
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,422
Mm-mm.

23
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,721
Sometimes the chain
just falls off.

24
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,933
And you just reattach it.

25
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:05,645
Is there-- is there
anything that--

26
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:09,065
No, no, everything is--

27
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:10,441
everything's under control.

28
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,277
Okay, then.

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,494
I'll get it.

30
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,625
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey.

31
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,336
Good to see you.

32
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:34,883
Yeah, I beat my record
by, like, two minutes.

33
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,843
- Oh.
- Uh...

34
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,761
Aw, man.

35
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,016
Is everybody in the kitchen?

36
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,771
Are you out of your mind?

37
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,274
A calzone is not the same
as a Hot Pocket.

38
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,734
Okay, what's the difference, then?

39
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,944
- There's a huge difference.
- Okay, what's the difference?

40
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,571
Okay, you've got
your tomato-based filling

41
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,032
and you've got your
pastry-based outer shell.

42
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,492
Hold on, have you ever
even had a calzone?

43
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,744
Yes, I've had a calzone.

44
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:06,456
I got a pizza and I flipped it over
and I called it a calzone.

45
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:09,250
You know what we're gonna do?
I am going to make you a calzone.

46
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,461
- Okay.
- And you're gonna eat it

47
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:14,631
and then I'm gonna prove you wrong
and you're gonna owe me.

48
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,633
Okay, deal.

49
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:18,635
What do you owe me?

50
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:19,969
- I don't know.
- What's he gonna owe me?

51
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,429
What should I owe her?

52
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:23,473
I don't know.

53
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,893
How about--
how about a beer?

54
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,146
Okay.

55
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,314
I'll get it.

56
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,276
And if it turns out to be
like a DiGiorno's Pizza

57
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,278
that's just folded over
and thrown in the oven,

58
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,446
what do I get out of it?

59
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,114
Well, I mean, regardless,
you're gonna get

60
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,116
a delicious homemade treat, so...

61
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,826
- What? The calzone?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,870
- That's the treat?
- That's the treat.

63
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,331
Oh, God. Okay.
And what happens if I don't like it?

64
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,832
Then what do I get out of it?

65
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,042
Nothing.

66
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,961
That's just--
that's just not possible.

67
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,128
A homemade treat.

68
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,713
Time's up!

69
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,007
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

70
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,093
Mmm!

71
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,637
- Mmm, that smells good.
- Brought wine.

72
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,389
- Hi, baby.
- Just put it here.

73
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,308
I remembered
the salad dressing.

74
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,936
Why didn't you make the one
that you make?

75
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:12,063
- The one--
- I didn't have any time.

76
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,314
The one that you make is so good.

77
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,149
Just tell me next time
and I'll make it.

78
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,901
Well, then you would know
my secret recipe.

79
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,987
Oh, oh, I didn't realize.

80
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,280
Mmm, the stew smells amazing.
What is that?

81
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,450
- Is it cinnamon?
- Will you take this?

82
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:27,120
- What is that?
- Beef. Beef stew.

83
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,205
I know, but what's that smell?
Clove?

84
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,958
It's just beef.

85
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,254
So, did you get them in?

86
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,089
The applications?

87
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,174
I didn't send them.

88
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,926
Are you serious?

89
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,554
Yeah, I'm serious.

90
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,472
What the fuck? Why?

91
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,224
What the fuck?
Give me a break.

92
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,351
What do you mean,
give you a break?

93
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,895
Why didn't you send them?

94
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,481
It's, like, a really bad time.

95
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:58,026
- It's a great time.
- No, it's not a great time.

96
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,194
Why?

97
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,864
We can barely pay Susan, okay.

98
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,532
What does that mean?

99
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:05,783
What do you mean,
what does it mean?

100
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,577
It means that we haven't
had a new client

101
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,496
in forever and all of Grandpa's
clients are dying off.

102
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,165
Yeah, and that's not your problem.

103
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,167
Yeah, well, that's really easy
for you to say.

104
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,085
Yeah, it is easy for me to say.

105
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:18,254
And it's easy for you to say, too.

106
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,465
You don't get it.

107
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,175
Look, I love you.

108
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,093
It's your life.

109
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,179
It's your life.

110
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,390
I have to go to the bathroom.

111
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,185
Should I cook these tomatoes
or does it matter?

112
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,145
Doesn't matter.

113
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:39,067
Dad, will you get the corn bread?

114
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,581
- Hey.
- Hey.

115
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,709
Mmm.

116
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,839
Do you think this is
such a hot idea?

117
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,716
Yeah. I think
it's an incredibly hot idea.

118
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,135
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,001
You look wan.

120
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,463
- Wan?
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,965
Are you sleeping?
You've got bags.

122
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,759
- You're all puffy.
- Yeah, I'm sleeping.

123
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,219
I think he looks okay.

124
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,263
I should have Bronwyn
make an elixir for him.

125
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,430
Mm-hmm.

126
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,724
I have a friend who makes
these incredible energy tonics

127
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,476
that stimulate everything--

128
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,270
your liver, your gallbladder,
your kidneys--

129
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,898
I don't think that elixirs
are Dad's thing.

130
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,316
Well, maybe not--

131
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,152
What does it taste like?

132
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,736
- It tastes like shit.
- Garbage.

133
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,196
But so good for you.

134
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:09,282
Cleansing, healing.

135
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,118
Bronwyn's amazing.

136
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,828
She did Reiki on me last month.
It was incredible.

137
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,663
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,374
You should get Reiki done.

139
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,085
- Paul, you would love Reiki.
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,964
What's Reiki?
What-- what is it?

141
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,301
- It's energy work, essentially.
- Energy work.

142
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,096
Helps you release emotional blockages
and clear out pathways

143
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:37,185
and just makes you feel
awesome in general.

144
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,938
Okay.

145
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,400
Paul, how's the practice doing?

146
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,361
- Great.
- Yeah?

147
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,238
Mm-hmm.

148
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,948
Business is booming?

149
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:54,076
Yeah, we're trucking along and...

150
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:58,581
Good, awesome.

151
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:02,084
How's the apartment search going?

152
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,461
- Did--
- Good.

153
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,171
- It's--
- You found something?

154
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,840
Not yet, but I have a few leads.

155
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,634
You have to be out by the first.

156
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,427
I know, I know, I know.

157
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:14,388
Well, why don't you
just move in with me?

158
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,479
I mean, you're at my house
every night.

159
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,689
- Well, it's not every night.
- Just about every night.

160
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,567
I mean, rent's really high
right now, you know.

161
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,611
I mean, it just makes sense.

162
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:31,697
Or...

163
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:36,869
you could move in here until...

164
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,748
you find a place that's suitable.

165
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,751
There's plenty of room.

166
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,545
The door is always open to you.

167
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,382
Thank you, brother.

168
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,425
That is a very generous offer, Paul.

169
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,594
- Um...
- Thank you.

170
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,599
I mean, it makes sense, right?

171
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,476
That's what I'm saying.

172
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,436
- Right?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,605
I mean, you're going
to regret it, though,

174
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,691
because I'm a complete
and utter slob.

175
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:07,942
Like I already don't know that.

176
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,987
I know, but once
all my stuff is there...

177
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,655
- All right.
- So you'll move in.

178
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:13,990
- Yeah.
- That's great.

179
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,075
And you guys can have dinner
at our house.

180
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:47,940
Here we go.
Tap, tap, tap.

181
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:50,943
Hold closed and grind
side to side for me.

182
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,863
Perfect.
And let's get our front.

183
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,782
Tap, tap, tap.
One, two, three.

184
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,659
Hold it closed.
Grind side to side.

185
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,411
Perfect.

186
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,705
All right.

187
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,960
Mirror.

188
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,554
All right, Mrs. Elvsted,
let's just take a look

189
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,890
and see what we've got here.

190
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:24,060
Uh-huh.
Okay.

191
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,229
Okay, Mrs. Elvsted,
so be sure to floss.

192
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,444
We'll see you next time.

193
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,575
Who's next?

194
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,078
Um, no one today.

195
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,705
Mrs. Koppleson canceled.

196
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,351
Dad?

197
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,311
Yeah?

198
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:10,231
I was thinking, um...

199
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,817
I think we need some new blood.

200
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,528
We could advertise.

201
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:19,073
That's too expensive.

202
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,658
We have to--

203
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,328
we have to spend money
to make money, right?

204
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,746
I could call around.

205
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,290
I could-- I could do
some research.

206
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,792
Who would you call?

207
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,377
I don't know.

208
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:35,089
Look at bus ads
or call some newspapers.

209
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,508
I'm not comfortable with that.

210
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,391
Okay.

211
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,132
You feel good.

212
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,760
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,682
Oh, it's amazing.

214
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:31,270
Ah!

215
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,149
So, what are his--

216
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,902
what are your brother's symptoms?

217
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,654
Oh, um,

218
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,200
he's really uptight.

219
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,493
- Drink this.
- Thank you.

220
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,412
He's judgmental,

221
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,665
he's rigid and...

222
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,542
I don't want
a character assassination,

223
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,377
- I just want his symptoms.
- Oh.

224
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,171
He's, um--

225
00:13:57,338 --> 00:14:00,925
he's really, uh, depleted.

226
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,469
His, like, energy is gone.

227
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:07,264
- He's all sucked in and wan and...
- Okay.

228
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,432
...he's not sleeping good.

229
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,683
I'll give him a liver tonic
and throw in

230
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,727
- something for gallbladder.
- Okay.

231
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,687
And have him come see me,
why don't you?

232
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,022
All right.

233
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,274
That's not gonna happen,
but all right.

234
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,903
He really should.
I can help him better if he's...

235
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,738
And what about you?
How are you doing?

236
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,533
You feel good,
so things are good.

237
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,537
What?

238
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,205
Jesse asked me
to move in with him.

239
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,291
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

240
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,379
Last night in front
of my family at dinner.

241
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:39,964
- Wow.
- Yeah.

242
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,091
- Wow. No joke?
- What the F, right?

243
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,134
That's--

244
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,012
did you-- are you-- you're--

245
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,348
Yeah.
I mean, ugh, I don't know.

246
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,934
- Yes, good, good.
- I'm kind of flipping out about it.

247
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,102
Well, of course you are.

248
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,104
You wouldn't be you
if you didn't flip out about it.

249
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,356
It's great, it's fine.
It's normal, it's normal.

250
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,483
- Really?
- Yes.

251
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,152
I mean, he was supposed to be
my rebound, you know.

252
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,822
- Yeah.
- Just my get-back-in-the-game guy.

253
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,324
Yeah, and look what happened.
Isn't it awful?

254
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,118
- Something beautiful happened.
- Is it?

255
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:10,578
To actually have a--

256
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,121
- Is it? Yes.
- I don't know.

257
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,748
Is being tied down again
gonna be awesome

258
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,459
or is it gonna be

259
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,128
like a cage and like...

260
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,756
No. Honey, I keep telling you,
I've always told you,

261
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:26,176
you have something
that, yes, started sexually.

262
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,344
Mm-hmm.

263
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,139
And it's grown into
something beautiful.

264
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,640
That's what happened
for me and Charlie.

265
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,017
We started out that way

266
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:37,021
and that was the most meaningful
relationship of my entire life.

267
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,315
And you know what?

268
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:45,863
I didn't even appreciate what I had
until Charlie passed.

269
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,781
It wasn't until after.

270
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,367
And I-- I--

271
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,828
I just don't want you to fuck it up.

272
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,788
I don't want you to fuck it up.

273
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,790
All right.

274
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,418
- Just appreciate.
- Mm-hmm.

275
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:00,669
Okay?

276
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,296
- All right, cheers.
- Gratitude.

277
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,381
- Gratitude and appreciate.
- I adore you.

278
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,425
What time's your first victim?

279
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,178
- Oh, 10 minutes ago.
- Okay.

280
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,263
Here, take these, take these.
I mixed these for you.

281
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,182
This is my special blend,
very proud of that.

282
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,975
- Love it.
- I'll bring the tonic down later, okay?

283
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,143
Thank you.
You're a rock star.

284
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,728
Oh, and I will put
your check in the box.

285
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,021
Oh, yeah.
Two months.

286
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,315
I know, two months.
I'm sorry.

287
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:58,811
- Can I help you?
- Um, yeah. Jenny sent me.

288
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,562
She said I could get
a free cleaning.

289
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,523
Oh. Uh, okay.

290
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,483
- Um, Jenny.-
- Oh, Henry.

291
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,943
- Hey.
- You came.

292
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,028
Yeah, it's okay.
Come back.

293
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,321
Okay.

294
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,157
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

295
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,243
All right. Open up.

296
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,453
Wait, what-- what are you doing?

297
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,871
- Oh, hey, Dad.
- Hi.

298
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,206
This is Henry.

299
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,209
He-- we know each other
from Cafe Fiore.

300
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,878
- Hello.
- Hello.

301
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,257
You know each other how?

302
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:30,259
Oh, I work there.

303
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,177
He makes my coffee
every morning.

304
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:33,804
Oh.

305
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,597
Yeah, I just figured
that the chair was empty,

306
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,808
so I'd just give him a quick polish.

307
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,351
What do you mean?

308
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,729
Well, I didn't want
to bother you, you know.

309
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,480
He's my friend.
I was just doing him a favor.

310
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,608
He hasn't had a cleaning in a while.

311
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,902
That's not right.

312
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,654
What do you mean?

313
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,698
You don't have the training.

314
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:57,244
Yeah, but I've seen you do it,
like, a thousand times.

315
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:03,417
Well, I think it'd be better
if you stayed on your side.

316
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,588
Don't you?

317
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,188
So, when was the last time
you saw a dentist?

318
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:28,150
- About five years ago.
- Oh, five-- well, you're due.

319
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,737
G3.

320
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,951
The mirror.

321
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,631
Okay, let's open up
and take a look.

322
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,801
All right, what have we got
going on here?

323
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,678
Uh-huh.

324
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,998
I'm gonna start you facedown
under the top sheet

325
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,459
and you can hang
your things here.

326
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,836
- I'll see you in a second.
- All right, thanks.

327
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,671
All right, thank you.

328
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,144
- Does it feel warm enough in here?
- Uh-huh, it's nice.

329
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,854
Good.

330
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,063
I'll start with light pressure
at first, okay?

331
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,814
You tell me if you want me
to adjust it.

332
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,650
Okay.

333
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,829
Hey.

334
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,456
Hey.

335
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,458
How's it going?

336
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,794
Okay.

337
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,671
How's your day?

338
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,631
Shitty.

339
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,051
Well, why don't you come over here
and I'll give you a back rub?

340
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,844
Aw.

341
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,472
That sounds nice.

342
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,518
It's tempting, but...

343
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:51,979
I have so much packing to do.

344
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:58,110
Oh, okay.

345
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:02,280
Um, I'll see you tomorrow, then?

346
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,366
Yeah.

347
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,495
You okay?

348
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,498
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

349
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,376
<i>I'm just, uh--</i>

350
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,544
I don't know.

351
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:20,090
I'm just in a funky mood
or something.

352
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,802
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

353
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,055
Call me when you get up.

354
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,349
I will.

355
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,435
I love you.

356
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,687
Me, too.

357
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,857
- 'Night.
- All right, good night.

358
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:44,740
E3.

359
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,117
- Dad, he's, like, totally freaking out.
- Mirror.

360
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,244
He loves you.
He says you cured him.

361
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,537
I cured him of what?

362
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,706
- Well, he had this...
- Open, please.

363
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,416
...horrible pain.

364
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,917
It was in his jaw.

365
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,003
- TMJ?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,922
Temporomandibular
joint disorder.

367
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,257
- Right, right.
- Open, please.

368
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,217
It was so bad that he had
to stop singing.

369
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,262
And since he left the office,
I mean, he's had no pain.

370
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:11,308
My granddaughter has TMJ.

371
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,643
Maybe you could cure her.

372
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,438
Well, that's doubtful, Mrs. Olsen.

373
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,066
But if she comes in,

374
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,859
I'd be happy to take a look.

375
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,487
All right, let's open, please.

376
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,280
All right.

377
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,129
All right.

378
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,065
I hate to disappoint you,
but if you came here

379
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,902
hoping that I could somehow
magically take away your pain,

380
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,238
I can't do that.

381
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:51,074
Okay.
I understand.

382
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,494
Do you?

383
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,371
Yes.

384
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,498
Just do whatever you did
for the last guy,

385
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:01,459
the guy that you cured.

386
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,837
I didn't cure him.

387
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,797
Okay.

388
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:10,135
Just so long as you understand.

389
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:11,720
Okay.

390
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:21,188
Okay, and open, and...

391
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,894
Mr...

392
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,570
What happened?

393
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,614
Word of mouth.

394
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,665
Mr. Harris?

395
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,337
Right this way.

396
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,763
Hi, this is Abby.

397
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,307
Due to some
unforeseen circumstances,

398
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:43,979
I will not be seeing any clients
for the time being.

399
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:46,856
I'm sorry for any inconvenience
that this causes anybody

400
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,818
and I hope to be back soon.

401
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,028
Namaste.

402
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,830
And Abby came running in here.

403
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,708
Grandpa Douglas
had just mixed a batch of this.

404
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,127
Boom.

405
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,087
And everywhere.

406
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:10,505
It was all over his face.

407
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,675
I was sitting
right where you are, giggling.

408
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,135
And, I mean--

409
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,387
Oh, my gosh!
Look what else came.

410
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,558
Look what you are doing
for people.

411
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,393
I don't understand it.

412
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,855
It's not like I'm doing
anything differently.

413
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,649
- Oh.
- Henry's singing again.

414
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,194
Well, that's great,
but I'm not responsible for that.

415
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,322
He thinks you are.

416
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,578
Here.

417
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,623
All right.
Look.

418
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,295
"To my favorite dentist."

419
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,511
"To family dentistry."

420
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,305
I'm gonna take the car out for a bit.

421
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,072
- Oh, hey, Henry.
- Hey, Jenny.

422
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,199
Did you come back
to see my dad again?

423
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,701
Um, well, both of you, actually.

424
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,829
I, um, wanted to give you
tickets to my show.

425
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,540
Oh! Oh, wow.
Thank you.

426
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,417
Thank you.

427
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,836
It wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for your dad.

428
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:34,672
Well, that's incredible.
Thanks.

429
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,050
No, it's just a little
invite-only thing.

430
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,427
- It's no big deal.
- No, that's cool.

431
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,054
We'll definitely, definitely come.

432
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,472
- Cool.
- I--

433
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,267
Um, I-- I made this for you.

434
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,019
Oh, is this your music?

435
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:52,399
No, it's just some songs
that I thought you'd like.

436
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,237
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

437
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:01,116
That's so-- that's really sweet.

438
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,784
Thanks.

439
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:07,247
Um, I gotta go, but I-- I'm really
looking forward to this.

440
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,541
- Cool.
- Thank you.

441
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,584
I'll see you there.

442
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,521
Brandon said he's headed
down to the Galway.-

443
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,565
Oh, yeah, the Kraken?

444
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,109
Kraken, Galway--
it's the same thing.

445
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,694
He's really heading down there.

446
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,946
Hey,Jesse.

447
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,615
Jenny, hey.

448
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,075
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

449
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,827
I'm good.
I'm doing good.

450
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,996
- Is that the--
- Um, here.

451
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,332
It's-- well, it's--

452
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,084
- it's not a Hot Pocket.
- Oh.

453
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:56,713
Wow, that-- that is not
a Hot Pocket.

454
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,007
God, you really didn't--

455
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,176
No, I know, but I was--
I was gonna--

456
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,637
you know, I was gonna do it anyway
because I-- well, I love to cook

457
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:08,183
and the conversation
just sort of inspired it, so...

458
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,185
God, this smells great.

459
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:11,686
- I mean--
- Good.

460
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,229
I feel--

461
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:16,608
No, don't feel--
I mean, it was-- it's nothing.

462
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,819
It's totally not anything,
you know.

463
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,364
- Thank you.
- I will...

464
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,783
- Yeah, I'll see you.
- Yeah.

465
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,286
Hey, Jenny.

466
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,832
Thanks.
This is really nice.

467
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,825
All right, Abby...

468
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,454
What?

469
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,581
Will you do me a favor?

470
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,375
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

471
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,502
Will you take your shirt off?

472
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,641
What?

473
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,981
Will you kiss me?

474
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,025
What?

475
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,279
Will you kiss me?

476
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,338
What the fuck?

477
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,048
Abby!

478
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:26,446
There, Reiki, Reiki.
"What is Reiki?"

479
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,198
That's what Abby's friend does.

480
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:52,305
And, um, how long
have you had this pain?

481
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,182
Oh, for, like, ever.

482
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,225
That's what it feels like, at least.

483
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,478
Well, it started in a kind of
on-and-off way.

484
00:32:58,645 --> 00:32:59,937
Okay.

485
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:02,815
I was still working on the boat,
so it was before 1998.

486
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,400
Right, right.

487
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,611
And, um...

488
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,030
then it started to get real bad.

489
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:11,991
Is it on the-- right in here?

490
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,534
- It's both sides.
- Both sides.

491
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,536
- Both sides hurt.
- Right.

492
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:18,122
So that was before 1998
when it started.

493
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,124
And then, uh...

494
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:29,050
- Um...
- And then after '98?

495
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,719
Yeah...

496
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,055
it started getting really bad
and really persistent all the time.

497
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,307
- Yeah.
- You know, and, um...

498
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,975
so that was, like,
when I got divorced.

499
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:41,020
- So that was back in, like, 2005.
- Mm.

500
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,398
2005-- right.

501
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,274
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Oh, yeah.

502
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,485
I've heard great things.

503
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,654
Well, let's not get
our hopes up too high,

504
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,156
but we'll see what we can do.

505
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,705
♪ The simplest of things ♪

506
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:04,001
♪ Not the least of all my mind... ♪

507
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,338
♪ Mind... ♪

508
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,021
Close your-- ahem.

509
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,821
Wow.

510
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,867
Okay, what's going on with you?

511
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,828
I don't-- I don't know.

512
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:43,291
Your energy is--
is just completely whopper jawed.

513
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,045
You wanna...

514
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,672
I just--

515
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,299
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

516
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,010
I just-- I feel really weird.

517
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,845
Everything is weird.
I don't know.

518
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,847
- I--
- Weird?

519
00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,724
Yeah, I just--

520
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:01,976
luau

521
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,353
I just-- I feel off.

522
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,938
Well, your energy is off.

523
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,525
It's completely all over the place

524
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:13,946
and incredibly fearful.

525
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,867
I feel like I can't--

526
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,662
- I don't know.
- You can't...?

527
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:25,208
With everything I can't--
like, with Jesse I can't--

528
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:28,044
I don't want him to touch me.
I can't connect.

529
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,505
I don't know how to--
I don't know.

530
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:32,840
- Is there something?
- Yeah.

531
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,843
Too much here.

532
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,137
When was the last time you guys
went out and just-- to, you know...?

533
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,889
You love to dance.

534
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,933
When was the last time
you went dancing?

535
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,227
Hiking?

536
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,687
I can't.
I just--

537
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,233
I need you to fix me, please.

538
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,611
You can fix yourself.

539
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,404
I can't.

540
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,240
Maybe you need
a physiological trigger.

541
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,408
Have you ever tried MDMA?

542
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:03,037
- What, like ecstasy?
- Yeah.

543
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:06,874
It's kind of a big deal
in certain psychotherapy circles.

544
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,584
Are you fucking with me
right now?

545
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,836
No.

546
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,754
Charlie and I tried it.
We did it.

547
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:14,090
It was a great way for us to...

548
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,677
reconnect.

549
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,137
What?

550
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,808
I just don't know
where I would even get it.

551
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,895
Hold on.

552
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,320
Wow.

553
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,996
I haven't looked there since...

554
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,789
Anyway-

555
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,417
One for you, one for Jesse.

556
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,753
Think of it as a hall pass,

557
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,591
a permission slip
to just let go of your fear

558
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,050
and embrace the world.

559
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,392
Or not.

560
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:27,371
Oh, my God!
I'm such a jerk.

561
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,081
I am so sorry I'm so late.

562
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,750
That looks amazing.

563
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:31,918
Where were you?

564
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,378
Oh, Bronwyn had a cancellation
and I just tried to sneak in,

565
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:36,464
- and it just went way over.
- Yeah?

566
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,050
But I think she had
a really good idea.

567
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,053
- What's that?
- Look what she gave me.

568
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,388
What is that?

569
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:46,724
Ecstasy.

570
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,728
- Ecstasy?
- Yeah.

571
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,649
Awe-awesome.

572
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:55,816
Yeah, I don't know.

573
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,693
I thought it could be
really good for us right now.

574
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,028
Yeah.

575
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:01,072
I kind of want to do it
before Paul and Jenny get here,

576
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,782
but we should probably wait
until after they leave.

577
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,617
Probably.

578
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,286
What's wrong?

579
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,455
Nothing.

580
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:10,873
Ecstasy, huh?

581
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,709
What do you think?

582
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:16,545
Abby, I think you're acting
a little bit nuts is what I think.

583
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,089
Pssh. Why?

584
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,840
Abby, we haven't even had
a chance to talk about

585
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,384
what happened yesterday
at the shop.

586
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,551
Yeah, I know.
I just-- I--

587
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,971
I mean, come on.
What was that?

588
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,723
You come in, you take off--
and then you just leave?

589
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,893
- Yeah.
- Imagine how that made me feel.

590
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,522
Do you really think that taking drugs
right now is what we need to do?

591
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:36,649
I think that's the last thing
that we need to do.

592
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,735
I think we need to stop and get real
with each other for a second.

593
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:42,071
I'm being real with you.

594
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,823
Abby, you're an hour
and a half late

595
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,866
to a dinner that I've been
cooking for your family,

596
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,535
- which is totally fine...
- Yeah.

597
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:50,663
...but then you waltz in here
with drugs in your hand and--

598
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,375
I'm sorry, it may be me,
but it feels a little bit weird.

599
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:55,876
I don't know.
I just thought it would be...

600
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,503
What, you need to take

601
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,257
some sort of, you know, drugs,
to be with me?

602
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:02,842
- Is that where we're at?
- No, no.

603
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,885
God, no.
I just thought it would be fun.

604
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,721
I'm just saying, like,

605
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,056
you're just acting
a little bit different.

606
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:10,307
I know.

607
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,059
Is there something
going on with you?

608
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,478
- I mean...
- Yeah.

609
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:18,149
I just wanted to do something
that might be fun.

610
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,483
I don't know.
It's stupid.

611
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,193
So stupid.
It was a stupid idea.

612
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,989
No, it's not stupid.
It's just caught me off guard and--

613
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:29,618
- Okay, they're here.
- All right, you should go get--

614
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,203
You know what?
Forget I said anything about it.

615
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,915
- It's a stupid idea.
- No, it's-- it's...

616
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,753
Ecstasy.

617
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,506
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

618
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:44,592
Yay, salad.
Thank you.

619
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:45,801
- Come on in.
- I got this wine.

620
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,845
Thanks.

621
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:50,681
You guys wanna have a seat?

622
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:53,350
It's kind of incredible, actually.

623
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:56,562
You're, like, changing lives.

624
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:59,356
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are. Yeah.

625
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,317
Henry, he's gonna--

626
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,111
he hasn't performed
in, like, two years or something.

627
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:06,572
That's because of you.

628
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:09,867
You should be-- you should feel
really, really good about that.

629
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:11,786
That's great, Paul.

630
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,245
- Done?
- Yeah.

631
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,289
Yeah.
Thank you.

632
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:20,628
Jesse's organizing a 30-mile
urban bike race downtown.

633
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,588
- Oh, come on.
- You are.

634
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:25,049
It's a bike ride.
More like a ride.

635
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,967
- It's not, like, a race.
- I thought it was a race.

636
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,552
No, it's like a group ride.

637
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,554
- Oh, group ride.
- Yeah.

638
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,389
- That sounds really cool, actually.
- Yeah.

639
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,183
And what's the point?

640
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:40,981
Fun.

641
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,737
Can you pass your plate, please?

642
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,657
- That was really, really good.
- Thank you.

643
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:52,159
- It was really delicious.
- Thank you.

644
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:58,999
How is it being roomies,
you guys?

645
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,294
Um, I'll let you know when I--

646
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,838
when I finish packing.

647
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:06,090
- Somebody's been lazy.
- Yeah.

648
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:08,467
- You're not moving in?
- I am moving in.

649
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,471
This weekend
we're gonna tackle it.

650
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,265
Just been busy.

651
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:17,852
Oh, Paul, I got you that elixir
from Bronwyn.

652
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,396
She said she wanted
to see you in person,

653
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,857
but I told her that was probably
never gonna happen.

654
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:24,859
Why did you say that?

655
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,444
Because you said you would--
I don't know.

656
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:30,197
Here.
Her tonic.

657
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:31,991
Knock yourself out.

658
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,289
What are these?

659
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,378
Ecstasy.

660
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,047
- What?
- Yeah.

661
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:48,591
Are you taking that?

662
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:50,467
Yeah.

663
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,595
Why are you taking ecstasy?

664
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,389
It's the hug drug, Paul.

665
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,099
I'm addicted.

666
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,894
I'm actually a fucking drug addict.
I wanted to tell you about it.

667
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,937
Who wants dessert?

668
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,107
Chia seed pudding.

669
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:14,325
That tofu was so-- I don't
usually like tofu and I just--

670
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,160
Oh, thanks.

671
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:19,330
I cooked it in, like,
really special olive oil, so...

672
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,332
- Oh.
- So, like...

673
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,132
Welcome.

674
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,510
Thank you.

675
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:38,015
So, did you have a particular goal
in mind for today?

676
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:42,144
No, just--
I'm curious and I...

677
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,437
Okay.

678
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:46,398
Just Abby, you know,
my sister,

679
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:51,445
she said that it's amazing, so...

680
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:52,780
I think it is.

681
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:54,865
I think you're going
to really enjoy it.

682
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:56,617
So why don't we just get started
into the session

683
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:57,785
and see where it takes us?

684
00:42:57,952 --> 00:43:00,120
- Okay.
- okay.

685
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,956
I'll take your coat for you.

686
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,210
How's the temperature
feel in here? Okay?

687
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:07,378
- In here?
- Yeah.

688
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,380
- It's good.
- Okay.

689
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,930
Oh, you don't need to remove
your clothes for Reiki.

690
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:20,599
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:21,976
- No, it's fine.
- Sorr-- no.

692
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:23,227
No, you know what?
You're actually--

693
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:24,770
if you're more comfortable,

694
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:26,689
I'd love you to remove
your clothes.

695
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:29,525
I mean, if you want to,
if you feel comfortable.

696
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:30,943
Mmm...

697
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,569
Okay.
All right, good.

698
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:35,364
So why don't you just climb on
up here and get comfortable

699
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:38,325
with your head this way?

700
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:40,119
Okay.

701
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:44,290
Oh!
Wow, okay.

702
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,458
That's the most interesting way

703
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,127
anyone's ever gotten
on my Reiki table.

704
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,628
Okay.

705
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:50,879
- Okay.
- Just put my head up there?

706
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,132
- Yes.
- All right.

707
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:54,800
Okay.

708
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:02,099
I-- okay, uh, that looks actually
really comfortable,

709
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:03,350
but I should have been
more specific.

710
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:06,103
I meant on your-- if you can get
on your back with your head up here.

711
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,313
Okay.

712
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,480
- Perfect.
- Like that?

713
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:10,149
- Yes. Yeah.
- Okay.

714
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:11,358
- Is that good?
- That's perfect.

715
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:14,320
Just lie-- if you let your feet--
your legs lie flat on the table.

716
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:15,487
Okay.

717
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:17,489
Yeah, just completely let
your legs fall where they--

718
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:19,116
let your feet fall.

719
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:20,659
- Like that?
- Just absolutely relax.

720
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:23,954
- Okay.
- Let every muscle just relax.

721
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,581
- Your hands.
- Okay.

722
00:44:25,748 --> 00:44:27,750
Just resting comfortably
at your side.

723
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,501
- All right.
- Yeah, just be comfortable.

724
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,712
- All right.
- Everything's fine. This is good.

725
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,089
Okay, you know what?

726
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:37,509
Maybe you should picture
yourself someplace

727
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:41,096
where you feel
the most comfortable,

728
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:44,808
the place where you feel safe,
the place where you feel happy.

729
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:47,478
You picture that.

730
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:50,189
The office, like at my office.

731
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,358
- Your office?
- Mm-hmm.

732
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,778
Maybe we should try

733
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:59,823
to get out of the office
and go to the beach

734
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,243
and sit on the sand and feel
the warm sun on your skin.

735
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,580
I'd rather-- I'd rather
be at the office.

736
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:08,415
Okay, all right.

737
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:12,127
So, is there a favorite chair
in your office or a favorite...

738
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,421
- I like the back room where--
- The back room.

739
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:17,174
- To look at X-rays.
- Where you look at X-rays, okay.

740
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:20,594
Well, you look at X-rays
in your back room

741
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,055
and I will do Reiki.

742
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:24,723
- Okay.
- Okay.

743
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,643
Just get in your back room,
close your eyes.

744
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:38,153
Are your eyes closed?

745
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,739
- Yep.
- okay.

746
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,867
Yeah.

747
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:51,417
Huh. Okay, wow.

748
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,584
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

749
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,086
- That was-- that was great.
- What's going on?

750
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:55,421
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

751
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,424
No, I just want to know
what it's about.

752
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,591
- Reiki?
- Yeah.

753
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,635
Like, how you're doing--
what are you--

754
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:02,803
how you're doing it.

755
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,597
How-- how are you doing it?

756
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:06,890
What are you...?

757
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:10,727
Well, do you want to learn
how to do Reiki?

758
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,688
Yes.

759
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:14,815
Because I can-- I mean,
I can show you how.

760
00:46:14,982 --> 00:46:16,900
- I can teach you.
- Great. Great.

761
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:20,028
But it is energy work.

762
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:21,196
You know that, don't you?

763
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:22,906
Are you aware of that?
It's energy work.

764
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,867
Energy.

765
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:27,119
And I channel energy into you

766
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:30,706
to help you balance your energy
and-- you know what?

767
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:31,915
Why don't we just-- for today,

768
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:34,293
why don't I work on you
and you can feel what it feels like,

769
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,295
and then we can meet
another time

770
00:46:36,462 --> 00:46:40,799
and I can explain
everything to do with Reiki?

771
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:41,967
Okay.

772
00:46:42,134 --> 00:46:45,387
You could even be a Reiki master
if you wanted to be.

773
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:47,014
Is that what you want?

774
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,143
You could be a Reiki master!

775
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:54,271
- How's that sound?
- It sounds good.

776
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:57,149
Okay, so get back in your office.

777
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:59,151
Okay. All right.

778
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:01,403
- Okay?
- Okay,

779
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,197
Scoot down a little bit.
That's perfect.

780
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:04,615
- Is that good?
- Yes.

781
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,283
- Okay, you ready? Here we go.
- Okay.

782
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,910
- Okay.
- Let's go.

783
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,004
Pop your legs up on the couch.

784
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:21,173
Just cross them over.

785
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:24,259
Can you get that up there?

786
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,346
Stay still, stay still.

787
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:29,348
Just let go.

788
00:47:29,515 --> 00:47:31,767
Let go.

789
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:34,061
Just relax down a little bit.

790
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:39,399
Good. See?
You're okay. I've got you.

791
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:40,943
You're safe.

792
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,653
You're-- okay.

793
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:46,240
You know what?
Put your legs down on the floor.

794
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:47,741
Just put them down on the floor.
That's better.

795
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:49,159
And onto the next position.

796
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:53,747
Just over the heart,
above the breast.

797
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:02,923
And then move down
to the lower abdo--

798
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,300
yeah, right down in there.

799
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:22,609
So, what we're gonna do,
Dillon, in the first step

800
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:25,988
is we're just going to be--
put some articulate...

801
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:27,906
Are you ready?

802
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:33,036
All right.

803
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:34,204
All right, here we go.

804
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:37,416
One, two, three.

805
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:41,211
- How's that feel?
- Oh...

806
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:44,131
Better?

807
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,969
- Huh?
- I think it...

808
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,856
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, you're welcome.

809
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,068
- Thank you.
- Oh.

810
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:06,778
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

811
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,488
You're welcome.

812
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:14,369
It's a miracle.

813
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,848
I-- I felt something.

814
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:38,226
I felt-- did you feel something?

815
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:10,277
Come on.

816
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,721
See how that is.

817
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,224
Good.

818
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,562
Looks good.

819
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:48,273
Thank you.

820
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,945
I went to Bronwyn.

821
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,699
- What do you mean?
- I went.

822
00:51:57,866 --> 00:51:59,201
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

823
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,078
Did you like it?

824
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:05,248
Yes.

825
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,211
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

826
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,963
And how are you?

827
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,257
Been better.

828
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:19,721
And, um...

829
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:24,142
with the ecstasy, is that...?

830
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:26,478
- Please don't start it.
- No, I...

831
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,441
- I have never taken it.
- But you had it in your purse.

832
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:34,110
I know, but it was
just a crazy idea.

833
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:38,073
I just thought I could
make some things better.

834
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,826
With Jesse?
You and Jesse?

835
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,912
I don't know,
it's supposed to help you

836
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,083
open up and help you
connect and...

837
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,252
But not to be.

838
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,504
Don't worry.
Your sister isn't a drug addict.

839
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:54,756
Okay.
You have to be careful.

840
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:56,424
I know.

841
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:03,723
How does Jenny seem to you?

842
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,767
Fine.

843
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,769
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

844
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,272
I don't think she's fine.

845
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:12,065
What do you mean?

846
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:17,112
I think you need
to let her go, Paul.

847
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,826
I'm not-- I'm not holding her
hostage or anything.

848
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:25,161
I just think she wants
to be doing other things.

849
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:27,330
I think she wants--

850
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:29,374
I think she wants to go to school.

851
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,710
In fact, I know she wants
to go to school.

852
00:53:31,877 --> 00:53:34,796
She has never said anything
to me about school that I know--

853
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:36,965
Because she thinks
you don't want her to go.

854
00:53:37,132 --> 00:53:39,134
- She thinks you want her--
- We never even--

855
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:41,052
- Ask her.
- Never even discussed...

856
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:42,637
Yeah, I know
you never discussed.

857
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:45,682
- Where do you come up with this?
- I come up with it from her.

858
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:47,559
She filled out
all her college applications

859
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:49,936
and she won't send them in because
she thinks you're gonna be crushed.

860
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,397
Yeah. Okay.

861
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,567
You're a piece of work,
you know that?

862
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,904
Yeah? How am I--
how am I a piece of work?

863
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,155
Um, okay.

864
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:03,158
You come into my house,
okay, and--

865
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:04,743
I come into your house?
What do you mean?

866
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,286
It's our house.
It's our parents' house.

867
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:07,954
- Okay, yeah--
- It's the house that we grew up in.

868
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:09,623
Our house, our house,
but it's the house--

869
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:12,083
- That we were both given.
- the house that I've been maintaining.

870
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,586
The house that I've been paying
property taxes on since Mom died.

871
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:16,421
Okay, fine, fine.
It's your house, it's your house.

872
00:54:16,588 --> 00:54:18,173
- Your house.
- That house that I've...

873
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,966
Mm-hmm.

874
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:22,969
And then--
so you come in and then--

875
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:26,806
and then you accuse me of holding
my daughter hostage, okay?

876
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:30,143
As opposed to, like, letting her
live here rent-free,

877
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:33,104
providing her
with gainful employment,

878
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:35,065
teaching her--
teaching her a skill.

879
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,692
Yeah, in a field she has
zero interest in.

880
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:43,114
Just ask her.
Ask her if she's happy.

881
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:48,078
I don't know.

882
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:50,163
I'd better put this away.

883
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:44,718
Is he in here?

884
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,136
- Scaler.
- Hello? Is he here?

885
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:48,221
- Hold on, sir.
- I'd like my money back, please.

886
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:51,266
This guy is a goddamn fraud.
I paid him money.

887
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:53,643
Fucking TMJ specialist.
Hello? Is he here?

888
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,020
All right, he's with a patient.

889
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:57,564
Be right back.
I'll just be right back.

890
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:00,191
Hello?
Yeah, hey, buddy!

891
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:01,693
Yeah.

892
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,944
- Good, go ahead and do that there.
- He-- he's--

893
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:05,280
- Doctor!
- He's in the middle of a procedure.

894
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:07,866
This guy is a goddamn fraud.
Hello, Doctor!

895
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,284
Oh, there you are.

896
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:11,703
You did not cure my TMJ.

897
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:18,168
No, but I never--
I never promised.

898
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:19,753
You didn't promise?
I paid you money.

899
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,671
I'd like my money back, please.

900
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:23,715
Not only is my TMJ raging,

901
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:26,468
but I left here with the worst
headache of my life.

902
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:28,845
And I still have it.
You know, it's getting worse.

903
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:31,306
Maybe if you could calm down
and stop yelling at everybody.-

904
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:34,225
- Oh, screw you!
- Okay, that's-- that--

905
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:36,436
You know,
do not get in that chair.

906
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,521
This guy is a...

907
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:40,815
<i>- Oh.
- Oh my God!</i>

908
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:43,276
Oh, my God! Um...

909
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:44,944
Mr. Fro-- Mr. Frobischer.

910
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:49,616
- Can you hear me? Can you hear--
- Bag. Bag.

911
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:51,159
- Bag?
- Pocket.

912
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:52,327
Bag in your pocket?

913
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:54,329
- All right.
- Here, here's your bag.

914
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:59,209
- There's nothing in it.
- Dumbass.

915
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,919
There's nothing...

916
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:08,343
That's it, that's it.

917
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,470
You're okay now.
Just take it easy.

918
00:57:10,637 --> 00:57:12,263
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Just stay lying on the floor.

919
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,265
No, don't get up.
No, you shouldn't get up.

920
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,476
- Don't get up. All right--
- I'm fine, no thanks to you.

921
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:21,981
- Why don't you sit down?
- Nope.

922
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:26,111
I'm outta here.
Thanks for nothing, buddy.

923
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:37,265
I'm-- I'm begging you, Abby.

924
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:39,976
I'm begging you,
please talk to me.

925
00:58:40,143 --> 00:58:41,227
Just talk to me.

926
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:44,439
I know things have been
a little weird,

927
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:47,400
but we have to talk, baby.

928
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,235
Please.

929
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,416
There you go.

930
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,543
Mr. Pfizer, let me just...

931
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,924
Dad?

932
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:13,927
Oh.

933
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,095
Sorry there, Mr. Pfizer.

934
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:18,598
I just, um--

935
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:19,807
looking good there.

936
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:22,185
We're almost done anyway.

937
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,397
Jenny will rinse you out and...

938
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:35,198
Thank you so much, Mr. Pfizer.

939
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:39,535
I hope you have
a great rest of your day.

940
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:42,914
And we will...

941
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:46,125
see you next time.

942
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:52,483
Jenny?

943
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,907
Abby?

944
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:49,911
Hey.

945
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,539
It's Adrian.

946
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:59,212
Wow.

947
01:04:00,213 --> 01:04:02,215
Thought that was you.

948
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:07,220
Can I sit down?

949
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,804
Yeah.

950
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:23,736
How are ya?

951
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:32,245
I don't know.

952
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:36,874
Yeah.

953
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,502
God, I--

954
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:43,756
I don't think I've seen you since...

955
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:48,553
Gina's.

956
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:51,931
Yeah.

957
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:56,269
Yeah. Yeah.

958
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,691
Yeah.

959
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,903
I don't drink like that
anymore, you know.

960
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,738
Luau

961
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:14,537
I've been sober for probably
about a year and a half.

962
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:18,040
Good for you.

963
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:19,917
Thanks.

964
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:23,421
Anyway-

965
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:28,634
So, you don't-- you don't know?

966
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:33,222
You look good.

967
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:35,266
Thanks.

968
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:39,103
You guys still over
on Columbia Street?

969
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:42,648
No. That's-- that's why I'm back.

970
01:05:42,815 --> 01:05:44,734
My grandma passed away.

971
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,361
- Aw.
- Yeah.

972
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:49,947
I'm just back kind of
taking care of things,

973
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:51,490
get the house ready to sell.

974
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:53,576
Oh, yeah.

975
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,038
I remember that house.

976
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,510
You want to see it?

977
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:25,608
Jenny?

978
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:28,986
Jenny.

979
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:34,200
Jenny?

980
01:06:58,808 --> 01:07:00,351
Jenny?

981
01:07:00,518 --> 01:07:02,395
It's Dad.
Uh...

982
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,357
Okay, call me.

983
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:11,821
Okay. Bye.

984
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,865
All right.

985
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:56,383
I remember...

986
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:00,471
the light.

987
01:09:03,057 --> 01:09:05,142
The light in this room.

988
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:08,062
It felt like...

989
01:09:11,607 --> 01:09:13,943
morning, but it wasn't.

990
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:20,241
I remember your bed
on the floor with...

991
01:09:23,285 --> 01:09:25,412
just a box spring.

992
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:32,503
I remember UB40
on the turntable.

993
01:09:36,173 --> 01:09:38,175
"You shoot me down
in flames."

994
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,809
I remember...

995
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:54,608
you asking me...

996
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:57,695
if I trusted you.

997
01:10:03,576 --> 01:10:06,704
I remember you opened
your button flies with one "foop."

998
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:10,207
And we both started cracking up.

999
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:16,589
I remember...

1000
01:10:18,007 --> 01:10:20,801
I remember our bodies...

1001
01:10:23,429 --> 01:10:25,389
like one...

1002
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:30,644
thing, like one...

1003
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:36,483
complete thing.

1004
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:48,829
I remember feeling like
maybe I didn't have a body.

1005
01:10:57,004 --> 01:10:58,714
Did it hurt?

1006
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,636
I don't know.

1007
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:09,642
I don't know.
That part I don't remember.

1008
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:22,863
Was I your first heartbreak?

1009
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:26,367
Yeah.

1010
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:37,211
I think I knew
I was gonna be even...

1011
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:40,631
as I was doing it.

1012
01:11:43,092 --> 01:11:44,259
I'm sorry.

1013
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:46,929
I'm really sorry for that.

1014
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:52,601
It's okay.

1015
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:26,260
- Hey.
- Hi.

1016
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:28,345
Uh, Abby's not here.

1017
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:30,097
I know, I know.
I know.

1018
01:12:30,264 --> 01:12:31,890
You want to come in?

1019
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:33,183
Do you--

1020
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,562
do you want to go maybe see
some music with me?

1021
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:39,898
Um, right now?

1022
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,692
Yeah.

1023
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:46,405
Um, yeah.

1024
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:48,615
Yeah, sure.

1025
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:51,285
Um, let me just grab a jacket.

1026
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:52,661
Okay.

1027
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,620
Hey.

1028
01:13:35,621 --> 01:13:37,247
Hey.

1029
01:13:43,796 --> 01:13:46,256
What's--

1030
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,550
what is that?

1031
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,180
Just go on in.
Check it out.

a messenger for?

I think five or six years.

1063
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:43,368
Is that when you first got into,
like-- like, all the biking?

1064

Yeah. it was just
so much different then.

1065
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:51,835
I mean, just a different vibe.

1066
01:17:52,002 --> 01:17:54,129
It was more
of my anarchist stage.

1067
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:58,175
- Anarchist cycling?
- Yeah.

1068

wanted to kiss
someone so badly

1077
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:36,046

It wouldn't--

1084
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:16,002
it wouldn't have to mean
anything, you know.

1085
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:18,755
