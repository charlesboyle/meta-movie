1
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,460
Who are you?

2
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,646
What is this?

3
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,313
Your Majesty, caught him up in
a fishing net. A fishing net.

4
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,391
Sire, he's been telling
stories. Stories that...

5
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,460
We believe he's found a...

6
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,369
Ponce de Le¨®n

7
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,838
Says he found Ponce de Le¨®n's ship.

8
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,705
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,

9
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,143
Ponce de Le¨®n died 200 years ago.

10
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,808
Aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

11
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,216
The Fountain of Youth.

12
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,090
How soon can you sail?

13
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,524
With the tide.

14
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,778
Over here! Lucky heather!

15
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,987
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!

16
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,556
Pirate's execution
today. Watch him swing!

17
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,557
Pirate puppets!

18
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,218
Take that, you!

19
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,193
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

20
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:54,994
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a
trial. The hanging comes this afternoon.

21
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,795
Pirate hanging today!

22
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,639
Come on. Up you get.

23
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,539
Move along, pirate.

24
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,078
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

25
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,446
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

26
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,450
Quiet! Order!

27
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,321
Quiet!

28
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,921
Now appearing before the court,

29
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,290
the notorious and
infamous pirate, pillager,

30
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,828
- and highwayman...
- Quiet!

31
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,659
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

32
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,430
I told you, the name's
Gibbs! Joshamee Gibbs!

33
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,371
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye!

34
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,839
Presiding over these trials,

35
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:43,609
all rise and attend, the
Right Honorable Justice Smith!

36
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,159
My dear sir.

37
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,128
Quiet!

38
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,692
Now...

39
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,072
...what do we have here?

40
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,537
Jack?

41
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,165
Shut up!

42
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,977
I don't recognize him.

43
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,308
Not necessary. You were saying?

44
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,076
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

45
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,151
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

46
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,015
Is that so?

47
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,181
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told 'em.

48
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,488
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would
be happy to identify to the court

49
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,529
- if it would help my case.
- I think that would be a poor defense,

50
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,360
unless you want to be bludgeoned
again like a harp seal.

51
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,661
The prisoner claims of being innocent

52
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,204
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

53
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,065
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

54
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,734
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

55
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,743
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

56
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,575
Hang him! String him up!

57
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,379
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!

58
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,750
Shut it.

59
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,789
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of
which you've been found guilty of

60
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,692
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

61
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,229
I hereby commute your sentence,

62
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,030
and order that you be
imprisoned for the remainder

63
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,037
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

64
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,107
- What?!
- Hang him!

65
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,436
- Hang him!
- There.

66
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,941
- Balderdash!
- String him up! Hang him high!

67
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,244
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

68
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,410
to the Tower of London.

69
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,231
Thanks very much.

70
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,798
Ta.

71
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,237
Come on. Get up there.

72
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,377
Get up!

73
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,716
Hell's teeth. Now we're
both headed for prison.

74
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,520
Not to worry. I've paid off the driver.

75
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,060
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

76
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,722
Tonight, we make the coast.

77
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,198
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

78
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,131
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.

79
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,206
I arrived in London
Town just this morning

80
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,502
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs from
one appointment with the gallows.

81
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,441
Seeing as how you're still alive,

82
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,309
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

83
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,176
What happened to you, Gibbs?

84
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,877
I thought you were employed
elsewhere or otherwise engaged.

85
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,511
Aye. But I always listened like a
thief for news of the Black Pearl.

86
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,125
Nobody's seen where she
might next make port.

87
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,318
Then, I hear a rumor:

88
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,954
Jack Sparrow's in London with
a ship and looking for a crew.

89
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,827
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

90
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,197
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

91
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,860
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

92
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,235
- Am not!
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

93
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,105
but then, you've never been
the most predictable of sorts.

94
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,241
Tell me something.

95
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,906
There is another Jack Sparrow
out there sullying my good name?

96
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,211
- An impostor.
- Indeed.

97
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,119
But... an impostor with a ship.

98
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,818
And in need of a crew.

99
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,985
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

100
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,588
What about you, Jack?

101
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,598
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
to find the Fountain of Youth.

102
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,258
Any luck?

103
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,274
Circumstances arose and
forced a compelling insight

104
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,410
regarding discretion and valor.

105
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,672
- Meaning, you gave up.
- I did not.

106
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,612
I am just as bent as ever. Hellishly so.

107
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:42,584
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

108
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,382
Short trip.

109
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,362
All part of the plan, yes?

110
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,565
No.

111
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,059
You are Jack Sparrow?

112
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,798
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.

113
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,461
I've heard of you.

114
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,664
And you know who I am.

115
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,269
Face is familiar. Have
I threatened you before?

116
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,178
You are in the presence of George
Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

117
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,182
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

118
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,719
King of Great Britain
and Ireland, and of you.

119
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,555
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed

120
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,152
you have come to London to
procure a crew for your ship.

121
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,431
Vicious rumor. Not true.

122
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,693
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

123
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,066
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm
not here to procure a crew.

124
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,639
That is... someone else.

125
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,336
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

126
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,242
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

127
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,681
Find the proper one and
dispose of this impostor.

128
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,878
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

129
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,421
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

130
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,252
And I am in London.

131
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,451
To procure a crew.

132
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,323
To undertake a voyage

133
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,897
- to the Fountain...
- What?

134
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,593
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

135
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,896
Come, come.

136
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,773
We know you're in possession of a map.

137
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,072
So confiscate the map, and
to the gallows with him!

138
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,077
Have you a map?

139
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,454
- No.
- Where is it?

140
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:06,285
The truth? I lost it.

141
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:10,418
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.

142
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,158
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

143
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:19,430
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

144
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:24,168
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

145
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,712
You do know the way to the Fountain?

146
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,975
Of course I do. Look at me.

147
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,982
You could guide an expedition.

148
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,647
With your permission, your heinie,

149
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,190
you will be providing, then, a ship...

150
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,459
...and a crew?

151
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,121
And a captain.

152
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,977
Afternoon, sire.

153
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,352
If I may be so bold, why
is that man not in chains?

154
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,422
He must be manacled at once.

155
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,153
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

156
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,455
Hector.

157
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,088
How nice to see a fellow
pirate make good of himself.

158
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,363
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

159
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:30,100
On a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the Crown.

160
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,701
As may be, but first,

161
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,041
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

162
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,310
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

163
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,715
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.

164
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,790
I defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

165
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,889
If that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

166
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:01,337
Captain Barbossa, each second we
tarry, the Spanish outdistance us.

167
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,909
I have every confidence you
will prevail and be rewarded

168
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,376
with the high station you so desire.

169
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:12,280
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.

170
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,751
Jack, our sands be all but run.

171
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,221
Where's the harm in
joining the winning side?

172
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,158
And you do meet a nicer class of person.

173
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,696
I understand everything.

174
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,397
Except that wig.

175
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,867
He's getting away! Stop him!

176
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,605
- Head him off!
- No! Stop that pirate!

177
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,593
Come down!

178
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,283
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.

179
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,123
Guards! Guards!

180
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,383
- Arms at ready!
- Aye, sir!

181
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,917
Find him!

182
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,612
Finders keepers!

183
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:25,979
There!

184
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,772
Is that it?

185
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,445
Halt! Stop that carriage!

186
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,878
Head him off!

187
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,520
Out of the way!

188
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,550
Stop that pirate!

189
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,250
Move out of the way!

190
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,229
Stop that man!

191
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,898
Don't let him get away!

192
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,144
Fire!

193
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,776
He's getting away! After him! Stop him!

194
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,646
After him!

195
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,425
Filthy pirate.

196
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,672
Hello, Jackie.

197
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,869
Hello, Dad.

198
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,483
I heard you're putting together a crew.

199
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,491
If enough people keep
saying it, it must be true.

200
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,391
I heard where you're
headed. The Fountain.

201
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,020
Have you been there?

202
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,196
Does this face look like it's
been to the Fountain of Youth?

203
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,834
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.

204
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,807
There'll be items required
for the profane ritual.

205
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,572
Two chalices.

206
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,747
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two, silver.

207
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,750
From the Ponce de León
ship. You'll need both.

208
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,515
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

209
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,717
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

210
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,725
Oh, set sail. Love to.

211
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,092
But for that, I may need a ship.

212
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,530
Those folk, over
there, they have a ship.

213
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,228
They're signing up sailors right now.

214
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,565
My heart is pierced by Cupid

215
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,697
I disdain all glittering gold

216
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,207
And one last thing, Jackie.

217
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,912
The Fountain will test
you. Mark my words.

218
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,380
My heart is pierced by Cupid

219
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,451
I disdain all glittering gold

220
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,316
There is nothing can console me

221
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,082
But my jolly sailor bold

222
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,434
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

223
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,632
Aye. That is,

224
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:47,575
Jack Sparrow be putting
together a modest venture.

225
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,646
You got some nerve, ain't ya?

226
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,307
Turning up here dressed like that?

227
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,443
What are you, some kind of impostor?

228
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,782
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

229
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,591
Oi, muckers!

230
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,321
There's a bloke here what's
forgotten his own name!

231
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,362
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

232
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,297
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

233
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:14,929
Who's next?

234
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,442
Bring us some more of those ones.

235
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,780
Yeah, make it four.

236
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:41,358
You've stolen me, and I'm
here to take meself back.

237
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,165
Stop doing that.

238
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,123
Only one person alive knows that move.

239
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,996
Always wanted to do that.

240
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,734
Hello, Angelica.

241
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,013
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

242
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,345
I think I almost killed
you once or twice there.

243
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,546
I'm touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

244
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,220
But why?

245
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,021
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

246
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,891
That is not a compliment.

247
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,996
Don't worry, Jack. I
forgave you a long time ago.

248
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:37,302
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.

249
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:41,344
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

250
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,007
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

251
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,177
they're willing to put up with
any number of peculiarities.

252
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,018
There is one peculiarity with
which I will not put up with.

253
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,718
I will be impersonated as
"Captain." Nothing less.

254
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,887
Well, for that, you need a ship,

255
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,521
and as it turns out, I have one.

256
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,401
I could use a ship.

257
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,266
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.

258
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,566
There be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.

259
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:14,236
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

260
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,143
You still have a few usable years left.

261
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,610
Always so charming.

262
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:21,877
You didn't answer me.

263
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,580
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

264
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:28,352
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.

265
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,155
Wretched pirates! Find 'em! Maggots!

266
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,527
Friends of yours?

267
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,296
I may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.

268
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,234
Open it!

269
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,035
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?

270
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,540
Yes.

271
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,372
Open this door, in the
name of His Majesty.

272
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,879
You betrayed me. You
seduced me and you used me.

273
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,745
I was innocent of the ways of men.

274
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,183
You demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone I supposedly corrupted.

275
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,086
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

276
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,851
Open it!

277
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,553
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

278
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,324
What were you doing in a
Spanish convent, anyway?

279
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,229
Mistook it for a
brothel. Honest mistake.

280
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,799
- There he is!
- Over there!

281
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,159
We are at a disadvantage.

282
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,695
Speak for yourself. Unlike
some who pretend to be,

283
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,627
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

284
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,233
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

285
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,998
How can you say I used you?

286
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,336
You know exactly how.

287
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,605
I know, but how can you say it?

288
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,743
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

289
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,411
About the Fountain.

290
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,050
What do you know?

291
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,621
You don't happen to be in possession

292
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,995
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de León?

293
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,566
- No.
- Thought not.

294
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,332
- Why?
- I hear stories.

295
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,304
Rumors.

296
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,570
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

297
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,637
Yes, I am.

298
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,712
What is it? What is required?

299
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,313
A mermaid, Jack.

300
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,698
There's been a mistake.

301
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,361
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

302
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,109
- Barbossa.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

303
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,238
I trust you can tie a noose.

304
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,782
That's a hard thing,

305
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,910
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

306
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,588
You must lie in your
bed the way you made it.

307
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,791
What's happened to you?

308
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,364
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.

309
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,932
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

310
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,432
The HMS Providence sets
sail at first light.

311
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,730
If you do not care to
watch it hanging here dead,

312
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,896
with a mouth full of flies...

313
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,168
...speak now.

314
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,402
Take me with you. Any
point of the compass...

315
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:14,382
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

316
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,512
Is that where Jack be headed?

317
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:21,716
Have you anything you
can offer me, Gibbs?

318
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,384
Anything at all?

319
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,655
Upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.

320
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,437
Hand it over.

321
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,479
- You fool!
- I had just enough time

322
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,108
to study those infernal circles.

323
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:52,883
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.

324
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:58,419
Welcome back to His
Majesty's navy, Master Gibbs.

325
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,500
Show a leg, sailor!

326
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,873
Aye, sir.

327
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,711
What?

328
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,046
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

329
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,523
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,

330
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,591
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

331
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,989
No memory of the night
afore, whence he signed up

332
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,652
and drank away all his bonus money.

333
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,787
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

334
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,332
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

335
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,027
Scrum, and the pleasure's
all mine. Now, keep moving.

336
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,012
Scrum.

337
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,377
Get your elbows in!

338
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,750
Why is there a glass coffin?

339
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,355
Do I look like a man in charge?

340
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,424
- Where am I?
- 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

341
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,220
I be right honored to welcome you aboard

342
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,626
our world-renowned vessel of
infamy, Queen Anne's Revenge.

343
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,695
Blackbeard.

344
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,917
Work!

345
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,456
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.

346
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,254
Zombiefied.

347
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,890
Blackbeard's doing. All
the officers are the same.

348
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,764
Makes 'em more compliant.

349
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,006
And perpetually ill-tempered.

350
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,302
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.

351
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:04,014
Pull! Pull! Pull!

352
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,119
Five days underway, at least.

353
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:15,096
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

354
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,962
Smell of the crew.

355
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,632
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

356
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,800
And how can I make sure to not?

357
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,276
Him? Churchly fellow.

358
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,438
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

359
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,310
Bible-thumper on this ship?

360
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,350
A missionary is his story.

361
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,249
What I heard was he
got captured in a raid.

362
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,256
Rest of the ship got
killed, but not 'im.

363
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,689
First mate wouldn't let it happen

364
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,522
on account of his premier
standing with the Lord.

365
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:49,065
A first mate sticking her
neck out for some prisoner.

366
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,825
That you don't see.

367
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,665
"Her"? First mate is a "her"?

368
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,033
Back to work!

369
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,613
Steady as she goes.

370
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,201
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

371
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,828
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

372
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,771
upon which I am now imprisoned.

373
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,911
We can do this, Jack.

374
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:38,641
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

375
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,881
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

376
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,183
Resurrector of the
dead in his spare time.

377
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,191
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

378
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,228
Maybe to his own daughter?

379
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,701
Daughter as in... beget by?

380
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,403
Long-lost. Recently found.

381
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,374
Who loves her dear
papa with all her soul.

382
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,570
- He bought that?
- I sold that.

383
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,817
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

384
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,822
or him and you, not you and me.

385
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,051
No, Jack, that's the best part.

386
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,253
He will be dead.

387
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,964
You'll be handling that
part yourself, then?

388
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,364
There is a prophecy.

389
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,699
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

390
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,296
Oh, no, no. I've seen a thing or two.

391
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,835
The prophecy is this:

392
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,814
Blackbeard will meet his
death within a fortnight

393
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:50,409
at the hands of a one-legged man.

394
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,750
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

395
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,837
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

396
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,070
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

397
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,943
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

398
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,521
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.

399
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,782
And in the king's
name, we behave as such.

400
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,757
Aye, Captain.

401
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,962
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

402
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,696
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

403
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,508
The Spaniard.

404
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:54,814
All hands! Battle
stations! Get to windward!

405
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:58,012
- All hands, windward!
- Harden up two points!

406
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,592
- Two points!
- Cast loose the cannons!

407
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:09,329
- Gunners, take posts!
- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

408
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:13,335
- Out! Thrust!
- Await orders.

409
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,804
Steady!

410
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,734
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

411
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,077
Sir. Orders, sir?

412
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,423
He never so much as turned his head.

413
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,428
The Fountain is the prize.

414
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,194
It appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.

415
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:48,237
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!

416
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,932
All hands, more sail!

417
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,408
Ride hard between wind and tide!

418
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,983
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

419
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,556
Mutiny most foul.

420
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:14,222
Aye. I signed up to sail under
Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

421
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,627
And a lady, at that.

422
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,961
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

423
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,468
Make my toes curl, they do.

424
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,665
I got 'em. All of them.

425
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,775
- Well done.
- Good lad.

426
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,344
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

427
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,946
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.

428
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,880
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

429
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,216
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.

430
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,555
He must come out sometime.

431
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,620
Not really, no.

432
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,158
Any of you sail with him before?

433
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,765
- No, no.
- I've never.

434
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:49,923
Definitely not.

435
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,935
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

436
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,700
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

437
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,900
no one's seen him...

438
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:03,046
Good news, gentlemen. This
is not Blackbeard's ship.

439
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,011
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

440
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,174
No, this be the Queen
Anne's Revenge, right enough.

441
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,785
How do you know?

442
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:12,184
I've seen the name, on
the back of the ship.

443
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:20,386
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

444
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,260
...you have been monstrously deceived.

445
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:28,532
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.

446
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,608
You've nay been informed
of a destination.

447
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,870
Death lies before us

448
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:38,846
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

449
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,346
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

450
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,616
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.

451
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:50,091
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...

452
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,752
...we take the ship.

453
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,626
We take the ship, then. Now!

454
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,363
Go on, then.

455
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,769
- Help me, shipmates!
- Give it to 'em!

456
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,174
- Wake up! It's ours!
- Come on!

457
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,974
Get up! Off your backside!

458
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,882
- Get off your fannies!
- Take it to them, lads!

459
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,850
Help me! Fight!

460
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,800
Jack.

461
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:38,067
If this is a dream, you can
keep the sword and boots on.

462
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,736
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.

463
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,410
No, it's not!

464
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,281
I thought I should give you fair
warning, we're taking the ship.

465
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,815
Nothing personal.

466
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,794
Think you might be
better off if you just...

467
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,762
...stay out of it.

468
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,653
Boggit.

469
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,544
Wretch!

470
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,167
You're either with us or against us!

471
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,507
I am not with you,
neither am I against you!

472
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,012
Can he do that?

473
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,175
He's religious. I believe it's required.

474
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,824
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!

475
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,039
Take him, men. Tie him down tight!

476
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,518
The ship is ours!

477
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,583
Gentlemen.

478
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,522
I be placed in a bewilderment.

479
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:54,297
There I were, resting,

480
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:59,102
and upon a sudden, I hear
an ungodly row on deck.

481
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,113
Sailors abandon their posts

482
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,773
without orders, without leave.

483
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,116
Men before the mast,

484
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,655
taking the ship for themselves.

485
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,690
What be that, First Mate?

486
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,694
- Mutiny, Captain.
- Again?

487
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,833
- Mutiny!
- Aye.

488
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,096
Mutiny.

489
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,042
And what fate befalls mutineers?

490
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,701
Now, we know the answer
to that, do we not?

491
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:39,440
Mutineers hang!

492
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,995
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

493
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,095
I can name fingers and point names.

494
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,738
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

495
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:39,104
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

496
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,710
Have I mentioned, sir, what
a lovely daughter you have?

497
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,785
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

498
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,353
Remember, Father. We need him.

499
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,979
If I don't kill a man
every now and then,

500
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,525
- they forget who I am.
- Coward!

501
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,392
They do not forget.

502
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,863
Your crew sees you for
the miscreant you are.

503
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,332
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

504
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,870
Twice in one day, I find
myself in a bewilderment.

505
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,132
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

506
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,139
You dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.

507
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,542
No, sir. The truth is it be
much simpler than all that.

508
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,582
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.

509
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,709
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

510
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,447
- No!
- All Latin blood like her mother.

511
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,682
Father, I beg you.

512
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:31,557
There I be again, forgetting
why the missionary is here.

513
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:36,098
My daughter fears for my
soul, or what's left of it.

514
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,764
You truly wish to save me, my child?

515
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,838
Every soul can be saved.

516
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,772
Be that true, young cleric?

517
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,606
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

518
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:54,573
Still, I pray for every unfortunate
soul on this hell-bound vessel.

519
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,783
You disarm me with your faith.

520
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,625
Eight bells!

521
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,752
Which of you unfortunate
souls stood watch?

522
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:10,856
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.

523
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,639
You?

524
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,935
Aye.

525
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,274
Aye.

526
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,403
The cook.

527
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,416
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

528
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,647
Bring her about!

529
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,229
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

530
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,670
Our laws allow the
Captain to show leniency.

531
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,437
I have given this man a
chance to determine his fate,

532
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,240
a gift not afforded to all.

533
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,822
Oh, you now.

534
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,719
Chance to show the
worth of your prayers.

535
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,922
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

536
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,605
Course made!

537
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,606
Stop. Give that man a
chance. Give yourself a...

538
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,930
You know when I feel
closest to our Maker?

539
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,937
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

540
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,599
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

541
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,440
And I see it revealed when in
times of hardship and tragedy,

542
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,878
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

543
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,416
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

544
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,747
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again!

545
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,060
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,

546
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,068
so, if your heart is set,

547
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,400
you may drop me off anywhere you like.

548
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,303
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

549
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,804
Your words surround you like
fog and make you hard to see.

550
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,783
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard?

551
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,684
Beheaded they say. Still, your body swam

552
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:49,292
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.

553
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,020
And here you are, running scared.

554
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:56,099
- Scared.
- To the Fountain.

555
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,259
The Quartermaster sees
things before they happen.

556
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:03,897
He has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.

557
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,373
The threads of destiny woven.

558
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,478
You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

559
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,240
- And you?
- Me?

560
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:15,648
I'm skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.

561
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:21,588
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

562
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,593
I will reach the
Fountain. You will lead me.

563
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:31,023
That knife will serve you no
better than the mutiny you devised.

564
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,965
Mutiny served me well.

565
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,037
It gained me an audience with you.

566
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,268
Aye.

567
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,473
To warn you.

568
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,004
Regarding your first mate,

569
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,048
who pretends to be persons she is not.

570
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,675
Do tell.

571
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,051
She is not your daughter.

572
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,386
You dare to speak thusly
of my flesh and blood?

573
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:04,057
Sir, the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.

574
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:08,661
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

575
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,739
Though I cannot claim credit

576
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,843
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

577
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,337
Angelica. My beloved daughter,

578
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,076
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

579
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,880
and you claim to be the
one who corrupted her?

580
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,048
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

581
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,591
More to be feared than a wild beast.

582
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:34,561
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

583
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,723
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

584
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,028
- Father?
- Sweetness!

585
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,529
No need to hurt him, Father.

586
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,903
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

587
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,774
You see? Even now, she
attends to your welfare,

588
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,474
giving lie to the
claims you make of her.

589
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,552
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

590
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,058
Put another way.

591
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:12,266
If I do not make it to
the Fountain in time...

592
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,896
...neither will you.

593
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:23,172
I'll have a wee look-see at those
charts straight away then, shall I?

594
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,179
Sir.

595
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,420
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,

596
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,957
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

597
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,288
among the crew, as to our destination.

598
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,454
Shut your trap and make way.

599
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:49,098
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect, sir.

600
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,739
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

601
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,808
Whitecap Bay.

602
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,073
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

603
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:02,277
And every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,

604
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,785
though few know why or dare to ask.

605
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,548
Be the stories true?

606
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,520
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

607
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:11,821
or forever leave it to
the wider fields of fancy.

608
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,125
Mermaids, Captain.

609
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,029
Aye. Mermaids.

610
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:22,332
Sea ghouls, devil fish, dreadful
in hunger for flesh of man.

611
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,033
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

612
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,768
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

613
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:31,541
as mermaids be given to take the rest...

614
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,114
...to the bone.

615
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,814
Steady! Steady, men! Find your courage,

616
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,854
or be ready to purpose your fear!

617
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,390
Save yourselves!

618
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,828
- Man overboard!
- Nay! A deserter.

619
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,727
- Come about.
- Nay!

620
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,835
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what

621
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:59,465
that man can deliver, but I do
ask this: Are we not king's men?

622
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,043
Aye.

623
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,942
- On the king's mission?
- Aye.

624
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:08,346
I did not note any fear in the eyes
of the Spanish as they passed us by.

625
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,215
- Are we not king's men?
- Aye!

626
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,289
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

627
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:17,392
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

628
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,395
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

629
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,868
Come.

630
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,310
Little drink?

631
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,712
Wine, music, candlelight.

632
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,081
I think we've traveled
down this road before, Jack.

633
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,052
Yes, we have.

634
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,422
I remember it well.

635
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,095
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

636
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,564
Incessant writhing.

637
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,566
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

638
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,562
La Martinique.

639
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,401
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

640
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,304
Either or.

641
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,135
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

642
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,737
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

643
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:17,114
You can be so charming when
you want something, Jack.

644
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,745
The trick is finding out what.

645
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,950
The truth, then, is it?

646
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,151
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

647
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,628
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,

648
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,825
where we shall bathe one
another in equal shares of fame

649
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:33,993
and other assorted debaucheries.

650
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,129
And I'll tell you the
ritual of the Fountain.

651
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,107
Yes. The profane ritual.

652
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,007
Can I trust you, Jack?

653
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:49,585
- I need you on my side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

654
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:53,144
You and I are as thick as thieves, love.

655
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,520
Tell me the rules.

656
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:01,324
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

657
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,602
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

658
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:10,036
The silver chalices of Ponce de León.

659
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,704
With these items...

660
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,970
- Yes?
- With these items,

661
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:19,513
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

662
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,616
You know what that means.

663
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,655
We cannot go alone, you and I.

664
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,054
The ritual requires a victim.

665
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:34,662
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

666
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,532
I find my desire for the
Fountain greatly lessened.

667
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,564
But there is something
onboard you do want.

668
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,710
What about Blackbeard?

669
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,441
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.

670
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,119
He keeps each ship as a prize.

671
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:11,356
You help me, and I
promise you your pick.

672
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,902
Though I think I know
the one you will choose.

673
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,268
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

674
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,142
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

675
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,787
He's even more annoying in miniature.

676
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:37,950
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

677
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,961
You are not going to steal
the life of some innocent man.

678
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,829
What about the one-legged man?

679
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,730
I need years, Jack.

680
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,975
Not for me. For my father.

681
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,910
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

682
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,110
You've fallen for your own con, love.

683
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,515
No, he is my father.

684
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,381
The lies I told you were not lies.

685
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:10,058
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

686
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,185
- Yes.
- That's very good.

687
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,796
- May I use that?
- I'm sure you will, anyway.

688
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,297
Of course I will.

689
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,130
So, will you not give up this quest?

690
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:23,865
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

691
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,407
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

692
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,311
...he is evil,

693
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,643
and he will kill you given the chance.

694
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,877
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set

695
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,214
the limits on redemption?

696
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:42,688
You stole years of my
life, Jack. You owe me.

697
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,886
And you are en route to
getting yourself killed,

698
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,360
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

699
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:52,229
Whitecap Bay!

700
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,832
All hands on deck! Set to the longboats!

701
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,838
Lay 'em out flat!

702
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:11,317
No tangles. Make 'em look
pretty for our dainty guests.

703
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:15,254
We're gonna need light. A lot of light.

704
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,050
Come!

705
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:45,082
Smell that? Whale oil. Stuff
burns like a miracle from God.

706
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:48,952
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.

707
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,217
Let's not get our hopes up.

708
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,205
The old moon in the arms of the new one.

709
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,567
First of the summer.

710
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,706
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

711
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:24,893
We're doomed. They be
drawn to man-made light.

712
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,724
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.

713
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,389
There'll be mermaids
upon us within the hour,

714
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:33,991
you mark my words. And we're the bait.

715
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:42,304
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.

716
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:46,313
Don't be a fool! Mermaids
are all female, son,

717
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,247
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

718
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:53,651
But when it comes time to
churn butter, so to speak,

719
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,781
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

720
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,951
or off the deck of a
ship, have their way,

721
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:04,032
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.

722
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,925
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

723
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,832
- Sing.
- What?

724
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,336
They like to hear singing.

725
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:23,277
My name is Maria

726
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:26,582
A merchant's daughter fair

727
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:30,318
- Louder.
- And I have left my parents

728
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,657
And 3,000 pounds a year

729
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,822
My heart is pierced by Cupid

730
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,402
I disdain all glittering gold

731
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,028
There is nothing can console me

732
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:47,074
But my jolly sailor bold

733
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,804
My heart is pierced by Cupid

734
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:56,646
I disdain all glittering gold

735
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:59,516
There is nothing can console me

736
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:04,150
But my jolly sailor bold

737
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:23,569
Lord save me.

738
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,308
Man, look. Look there.

739
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,246
You'll scare her off!

740
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,912
Aye, and good riddance!

741
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,590
Can you talk?

742
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,795
Yes.

743
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,809
You're beautiful.

744
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:58,410
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

745
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,751
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

746
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:08,215
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself!

747
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,549
Boys! There ain't much been given to me

748
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:14,094
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.

749
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,959
But, by God, I'll have it said

750
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:19,500
that Scrum had himself a
kiss from a proper mermaid!

751
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:24,402
My heart is pierced by Cupid

752
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:28,067
I disdain all glittering gold

753
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:31,612
There is nothing can console me

754
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,844
But my jolly sailor bold

755
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,845
Come all ye pretty fair maids

756
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,252
Whoever you may be

757
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,955
Who love a jolly sailor bold

758
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,831
That ploughs the raging sea

759
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,100
My heart is pierced by Cupid

760
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:02,439
I disdain all glittering gold

761
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:06,776
There is nothing can console me

762
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:11,285
But my jolly sailor bold

763
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,551
My heart is pierced by Cupid

764
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,957
I disdain all glittering gold

765
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:24,157
There is nothing can console me

766
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,134
But my jolly sailor bold

767
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,266
Out upon it! It has begun!

768
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,051
Light 'em up!

769
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:55,749
Muster your courage! Drive 'em to shore!

770
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:09,638
Nets into the water! Quickly!

771
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:02,522
Retreat, all, to land! For your lives!

772
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,294
Retreat, I say!

773
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,455
Cowards! Back in the water!

774
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:13,796
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

775
01:08:23,256 --> 01:08:25,417
We got one!

776
01:08:29,696 --> 01:08:31,061
I'm in love!

777
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,233
Check the wounded!

778
01:08:35,368 --> 01:08:38,166
See if you can find
one mermaid still alive!

779
01:09:17,443 --> 01:09:18,603
Come, give a hand!

780
01:09:19,846 --> 01:09:21,871
Well done, sailor.

781
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:24,476
Did everyone see that?

782
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,675
Because I will not be doing it again.

783
01:09:26,786 --> 01:09:31,485
Back to the ship. We head
for a protected cove. Now.

784
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:51,276
- Lord. Is that?
- Mermaid.

785
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:54,938
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

786
01:09:55,815 --> 01:09:56,839
Ever walk on the beach,

787
01:09:57,016 --> 01:09:59,280
look back and see your
footsteps in the sand?

788
01:09:59,419 --> 01:10:03,412
It's like that, except the
footsteps lie before me.

789
01:10:03,556 --> 01:10:07,390
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.

790
01:10:07,493 --> 01:10:09,120
We must hasten.

791
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,797
We travel by foot. Gibbs,
I require a heading.

792
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:24,103
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.

793
01:10:24,243 --> 01:10:27,337
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?

794
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,814
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

795
01:10:31,951 --> 01:10:34,010
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

796
01:10:36,789 --> 01:10:40,486
Seagulls... nesting.

797
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:43,686
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?

798
01:10:52,338 --> 01:10:53,896
My God.

799
01:10:54,073 --> 01:10:56,098
Your head or my heading.

800
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:58,439
I'll have me one or
t'other, I don't care which.

801
01:11:03,616 --> 01:11:05,880
All hands, forward!

802
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:25,828
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

803
01:11:25,972 --> 01:11:28,600
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

804
01:11:28,774 --> 01:11:33,473
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.

805
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:35,342
What I want first...

806
01:11:38,885 --> 01:11:40,944
...is Ponce De León's ship.

807
01:12:18,057 --> 01:12:19,888
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

808
01:12:20,026 --> 01:12:23,257
Because tears don't
keep. We need them fresh.

809
01:12:23,396 --> 01:12:26,126
What is the ritual again?

810
01:12:26,265 --> 01:12:28,733
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

811
01:12:28,868 --> 01:12:30,392
And two silver chalices.

812
01:12:30,536 --> 01:12:33,198
One cup with a tear, one without.

813
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,874
So, one with a tear and water in both?

814
01:12:36,976 --> 01:12:38,534
Quite complicated, is it not?

815
01:12:38,644 --> 01:12:41,738
Both get water. One gets a tear.

816
01:12:41,881 --> 01:12:44,543
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

817
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:47,141
gets all the years of
life from the other.

818
01:12:48,321 --> 01:12:50,414
How many years?

819
01:12:51,857 --> 01:12:54,826
All the years that they have lived,

820
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:58,488
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

821
01:13:07,807 --> 01:13:09,104
Clergyman.

822
01:13:11,077 --> 01:13:14,012
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

823
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:15,704
I would like it noted here and now

824
01:13:15,881 --> 01:13:19,112
that I am fully prepared to
believe in whatever I must,

825
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:21,014
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

826
01:13:21,153 --> 01:13:23,587
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

827
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:27,352
We have a word for that,
Jack. You can convert.

828
01:13:27,493 --> 01:13:29,984
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

829
01:13:33,966 --> 01:13:35,263
Quartermaster!

830
01:13:35,835 --> 01:13:37,598
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe!

831
01:13:37,703 --> 01:13:40,797
- She has water.
- She needs air!

832
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:46,678
- Open this.
- She will escape.

833
01:13:46,812 --> 01:13:50,543
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.

834
01:13:59,058 --> 01:14:00,150
See?

835
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:06,892
Onward.

836
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:34,548
Just as I thought. Not this way!

837
01:14:36,629 --> 01:14:38,062
This is the way, isn't it?

838
01:14:38,197 --> 01:14:41,030
'Course it is, but we
should go around to the east.

839
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:43,032
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

840
01:14:43,169 --> 01:14:44,932
- Well, then we'll circle back.
- There is no time.

841
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:46,732
You're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.

842
01:14:46,872 --> 01:14:48,863
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.

843
01:14:49,008 --> 01:14:51,101
- You would know.
- Someone must go.

844
01:14:52,178 --> 01:14:53,702
You mean split up?

845
01:14:53,846 --> 01:14:56,747
You mean jump? This
I cannot wait to see.

846
01:14:56,882 --> 01:15:00,875
Sparrow will go. Find the
ship, retrieve the chalices.

847
01:15:01,053 --> 01:15:03,021
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

848
01:15:03,122 --> 01:15:06,387
Yes, what makes you
think he will come back?

849
01:15:06,525 --> 01:15:09,016
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.

850
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:11,591
She'll go.

851
01:15:15,601 --> 01:15:16,966
How much farther to the Fountain?

852
01:15:17,103 --> 01:15:18,798
I'm running out of time.

853
01:15:20,773 --> 01:15:22,934
About a day's march north,
following that river,

854
01:15:23,075 --> 01:15:26,567
you'll get to a series of
pools. Then you're close.

855
01:15:29,048 --> 01:15:30,310
You will go.

856
01:15:33,219 --> 01:15:35,517
I was sure it would come to this.

857
01:15:49,101 --> 01:15:53,265
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

858
01:15:53,405 --> 01:15:55,339
Sudden urge to jump?

859
01:15:57,243 --> 01:15:58,801
I don't have it.

860
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:01,737
I need those chalices.

861
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:04,338
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

862
01:16:04,483 --> 01:16:07,543
You will go. You will return...

863
01:16:08,854 --> 01:16:10,845
...or I will kill her.

864
01:16:13,659 --> 01:16:15,183
You won't kill your own daughter.

865
01:16:15,327 --> 01:16:18,125
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

866
01:16:18,264 --> 01:16:19,856
remove the shot from all but two,

867
01:16:19,999 --> 01:16:22,490
but do not tell me which two.

868
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:27,364
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

869
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:31,336
No.

870
01:16:33,546 --> 01:16:34,570
No.

871
01:16:37,683 --> 01:16:40,516
- Yes.
- You're sure?

872
01:16:40,653 --> 01:16:42,120
'Course I am.

873
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:51,387
Again.

874
01:16:52,898 --> 01:16:55,458
Please, they're not even loaded.

875
01:17:00,372 --> 01:17:01,669
Again.

876
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:04,408
If you're so keen on killing her,

877
01:17:04,543 --> 01:17:06,943
- why don't you just let her jump?
- What?

878
01:17:07,713 --> 01:17:10,204
If you jump and die,

879
01:17:10,349 --> 01:17:14,012
then she will have her chance.

880
01:17:14,153 --> 01:17:15,620
Again.

881
01:17:18,858 --> 01:17:20,758
Oi...

882
01:17:20,893 --> 01:17:24,761
...if I jump, will I survive?

883
01:17:27,066 --> 01:17:28,431
The doll.

884
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:49,517
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense! I'm going!

885
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,471
Wet. Wet again.

886
01:18:13,779 --> 01:18:16,680
We go on. Due north to the Fountain.

887
01:18:17,516 --> 01:18:18,881
Well played, Father.

888
01:18:20,619 --> 01:18:22,951
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

889
01:18:25,658 --> 01:18:27,649
Of course, my love.

890
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:40,033
Be nice to have a map about now.

891
01:18:40,205 --> 01:18:41,832
Or a ship.

892
01:18:42,574 --> 01:18:46,305
Stop! Hold very still.

893
01:18:47,746 --> 01:18:51,273
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

894
01:18:59,992 --> 01:19:03,257
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

895
01:19:03,362 --> 01:19:05,922
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

896
01:19:06,031 --> 01:19:08,261
- Push on!
- You can sleep when you're dead.

897
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:09,595
Push on!

898
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:14,537
Fortune continues to favor us.

899
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:44,531
The Santiago.

900
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:47,400
Famously captained by Ponce de León.

901
01:19:50,175 --> 01:19:51,642
There's no one there.

902
01:19:51,744 --> 01:19:52,768
Right, then.

903
01:20:27,446 --> 01:20:28,879
We must not stop.

904
01:20:36,889 --> 01:20:38,686
You will walk.

905
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,971
I cannot.

906
01:21:00,112 --> 01:21:01,909
Walk or die.

907
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:09,581
Put your arms around me.

908
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:13,122
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.

909
01:21:30,042 --> 01:21:34,342
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.

910
01:21:53,665 --> 01:21:55,428
Hold here 'til I say!

911
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,345
Such beauty.

912
01:22:10,482 --> 01:22:13,815
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

913
01:22:13,952 --> 01:22:16,887
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

914
01:22:17,022 --> 01:22:19,320
who found no refuge on the Ark.

915
01:22:22,094 --> 01:22:24,221
Such beauty...

916
01:22:25,497 --> 01:22:27,124
...and yet deadly.

917
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,558
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

918
01:22:31,703 --> 01:22:36,663
No. You are different.

919
01:22:37,576 --> 01:22:38,804
Different?

920
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:42,938
Are you not? You protect.

921
01:22:46,351 --> 01:22:47,409
Did you?

922
01:22:49,054 --> 01:22:51,852
You pushed me down out of the way.

923
01:22:52,991 --> 01:22:57,485
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.

924
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:59,895
Bring the creature. Cover its head.

925
01:23:00,032 --> 01:23:02,023
She has a name!

926
01:23:06,538 --> 01:23:08,062
Pray tell.

927
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:16,179
She is Syrena.

928
01:23:57,122 --> 01:23:58,646
Ponce de León.

929
01:24:02,327 --> 01:24:06,024
If 40 pirates dreamt
40 nights of treasure,

930
01:24:06,198 --> 01:24:09,759
it would not match the
contents of this room.

931
01:24:09,901 --> 01:24:11,459
You.

932
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,036
- You.
- No...

933
01:24:17,209 --> 01:24:19,473
...you.
- I was here first.

934
01:24:19,611 --> 01:24:23,638
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.

935
01:24:23,782 --> 01:24:26,273
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices

936
01:24:26,418 --> 01:24:29,785
- for my royal liege.
- Oh, please.

937
01:24:31,023 --> 01:24:32,820
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

938
01:24:34,793 --> 01:24:37,387
The whole ship will slide!

939
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,793
Right, then.

940
01:24:42,934 --> 01:24:48,873
What if we each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?

941
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:52,977
Put it back!

942
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:56,538
We touch nothing!

943
01:25:04,456 --> 01:25:05,423
What about that?

944
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:07,956
The chalices.

945
01:25:09,661 --> 01:25:11,185
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

946
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:13,025
Fine, then.

947
01:25:32,284 --> 01:25:33,842
- Together.
- Together.

948
01:25:36,555 --> 01:25:37,579
Rocks.

949
01:25:38,657 --> 01:25:40,022
The Spanish.

950
01:25:40,726 --> 01:25:42,421
They're ahead of us, mate.

951
01:25:43,328 --> 01:25:46,593
I shall have a look at that
map. If it's what I fear...

952
01:25:56,675 --> 01:25:58,905
I wonder why they left this behind.

953
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,680
Don't touch the map.

954
01:26:11,022 --> 01:26:12,114
They know the path,

955
01:26:12,257 --> 01:26:16,159
but I can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.

956
01:26:29,608 --> 01:26:30,939
Jack!

957
01:26:34,112 --> 01:26:38,276
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out of jail.

958
01:26:40,218 --> 01:26:41,742
You stole my map.

959
01:26:42,287 --> 01:26:44,755
Right. Best be started.

960
01:26:47,793 --> 01:26:49,317
Ol?

961
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:08,201
Mermaids.

962
01:27:11,049 --> 01:27:13,984
Careful, these pools run deep.

963
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:17,680
If she escapes, all
is lost. Quartermaster.

964
01:27:19,324 --> 01:27:22,623
Look. Look!

965
01:27:24,196 --> 01:27:27,165
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

966
01:27:27,299 --> 01:27:30,894
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

967
01:27:31,069 --> 01:27:35,233
but just enough to make the dying slow.

968
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:37,465
Think on it.

969
01:27:37,609 --> 01:27:41,010
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

970
01:27:41,146 --> 01:27:45,480
Syrena, won't you cry?

971
01:27:46,351 --> 01:27:48,182
All die, even you.

972
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,778
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...

973
01:27:53,825 --> 01:27:55,690
Listen.

974
01:27:55,827 --> 01:27:59,160
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

975
01:27:59,297 --> 01:28:01,731
Do you not hear them?

976
01:28:02,767 --> 01:28:05,565
We need but one tear.

977
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,737
Vile creature!

978
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:12,469
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!
- Choke her!

979
01:28:12,577 --> 01:28:15,205
Cut out the tears from behind the eyes!

980
01:28:15,347 --> 01:28:16,678
Where's your voice in this?

981
01:28:17,549 --> 01:28:20,575
Maybe she'll have a change
of heart when the sun rises.

982
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:24,621
Oh, aye, she will burn, but
I cannot wait for the sun.

983
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:26,484
Perhaps we should build a fire.

984
01:28:26,591 --> 01:28:28,752
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.

985
01:28:28,894 --> 01:28:31,954
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.

986
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:35,258
I will tear every scale from
her body one by one if I see fit.

987
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,958
If that displeases you, go pray.

988
01:28:37,135 --> 01:28:40,229
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

989
01:28:40,372 --> 01:28:43,239
Behold, gentlemen, a
man formerly of faith.

990
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:46,276
That vile creature, as you call
her, is worth a hundred of you.

991
01:28:46,411 --> 01:28:48,174
Oh, you care for her?

992
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:52,206
You fancy her.

993
01:28:53,885 --> 01:28:56,615
And do not deny what
is clear to my eyes.

994
01:28:58,423 --> 01:28:59,549
Question is...

995
01:29:02,727 --> 01:29:04,718
...does she fancy you?

996
01:29:06,965 --> 01:29:10,560
By God, she does. We are in luck!

997
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,870
Bring forth a tear...

998
01:29:15,373 --> 01:29:17,898
...or witness the
death of this poor soul.

999
01:29:20,045 --> 01:29:23,481
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

1000
01:29:23,615 --> 01:29:25,207
I would be grateful.

1001
01:29:26,551 --> 01:29:28,143
Sadness, yes,

1002
01:29:28,286 --> 01:29:33,690
- but no sorrow... yet.
- Not by your hand, Father!

1003
01:29:33,858 --> 01:29:36,486
Time and tide wait for
none. Quartermaster.

1004
01:29:48,807 --> 01:29:52,299
Aye, mermaids are tough.

1005
01:29:52,444 --> 01:29:54,469
The lot of them.

1006
01:29:54,613 --> 01:29:59,016
Tie her up like the
others. And get rid of this.

1007
01:30:03,588 --> 01:30:06,580
- You are confident?
- Yes.

1008
01:30:06,691 --> 01:30:09,683
I am a woman. So is she.

1009
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:20,728
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

1010
01:30:21,806 --> 01:30:23,603
There is a girl...

1011
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:26,939
...a female... of the opposite sex.

1012
01:30:27,045 --> 01:30:31,004
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel."

1013
01:30:31,149 --> 01:30:34,175
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

1014
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:37,550
Yes, but it's just that I
may have caused said damsel

1015
01:30:37,689 --> 01:30:41,284
- some manner of harm many moons ago.
- Out with it.

1016
01:30:41,393 --> 01:30:44,726
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

1017
01:30:44,863 --> 01:30:48,765
Ah, you pretended to love her, then
you left her and broke her heart.

1018
01:30:48,933 --> 01:30:53,632
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

1019
01:30:55,807 --> 01:30:58,970
...stirrings.
- Stirrings?

1020
01:30:59,077 --> 01:31:03,070
- Stirrings.
- What? Like feelings, you mean?

1021
01:31:03,214 --> 01:31:06,240
No, no, no. Not quite all the
way to feelings. More like...

1022
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:11,982
All right, feelings, damn you.

1023
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:16,789
And you left her still. That's low.

1024
01:31:18,229 --> 01:31:19,457
Thank you.

1025
01:31:26,371 --> 01:31:27,804
Stealth over force.

1026
01:31:27,972 --> 01:31:31,703
I'll take it from here on
account of your condition.

1027
01:31:32,844 --> 01:31:34,709
You don't have termites, do you?

1028
01:31:34,846 --> 01:31:36,814
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

1029
01:31:36,981 --> 01:31:39,472
but I'll be keeping you
company all the same.

1030
01:31:39,651 --> 01:31:42,711
Hold here, Lieutenant
Commander. Wait for my signal.

1031
01:32:14,686 --> 01:32:16,779
There. That one. That be the leader.

1032
01:32:16,921 --> 01:32:19,412
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

1033
01:32:20,892 --> 01:32:25,124
No, wait. By God, that
must be them right there.

1034
01:32:28,633 --> 01:32:30,863
Your sword smells funny.

1035
01:32:31,035 --> 01:32:35,938
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

1036
01:32:36,074 --> 01:32:39,168
Just a scratch, you're
a dead man in minutes.

1037
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:41,642
Would you mind pointing
it the other way?

1038
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,543
I don't like toads.

1039
01:32:48,419 --> 01:32:51,855
- What are you doing?
- Planning an escape route.

1040
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:56,086
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.

1041
01:32:56,194 --> 01:32:59,322
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

1042
01:33:26,324 --> 01:33:27,814
Now what?

1043
01:33:28,693 --> 01:33:31,218
We stroll out, slow and steady.

1044
01:33:31,362 --> 01:33:33,193
Just like we belong.

1045
01:34:32,624 --> 01:34:36,890
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.

1046
01:34:37,028 --> 01:34:41,226
- Yes.
- You came for me.

1047
01:34:43,067 --> 01:34:44,591
Why?

1048
01:34:46,704 --> 01:34:49,002
You're different, are you not?

1049
01:34:51,209 --> 01:34:55,578
Do you know not of kindness? Compassion?

1050
01:35:12,764 --> 01:35:14,755
Tears of sorrow, never.

1051
01:35:14,899 --> 01:35:17,333
Mermaids be too tough for that.

1052
01:35:17,468 --> 01:35:19,629
But tears of joy...

1053
01:35:21,139 --> 01:35:23,573
They say these be the
more potent anyway.

1054
01:35:23,675 --> 01:35:26,667
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

1055
01:35:27,946 --> 01:35:29,379
Let her go. You don't need her now.

1056
01:35:29,547 --> 01:35:32,482
Let her go? No.

1057
01:35:32,617 --> 01:35:35,609
Secure her bonds. We
leave her with her own.

1058
01:35:45,163 --> 01:35:47,154
How's that escape route working?

1059
01:35:47,298 --> 01:35:50,267
Here's your chance to improvise.

1060
01:35:50,368 --> 01:35:51,699
I'm attempting it.

1061
01:35:51,836 --> 01:35:54,669
I might be able to get a hand loose.

1062
01:35:54,806 --> 01:35:57,070
Oh, you got a knife. That's very good.

1063
01:35:58,176 --> 01:35:59,700
Better.

1064
01:36:05,149 --> 01:36:06,411
I want one of those.

1065
01:36:11,122 --> 01:36:15,354
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

1066
01:36:15,493 --> 01:36:19,953
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.

1067
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:21,497
If you wanted the chalices,

1068
01:36:21,632 --> 01:36:24,328
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

1069
01:36:24,469 --> 01:36:27,632
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

1070
01:36:29,607 --> 01:36:32,838
King George. Privateer. Wig.

1071
01:36:33,978 --> 01:36:35,411
Cheap theatrical facade.

1072
01:36:35,546 --> 01:36:38,413
- I'm not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.

1073
01:36:38,549 --> 01:36:42,383
- When the Pearl was lost?
- Taken, not lost.

1074
01:36:44,989 --> 01:36:49,119
We were off the coast of Hispaniola
when we came under attack.

1075
01:36:49,293 --> 01:36:52,729
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

1076
01:36:52,864 --> 01:36:55,526
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1077
01:36:56,667 --> 01:36:59,898
And then the sea beneath
the Pearl began to roil.

1078
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:03,873
The Pearl was pitching
and yawing violently.

1079
01:37:04,008 --> 01:37:05,873
Every plank, every rail,

1080
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:08,877
every spar, all at once, began to creak.

1081
01:37:09,013 --> 01:37:12,039
The rigging had come to life.

1082
01:37:12,183 --> 01:37:14,879
Our own ship turned against us...

1083
01:37:15,019 --> 01:37:18,284
...tangling the crew, wrapping
around 'em like snakes.

1084
01:37:18,423 --> 01:37:20,823
And wrapping around me leg.

1085
01:37:20,992 --> 01:37:23,392
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

1086
01:37:23,528 --> 01:37:27,055
I am the master of me
ship, not Blackbeard.

1087
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:30,690
I am the master of my
fate, not Blackbeard.

1088
01:37:31,702 --> 01:37:34,068
So I did what needed done.

1089
01:37:40,912 --> 01:37:42,846
I survived.

1090
01:37:44,415 --> 01:37:48,613
So... you're not after the Fountain.

1091
01:37:48,753 --> 01:37:52,416
I care not for King
George or tavern yarns

1092
01:37:52,557 --> 01:37:54,787
that give hope for a healed limb.

1093
01:37:56,427 --> 01:38:00,090
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

1094
01:38:00,298 --> 01:38:03,267
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm

1095
01:38:03,401 --> 01:38:08,065
to drive my poisoned
blade through his heart.

1096
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,474
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

1097
01:39:30,221 --> 01:39:31,552
The prisoner's escaping.

1098
01:39:38,829 --> 01:39:41,525
He's escaping! Fan out! Find him!

1099
01:39:41,666 --> 01:39:42,758
Go! Go!

1100
01:39:44,835 --> 01:39:47,702
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

1101
01:39:55,913 --> 01:39:57,881
I figured that was the signal.

1102
01:40:40,958 --> 01:40:44,450
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is soon upon us.

1103
01:40:46,197 --> 01:40:49,132
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack,
but I've an appointment to keep.

1104
01:40:49,267 --> 01:40:52,259
- I'll not be going back.
- No need.

1105
01:40:52,403 --> 01:40:55,429
- Shall we have a drink?
- We'll drink at the Fountain.

1106
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:17,352
How is it we can never meet without
you pointing something at me?

1107
01:41:18,562 --> 01:41:20,462
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

1108
01:41:20,598 --> 01:41:23,192
Aye. Oi!

1109
01:41:26,671 --> 01:41:29,799
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

1110
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:33,171
And the one-legged
man, he is near. Aye?

1111
01:41:33,311 --> 01:41:34,710
Aye.

1112
01:41:35,513 --> 01:41:36,537
Now...

1113
01:41:36,681 --> 01:41:39,514
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

1114
01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:41,709
- Name them.
- Firstly,

1115
01:41:41,852 --> 01:41:44,218
I'll be having me compass
back. No, no, that's secondly.

1116
01:41:44,355 --> 01:41:46,619
Firstly, upon your word,

1117
01:41:46,724 --> 01:41:48,715
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

1118
01:41:48,859 --> 01:41:51,225
I'll make no vows to the
likes of you, Sparrow.

1119
01:41:51,362 --> 01:41:53,830
But it costs me nothing to admit

1120
01:41:53,964 --> 01:41:56,831
that she was never in harm's way.

1121
01:41:57,468 --> 01:41:59,663
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

1122
01:41:59,804 --> 01:42:01,431
I will be having me compass back.

1123
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:04,365
Please? I do deserve it.

1124
01:42:04,508 --> 01:42:08,000
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?

1125
01:42:08,145 --> 01:42:10,511
Not the big one, the four-legged one.

1126
01:42:13,951 --> 01:42:17,717
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1127
01:42:17,855 --> 01:42:20,551
there are times, not very often,

1128
01:42:20,691 --> 01:42:23,785
when I do reflect upon
my heinous misdeeds.

1129
01:42:23,961 --> 01:42:28,227
Chief among them, I note how
poorly I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

1130
01:42:28,366 --> 01:42:31,028
- my loyal first mate.
- Aye! Now you bring it up...

1131
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:33,864
Left him to rot in
jail, I did. Didn't care.

1132
01:42:34,004 --> 01:42:38,668
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

1133
01:42:40,511 --> 01:42:43,878
- Is that it?
- I think so.

1134
01:42:44,014 --> 01:42:46,608
Quick, or the pig runs, and
good luck getting those chalices.

1135
01:42:46,751 --> 01:42:48,218
Jack, if it's all the same
to you, I'd be just as...

1136
01:42:48,352 --> 01:42:49,683
Done.

1137
01:42:49,787 --> 01:42:51,015
Release the swine.

1138
01:42:56,794 --> 01:43:00,059
Perhaps, if you don't mind, I could
tag along with you folk for a...

1139
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,064
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1140
01:43:11,742 --> 01:43:14,609
I could have swore it was
somewhere right around here.

1141
01:44:44,702 --> 01:44:47,068
We must not stop.

1142
01:45:04,388 --> 01:45:05,821
Dead end.

1143
01:45:06,824 --> 01:45:08,758
Dead. End.

1144
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:10,859
Dead end.

1145
01:45:11,896 --> 01:45:14,865
Jack, I'm starting to think you
don't know where you're going.

1146
01:45:15,666 --> 01:45:18,499
It is not the destination so
much as the journey, they say.

1147
01:45:19,703 --> 01:45:21,170
Chalices, if you please.

1148
01:45:33,183 --> 01:45:34,707
Stand back.

1149
01:45:57,074 --> 01:45:58,632
Jack...

1150
01:45:58,776 --> 01:46:00,710
...have you ever, in fact...

1151
01:46:00,844 --> 01:46:06,339
...seen with your own
eyes... the Fountain of Youth?

1152
01:46:06,517 --> 01:46:08,678
I'm sorry, could you
repeat the question, please?

1153
01:46:08,852 --> 01:46:10,319
Quartermaster.

1154
01:46:11,255 --> 01:46:12,222
No, no!

1155
01:46:15,893 --> 01:46:18,020
Wait, wait! Wait.

1156
01:46:21,298 --> 01:46:25,758
"Aqua... de Vida."

1157
01:47:05,109 --> 01:47:07,634
Master Scrum...

1158
01:47:07,778 --> 01:47:10,645
...do you mind?
- Squire?

1159
01:48:09,339 --> 01:48:11,330
So beautiful.

1160
01:48:50,814 --> 01:48:53,442
Sparrow, I'll be the first
to taste those waters.

1161
01:48:57,921 --> 01:48:59,513
Father.

1162
01:49:02,793 --> 01:49:05,091
The one-legged man.

1163
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:11,590
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?

1164
01:49:11,735 --> 01:49:13,828
Edward Teach!

1165
01:49:13,971 --> 01:49:17,270
For crimes committed on the high seas,

1166
01:49:17,407 --> 01:49:21,275
by the authority granted me
by His Majesty the King...

1167
01:49:21,411 --> 01:49:24,608
...and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...

1168
01:49:24,748 --> 01:49:27,808
...I hereby place you in
the custody of the court,

1169
01:49:27,951 --> 01:49:31,284
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1170
01:49:32,322 --> 01:49:35,849
My trick's out, is that it?

1171
01:49:35,993 --> 01:49:40,430
Such crimes do include, but are
not limited to, piracy, treason,

1172
01:49:40,531 --> 01:49:44,695
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,

1173
01:49:44,835 --> 01:49:48,771
including the brutal theft of one
used, twisted, hairy right leg.

1174
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:54,239
You... dare face this sword?

1175
01:49:54,411 --> 01:49:56,845
This far away from your ship? Aye.

1176
01:49:56,980 --> 01:50:01,713
Aye. That be the cold breath
of fate I feel down my nape.

1177
01:50:01,852 --> 01:50:07,518
But I'll have one last fight, by God.

1178
01:50:07,658 --> 01:50:09,387
Kill 'em all!

1179
01:50:11,028 --> 01:50:12,825
Hang on a minute.

1180
01:50:12,963 --> 01:50:16,865
I just... I just need
to understand something.

1181
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,367
Right, so, you will fight against them,

1182
01:50:20,504 --> 01:50:21,835
they will fight against you.

1183
01:50:21,972 --> 01:50:25,669
All on account of him
wanting to kill him?

1184
01:50:25,809 --> 01:50:29,745
Where is the sense? Exactly.

1185
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:33,611
I say, let them fight each
other while we lay back,

1186
01:50:33,784 --> 01:50:37,220
watch, have a drink, place some wagers!

1187
01:50:38,322 --> 01:50:39,619
Aye.

1188
01:50:42,192 --> 01:50:43,819
- Kill 'em!
- No quarter!

1189
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:15,952
Get off me!

1190
01:51:48,926 --> 01:51:49,950
Scrum, the chalices!

1191
01:51:52,095 --> 01:51:53,221
And the tear! Follow!

1192
01:51:57,234 --> 01:51:58,428
Fight!

1193
01:51:59,336 --> 01:52:02,897
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.

1194
01:52:03,006 --> 01:52:05,338
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you.

1195
01:52:10,881 --> 01:52:13,281
Hand it over. There's a good lad.

1196
01:52:16,653 --> 01:52:20,384
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.

1197
01:52:20,557 --> 01:52:24,789
I told you, I need years.
And now, yours will do.

1198
01:52:32,703 --> 01:52:33,931
Scrum!

1199
01:52:55,592 --> 01:52:57,059
Syrena...

1200
01:53:00,797 --> 01:53:03,561
Oh God, you will not take her.

1201
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:08,660
If you have taken her,
you will give her back.

1202
01:53:08,805 --> 01:53:11,171
Give her back...

1203
01:53:11,308 --> 01:53:14,175
Give her back, please. Please.

1204
01:53:37,768 --> 01:53:40,532
I expected fate to put
up more of a fight, eh?

1205
01:53:57,387 --> 01:54:01,187
I will not have that smile on
your face as I strike you down.

1206
01:54:02,592 --> 01:54:05,686
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

1207
01:54:36,226 --> 01:54:39,525
This land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name

1208
01:54:39,696 --> 01:54:42,256
of His Majesty King George...

1209
01:54:48,505 --> 01:54:51,440
Someone make a note
of that man's bravery.

1210
01:54:58,415 --> 01:55:02,146
Señorita, the chalices, por favor.

1211
01:55:18,835 --> 01:55:24,501
Only God can grant eternal
life, not this pagan water.

1212
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:39,044
Men, destroy this profane temple!

1213
01:55:41,791 --> 01:55:43,122
The Fountain!

1214
01:55:57,174 --> 01:55:58,698
You are a fool.

1215
01:55:58,842 --> 01:56:02,141
You seek in this place
what only faith can provide.

1216
01:56:02,245 --> 01:56:04,805
Faith? In faith, there
is light enough to see

1217
01:56:04,915 --> 01:56:07,179
but darkness enough to blind.

1218
01:56:10,787 --> 01:56:13,051
What devilry is this?

1219
01:56:17,027 --> 01:56:19,621
- For the Pearl.
- What have you done?

1220
01:56:23,166 --> 01:56:25,566
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

1221
01:56:30,207 --> 01:56:32,539
I'm not such the fool
to take on Blackbeard

1222
01:56:32,676 --> 01:56:36,077
without a little venomous advantage.

1223
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:38,870
Jack!

1224
01:56:50,694 --> 01:56:52,753
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1225
01:56:52,896 --> 01:56:56,332
and this sword, payment
for my missing limb!

1226
01:57:10,747 --> 01:57:12,146
Hang on! Pull!

1227
01:57:57,427 --> 01:57:59,793
Do not waste my tear.

1228
01:58:29,259 --> 01:58:31,386
Drink this. This one has the tear.

1229
01:58:31,528 --> 01:58:33,519
- You must drink the other.
- No!

1230
01:58:34,297 --> 01:58:37,528
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.

1231
01:58:38,468 --> 01:58:41,562
You take it, Father, for your soul.

1232
01:58:43,606 --> 01:58:49,044
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.

1233
01:58:50,213 --> 01:58:53,011
This one takes life?

1234
01:58:53,149 --> 01:58:55,014
This one has the tear and gives life?

1235
01:58:55,151 --> 01:58:56,413
Aye, hurry!

1236
01:59:05,328 --> 01:59:09,594
Angelica... Save me, my child.

1237
01:59:11,501 --> 01:59:12,934
No.

1238
01:59:21,644 --> 01:59:23,077
I love you, Father.

1239
01:59:36,059 --> 01:59:37,686
Wait a minute.

1240
01:59:39,863 --> 01:59:42,696
In fact, it might have
been the other way around.

1241
01:59:43,533 --> 01:59:47,367
This cup had the tear,
that one had the other bit.

1242
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:48,732
Trickster!

1243
01:59:48,872 --> 01:59:50,737
- Devil!
- Father!

1244
01:59:57,747 --> 01:59:59,271
You bastard! How could you?

1245
02:00:00,283 --> 02:00:01,750
Your father saved you.

1246
02:00:01,885 --> 02:00:04,410
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1247
02:01:05,215 --> 02:01:07,342
You are hurt.

1248
02:01:09,552 --> 02:01:11,486
In body only.

1249
02:01:13,156 --> 02:01:17,388
My mind is at peace... because of you.

1250
02:01:18,461 --> 02:01:21,328
- Me?
- Yes.

1251
02:01:22,332 --> 02:01:24,732
I was lost.

1252
02:01:25,702 --> 02:01:30,366
The wind, the tides...

1253
02:01:30,507 --> 02:01:33,567
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1254
02:01:35,144 --> 02:01:37,078
But for me, only you.

1255
02:01:37,981 --> 02:01:41,712
Philip, I can save you.

1256
02:01:41,851 --> 02:01:44,820
You need only ask.

1257
02:01:46,256 --> 02:01:51,057
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

1258
02:01:52,061 --> 02:01:54,427
Forgiveness.

1259
02:01:54,564 --> 02:01:57,897
If not for me, you would
never have been captured.

1260
02:01:58,034 --> 02:01:59,695
Ask.

1261
02:02:01,571 --> 02:02:03,402
Forgive me?

1262
02:02:28,531 --> 02:02:29,759
I hate you.

1263
02:02:29,899 --> 02:02:32,231
The bloke who saved your life?

1264
02:02:32,368 --> 02:02:35,565
The years I possess,
stolen from my own father!

1265
02:02:35,705 --> 02:02:38,731
I only helped Blackbeard do
what any father should have done.

1266
02:02:38,875 --> 02:02:42,072
You are cruel and ignorant.

1267
02:02:45,782 --> 02:02:49,582
One pistol, one shot.

1268
02:02:49,719 --> 02:02:51,949
To kill myself before I starve?

1269
02:02:52,088 --> 02:02:53,646
There's no trusting you, love.

1270
02:02:53,790 --> 02:02:56,258
Besides, this is a
well-traveled trade route.

1271
02:02:56,392 --> 02:02:57,984
You can signal a passing ship.

1272
02:02:58,127 --> 02:03:01,585
Or you can just bite the
proverbial bullet, as it were.

1273
02:03:01,731 --> 02:03:03,323
And how will I get free of these bonds?

1274
02:03:03,466 --> 02:03:06,230
You broke free of your
bonds half an hour ago,

1275
02:03:06,336 --> 02:03:09,169
waiting for the precise
moment to pounce.

1276
02:03:11,874 --> 02:03:13,569
Admit it, Jack.

1277
02:03:13,676 --> 02:03:17,612
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,

1278
02:03:17,747 --> 02:03:20,045
I'd choose the dog.

1279
02:03:20,216 --> 02:03:23,583
Treasure! There is a chest with jewels!

1280
02:03:23,686 --> 02:03:25,950
Jewels with the power to
rule the wind and tide!

1281
02:03:26,089 --> 02:03:29,183
- You're making that up!
- Wait...

1282
02:03:29,993 --> 02:03:33,690
I am with child. Yours.

1283
02:03:34,931 --> 02:03:36,330
I don't recall that we ever had...

1284
02:03:36,466 --> 02:03:39,196
- You were drunk!
- I've actually never been that drunk.

1285
02:03:39,335 --> 02:03:40,461
Wait!

1286
02:03:42,338 --> 02:03:44,397
There is something I want to say to you.

1287
02:03:44,574 --> 02:03:48,738
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

1288
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:50,805
Go on, then.

1289
02:03:53,149 --> 02:03:54,480
I love you.

1290
02:03:58,054 --> 02:03:59,885
As do I.

1291
02:04:00,023 --> 02:04:03,481
Always have. Always will.

1292
02:04:07,997 --> 02:04:09,487
I gotta go.

1293
02:04:09,632 --> 02:04:10,656
Jack!

1294
02:04:12,969 --> 02:04:14,561
This is not over!

1295
02:04:15,638 --> 02:04:16,696
Jack!

1296
02:04:26,282 --> 02:04:27,772
Missed!

1297
02:04:43,066 --> 02:04:46,092
The Revenge is mine.

1298
02:04:52,775 --> 02:04:54,242
Sir...

1299
02:04:56,713 --> 02:04:58,578
We found this below decks.

1300
02:05:24,674 --> 02:05:26,938
All hands! Ply to windward!

1301
02:05:27,076 --> 02:05:30,637
Get cracking, ye blooming cockroaches!

1302
02:05:33,349 --> 02:05:35,943
The Crown served me well.

1303
02:05:36,085 --> 02:05:39,077
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1304
02:05:39,222 --> 02:05:43,318
...make way for Tortuga!

1305
02:05:54,437 --> 02:05:57,600
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted
shellback, you made it!

1306
02:05:57,740 --> 02:05:59,298
Aye!

1307
02:05:59,442 --> 02:06:01,034
And I trust we managed a profit

1308
02:06:01,177 --> 02:06:05,341
- from our joint enterprise?
- Feast your eyes.

1309
02:06:10,419 --> 02:06:12,944
The compass led me straight and true.

1310
02:06:13,089 --> 02:06:15,080
What of Blackbeard's
men guarding the ship?

1311
02:06:15,191 --> 02:06:19,093
I employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in New Guinea.

1312
02:06:19,195 --> 02:06:23,291
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

1313
02:06:23,432 --> 02:06:25,491
Shame indeed.

1314
02:06:37,446 --> 02:06:38,811
I hate that monkey.

1315
02:06:38,948 --> 02:06:42,384
So, the Pearl... Any
idea how to get her out?

1316
02:06:42,518 --> 02:06:45,544
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

1317
02:06:45,688 --> 02:06:48,714
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...

1318
02:06:49,225 --> 02:06:52,524
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this.

1319
02:06:55,164 --> 02:06:56,825
Jack, I have to ask...

1320
02:06:56,966 --> 02:06:59,833
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

1321
02:06:59,969 --> 02:07:02,494
You could have lived maybe forever.

1322
02:07:02,638 --> 02:07:04,606
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1323
02:07:04,774 --> 02:07:07,675
But better to not know which
moment may be your last.

1324
02:07:07,810 --> 02:07:09,835
Every morsel of your entire being

1325
02:07:09,979 --> 02:07:13,073
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1326
02:07:13,216 --> 02:07:15,741
And who's to say I
won't live forever, eh?

1327
02:07:15,885 --> 02:07:19,013
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

1328
02:07:19,155 --> 02:07:22,056
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

1329
02:07:22,191 --> 02:07:24,182
It's a pirate's life for me.

1330
02:07:25,127 --> 02:07:26,617
Savvy?
