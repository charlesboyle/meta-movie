1
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,878
NASA scientists are excited
over recent findings by the Mars Rover

2
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,424
of fossilised organic compounds
on the surface that indicate

3
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:26,303
at some time in the past there
may have been life on the red planet.

4
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,627
Thank you.

5
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:07,381
Was it really that hard?

6
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:10,301
Every day with the trash!
What is the big deal?

7
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:13,179
Well, can you imagine
what the world would look like

8
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,891
- if nobody took out the trash?
- Yeah, it would be awesome.

9
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:20,144
And speaking of trash,
have you cleaned your room yet?

10
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,480
And don't forget to shut the door.

11
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,111
Milo, sweetie, can you get that?

12
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:32,698
I have to do everything around here.

13
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,079
Stromboli's Slave Shack,
captive 331 speaking.

14
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,166
- Hey, stinker.
- Dad! Hey, are you almost home?

15
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,920
Because the movie starts at five, and
then it starts again at seven, and I...

16
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,797
Hold on. Slow down. Slow down.

17
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,799
I don't think I'm gonna
make it back in time.

18
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,093
Well, you can't miss the beginning.

19
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,011
That's when the vampires take
over the submarine...

20
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:57,807
No, I know. I know. But...
Iooks like my flight's cancelled.

21
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,434
And no one's flying till
this weather lets up.

22
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:02,728
I'm really sorry, Milo.

23
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,022
I'll make it home as soon as I can.

24
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:08,275
- I love you.
- OK. Bye.

25
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:11,445
- Hi, honey. What's up?
- Stuck at the airport.

26
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:14,698
That's too bad. Milo was
really looking forward to...

27
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,451
- I was looking forward to taking him.
- Yeah, I know.

28
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:18,869
I'm sorry.

29
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:22,331
Well, maybe if he
finishes all his dinner

30
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:25,918
he could watch Zombie Dawn III
on pay-per-view.

31
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:30,047
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

32
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:36,804
You didn't eat your broccoli.

33
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,807
Broccoli makes me barf.

34
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,392
Besides, it looks like brains.

35
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:44,979
Well, you like zombies.
Zombies eat brains.

36
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,315
Mom, no one likes zombies.
They're an abomination.

37
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:49,984
I'm committed to their annihilation.

38
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:54,321
OK. Well, no broccoli, no TV.

39
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:30,483
Milo!

40
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:34,487
Come over here.

41
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:42,203
- Is that broccoli?
- No. That's vomit,

42
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:45,956
- but I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.

43
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,166
Well, you're not gonna make me
eat it now, are you?

44
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,546
- Go to bed.
- But you said I could watch...

45
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:56,217
No. That was before you lied
to me and poisoned the cat!

46
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,927
- That broccoli was poisonous?
- No!

47
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:00,179
Of course the broccoli
wasn't poisonous.

48
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:02,181
- Well, you just said that...
- No!

49
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,600
I meant that it's
poisonous to the cat.

50
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:07,186
Well, how can it be good for me
if it's poisonous to the cat?

51
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:10,606
Because cats are not
supposed to eat vegetables.

52
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:12,400
Maybe I'm not
supposed to eat vegetables.

53
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:14,735
Milo! Just go to bed.

54
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:17,655
Now.

55
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:29,083
I thought I told you to go to bed!

56
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,211
You told me to go to bed.
You didn't say get into bed.

57
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:33,838
- It's not specific.
- Milo!

58
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:38,718
My life would be so much better
if I didn't have to be a nagging mom.

59
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,721
Yeah, well, my life would be so much
better if I didn't have a mom at all.

60
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:42,698
Cujo. Wake up.

61
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:46,827
I can't sleep.

62
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:51,624
I shouldn't have said
what I said, should I?

63
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,211
It wasn't a good thing to say.

64
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:59,423
I feel really bad about it.

65
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,720
I should go tell her I'm sorry.

66
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:09,683
Right? I'm gonna go
tell her I'm sorry. Right now.

67
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:20,069
Mom? Are you still up?

68
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,281
'Cause I wanted to tell you that...

69
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,666
Mom?

70
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:44,927
Mom?

71
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:47,513
Milo?

72
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,686
Mom?

73
00:09:57,857 --> 00:09:58,983
Mom!

74
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:21,756
Mom?

75
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:25,885
Mom!

76
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:31,682
Let her go! Let her go!

77
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:38,064
Let her go!
Let her go!

78
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:40,357
Mom!

79
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:49,909
Let me go!

80
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:08,010
Hey! I'm... I'm caught in here!
Let me...

81
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:13,349
Wow! I'm in a spaceship!

82
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:23,109
This is so cool!

83
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,247
Did I get super powers?

84
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:41,432
Hello? Is anyone there?

85
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,937
Hello?

86
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:49,732
What's going on?

87
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,519
Low gravity!

88
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,687
Keep it together!

89
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,988
Jump down chute number three.

90
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:40,991
What? Who's there?

91
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,662
Hey, keep it quiet,
and jump down chute number three!

92
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:47,748
You want me to jump in there?

93
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,333
Why?

94
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:55,256
Jump down chute number three!

95
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,801
Just jump down the chute!

96
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:09,478
Relax, it's like... a water slide...

97
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,567
without the water!
Or the slide.

98
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,388
A world of trash!

99
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,643
It is awesome.

100
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:04,950
Zombies!

101
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,295
Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!

102
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:17,755
I know karate!

103
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,882
Well, at least on the Wii.

104
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:25,846
No! I don't... I don't...
I don't want any trouble.

105
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,598
I'm just trying to find my mom.

106
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,394
- I want to find my mom.
- Mom?

107
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,604
Don't you understand? My mom.

108
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:37,775
- Mom? Mom!
- Yeah, my mom.

109
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:41,529
No, my mom. She's the one
that feeds me. She feeds me...

110
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,784
- Feem? Feem?
- Yeah, my mom. She feeds me.

111
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:50,996
No, no, she... she...
she washes my clothes.

112
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,457
She washes my clothes.
You know, my...

113
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:57,837
No, my... No, she... she...

114
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,798
My mom. She vacuums the house.

115
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,633
You know, she vacuums the house.

116
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:05,886
Yeah, she's the one...

117
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:10,349
No.

118
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:15,312
No. No, that's not it.
Stop. No! My... my mom.

119
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:17,314
She's the one that...
She tucks me in at night.

120
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,695
She tucks me in? My mom?

121
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:27,199
Can you... can you?

122
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:29,785
No. No!

123
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:32,121
No, you can't...
What are you doing?!

124
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:33,789
Let go of me.

125
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:55,644
OK. All right. Chill out, Chachi.

126
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:57,813
You seriously don't want to get
dropped right now.

127
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,440
You!

128
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,817
You sent me down a
trash chute, you jerk!

129
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:05,654
Yeah. Sit back,
relax and enjoy the ride.

130
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:30,262
Prepare to disembark the aircraft.
Let him down easy, TwoCat.

131
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:07,591
- Hello?
- You like video games, man?

132
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,719
Check it out. Space flight simulator.

133
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:14,265
I programmed it from the manual
so it's just like the real thing.

134
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:25,192
I'm just messing with you.
Hey, brother!

135
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:28,279
Yeah. You're not a Martian.
You're a kid.

136
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:31,449
Man, it's been so long since
I've seen another kid.

137
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:32,992
Hey!

138
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,578
I'm excited, too, buddy.
My name is Gribble.

139
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:38,205
Gribble the First.
What's your handle?

140
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,374
No, wait, let me guess. Maverick.

141
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,209
- No.
- Wolfman?

142
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:43,294
- No.
- Iceman.

143
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:45,421
- No.
- Did you see Top Gun?

144
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:49,717
- It's Milo.
- Milo. How low can you go, Milo?

145
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,470
How 'bout I call you "My Bro"?
Check it.

146
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,889
You're a person...

147
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,891
from Earth!
- Shut up!

148
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:58,601
What, are you crazy?

149
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:01,896
I'm part of Ronald Reagan's
secret astronaut programme.

150
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,482
The Secronauts.
You might have heard of us.

151
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:07,026
We're here to stop the threat
of interplanetary Communism

152
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:08,611
throughout the galaxy.

153
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:11,489
Why else do you think
they call it "the Red Planet"?

154
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:17,578
I do crazy stuff like
that all the time, man.

155
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,538
You're gonna have so much fun here.

156
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:25,628
It's wobbly and shaky here.

157
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,255
Come on! I wanna show you something.

158
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:30,174
You gotta move pretty fast
to keep up with me, buddy.

159
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:31,884
- Wait.
- Come on down!

160
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:36,722
Hey, check my room out, bro!

161
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,352
Oh, man.

162
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,771
You're not used to the low gravity yet?

163
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:46,023
OK, OK, OK. Don't worry, man.
I can totally fix that.

164
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:50,236
I can fix anything.
There we go. I got an extra.

165
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:52,113
Listen, I just wanna try
and find my mom.

166
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:53,280
This'll hold you down.

167
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:56,158
- What is it?
- Right here. OK? I'm gonna patent it,

168
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,537
call it the Gribblemeister 3000.
It's working, right? That's awesome.

169
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:01,442
I wanna show you something cool.

170
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,249
- What?
- Hold on tight. Banzai!

171
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,087
The weight belt helping you?

172
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:11,715
Check this out, man.

173
00:22:11,757 --> 00:22:14,885
They're trying to figure out
how you escaped. Watch this.

174
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:21,684
Oh, my word! I cannot get out! Help me!

175
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:25,479
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Watch this, watch this, watch this.

176
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:32,153
You wanna hear what they're saying?
Sure you do.

177
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:34,739
Wait. Gribble, I wanna find my mom.

178
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,492
TwoCat! That is disgusting.
Here we go.

179
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:39,535
What is that?

180
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:41,412
- That's a translator.
- Wait.

181
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:44,957
- Supervisor not likee.
- Getting off me, you Martian!

182
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:47,084
Unauthorised dogpile!

183
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:50,838
- "Unauthorised dogpile"?
- I know. They say that all the time.

184
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,590
Come with me, man. This is so cool.

185
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:55,259
Hey! Come on in.

186
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,472
What do you think, bro?

187
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,267
- About what?
- About the room, bud.

188
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,394
It's for you, man.
What do you think?

189
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:07,605
- For me?
- Oh, don't mind this guy.

190
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:14,070
I just tried to train him to be like my
wingman, you know, but he's useless.

191
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:15,738
It's more like a wing nut.

192
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:18,574
Oh, gosh.

193
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:22,578
I'm gonna get rid of him.

194
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,580
But forget it, man. That's all history.

195
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:26,999
- 'Cause I got you now!
- Me?

196
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,876
- Yeah.
- What are you talking about?

197
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:30,878
I'm talking about you and me, bro.

198
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,590
Best buds hanging out forever.

199
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:38,636
Playing video games all day,
watching TV all night.

200
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:41,389
There's no such thing
as too much TV, man.

201
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,598
Mom?

202
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:47,061
Oh, yeah.

203
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,450
Maybe there is such a thing
as too much TV.

204
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,649
- No. Wait.
- I wanna show you something in here.

205
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,526
What are they saying?

206
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:56,987
Subject will be terminating.

207
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:59,407
- Oh-four, oh-three...
- "Terminating." Terminating?

208
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:01,158
Terminating. I love that movie.

209
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,244
Hey, you know what? Let's go. I wanna
show you something cool, dude.

210
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,246
No, wait. Gribble, what's going on?

211
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:08,207
I don't wanna tell ya,
and you can't make me. OK?

212
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:10,167
- Just forget about it.
- No, Gribble, tell me.

213
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:13,421
- Please!
- System overload! System overload!

214
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:16,507
- Tell me!
- Help! Hey!

215
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:18,050
- Tell me!
- Oh, my...

216
00:24:18,884 --> 00:24:21,512
Get... Uncle! Get off!

217
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:27,017
Chafe-y.

218
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:29,603
All right.

219
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,689
All right, I'll tell you.

220
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,609
Fact is...

221
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,238
Mars needs moms.

222
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:45,745
What the heck does that mean?

223
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,374
These are hatchlings.

224
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,753
They are baby Martians,
and they pop out of the ground,

225
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:56,922
like potatoes,
every 25 years or so.

226
00:24:56,964 --> 00:25:01,802
And the Martians, they're terrible
at mothering, which is ironic, really,

227
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:05,181
since the ones running the place
upstairs, they're all female.

228
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:08,225
- Can you get to the point?
- I... All right.

229
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:12,271
What they are good at
is building robots, right?

230
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:15,649
So they build these Nanny-bots
to raise the girls.

231
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:19,695
And each Nanny-bot gets one kid
to raise, and then it's toast.

232
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:22,615
It can't be reused after that.

233
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:24,909
Who knew mothering was so hard?

234
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:27,578
"Hard?"

235
00:25:29,246 --> 00:25:31,665
- So why did they take my mom?
- OK.

236
00:25:31,707 --> 00:25:35,086
They have to program the
Nanny-bots each time, right?

237
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:38,672
So... they find someone

238
00:25:38,714 --> 00:25:42,259
who is really good
at controlling their own kid.

239
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:44,387
Hey, that's my house.

240
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:49,642
And that's me!
Are these my mom's memories?

241
00:25:50,393 --> 00:25:51,644
Yeah.

242
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,982
See, all these Martians care about
is order and discipline.

243
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:00,694
What was that one about?

244
00:26:00,736 --> 00:26:03,114
Just tell me what they're
gonna do to my mom.

245
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:06,075
All right.

246
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,957
Right up there.

247
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:19,296
You see, they have this
memory extraction machine.

248
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,633
It takes the discipline
out of the mom

249
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:25,136
and it puts it into the Nanny-bots.

250
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,390
It works on some kind of
solar-wind focusing system.

251
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:32,476
And when the sun rises...

252
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,240
they extract what they need to
program the Nanny-bots, and that's it.

253
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:43,821
OK? That's it.

254
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:49,243
Wait. So my mom is gonna
lose all her memories?

255
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:52,371
Yeah, something like that.

256
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:55,583
No, that... that can't happen.

257
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:58,169
- We've gotta save her!
- Well, that's impossible,

258
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,005
- so, like, get over it and move on.
- But we've gotta try.

259
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:03,466
- We've gotta try!
- This, my friend,

260
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:05,634
is a Martian wristwatch.

261
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:08,888
You see the bars here?
Counts down to sunrise.

262
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:13,309
So you must have
about 6.93 Earth hours left.

263
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,854
Less than seven hours? That's all?

264
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,939
Let's say that,
for the sake of argument,

265
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:20,941
that we do, we disguise you.

266
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:25,112
And we use all this awesome spy gear

267
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:28,032
to guide you up to the surface.

268
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:31,786
Those Martians, man, they...
They're gonna spot you.

269
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:36,540
They're gonna chase you
and shoot at you and... and... and...

270
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,460
Wait a minute.

271
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:42,421
I think it's a brilliant idea.

272
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:47,051
But you just said
they're gonna shoot at me.

273
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:50,971
What? Oh, hey. What you talking about,
"shoot"? "Shoot"? That's crazy talk.

274
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:54,350
- That's what you said.
- Who said that?

275
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:57,478
Someone say he's gonna shoot at him?
What are you talking about, brother?

276
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,398
No one's shooting at anybody.
Don't even sweat it.

277
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:02,566
You trust me.
This is gonna be great.

278
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:04,860
No, you know what?

279
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:08,072
As a matter of fact,
this is gonna be...

280
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:13,452
Gribbletastic. Yeah!

281
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,877
I don't know, Gribble.
Are you sure this is gonna work?

282
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,630
Yeah, dude. It's gonna be awesome.

283
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:27,967
That disguise totally rocks.
Trust me, you're gonna blend right in.

284
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:29,844
Even the SISS won't spot you.

285
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:32,513
The SISS? What's the SISS?

286
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:34,682
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention them.

287
00:28:34,724 --> 00:28:37,768
They're the Supervisor's
Secret Security.

288
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,187
They're the ones
in the black uniforms.

289
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:41,981
But I'll take care of them, man.
Don't worry about it.

290
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:44,150
Anything else you "forgot to mention"?

291
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:46,986
What? No. What're you... Me?

292
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:51,449
Dude, honest Injun, man.
We're in this together.

293
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,035
Once he gets up top,
he's gonna give himself away.

294
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:57,288
They're gonna chase him
halfway around Mars,

295
00:28:57,329 --> 00:28:58,914
and I'm gonna save his butt.

296
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:02,251
And he's gonna be so totally grateful.
It's gonna be so cool.

297
00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:05,296
Give me a break.

298
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,216
OK, OK. So, it's a... it's a fib,

299
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:11,218
but it's for his own good, man.

300
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:14,555
After this, he'll stay down here,
where it's safe.

301
00:29:29,904 --> 00:29:31,238
OK, go ahead.

302
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:15,032
Dude, you march like a girl!
Which is kind of perfect.

303
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:19,161
There's that bleached-prune lady again.
Who is that?

304
00:30:19,203 --> 00:30:22,289
That's the Supervisor.
She's like the school lunch lady,

305
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:25,084
only with the power
to execute you on sight.

306
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:27,169
Man, Mars needs Botox.

307
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:31,507
Don't mess with her.
She runs everything around here.

308
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,596
Gribble, are you seeing this?

309
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:40,099
Yeah, man. Those tags are so cool.

310
00:30:40,141 --> 00:30:43,644
I don't know who does 'em,
but the Supervisor hates 'em.

311
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:45,646
Oh, hey, look sharp, man.

312
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:49,233
You see that tall building up ahead?
That's the Citadel.

313
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:51,277
Your mom's up at the top.

314
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,112
You get up there and get your mom.

315
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,030
I am gonna program the ship

316
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,950
and make it repeat its last
Earth mission, and then, boom!

317
00:30:57,992 --> 00:31:01,454
You're through the wormhole and home
in time for Pop-Tarts. OK? Easy.

318
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:06,083
TwoCat, this is it, man.
They're gonna spot him here for sure.

319
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:11,422
Stop it. Don't look at me like that.

320
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:12,923
I'm gonna take care of him.

321
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:15,801
Check it out, all right?

322
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:18,679
When he gets to the checkpoint gate,
he's gonna trigger the alarm,

323
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:21,140
the guards'll close in,
I'm gonna press this button.

324
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:23,934
The cleaning hatch is gonna open, gonna
drop down to the maintenance floor,

325
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:28,189
where he can escape down the
trash chute. See? It's very simple.

326
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:37,782
OK. It'll all be fine.

327
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:43,537
But if anything, you know,
weird or unexpected happens,

328
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:45,581
just run like crazy, OK?

329
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:54,423
You see?

330
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:57,760
Totally in my control.

331
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:04,475
I pushed the wrong one.
Oh, my gosh!

332
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:09,522
Oh, no, no, no, no!

333
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:19,407
Gribble, where are they taking me?

334
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:20,866
OK, just give me a minute.

335
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:22,576
Don't have an aneurysm.

336
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:28,332
Oh, man, OK, you're going up,
and that's not good.

337
00:32:28,874 --> 00:32:30,626
I thought I wanted to go up?

338
00:32:30,668 --> 00:32:32,378
Well, yes and no.

339
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,839
This is a very, very bad up.

340
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,801
OK, OK, OK... don't panic.

341
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:40,970
- Get ready.
- For what?

342
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:45,433
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!

343
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:49,979
And he's off! Yes! Finally.

344
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,607
Gribble! Which way now?

345
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:56,819
- Dang, I'm good!
- Gribble!

346
00:32:56,861 --> 00:33:00,364
I'm a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side

347
00:33:00,406 --> 00:33:03,159
Tart-choppin', body-poppin'...

348
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,036
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot
and tell me which way!

349
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:08,330
Did you just call me an idiot?

350
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:10,124
Which way? I'm lost here!

351
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,793
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

352
00:33:12,835 --> 00:33:15,421
I think that you have to apologise now.

353
00:33:15,463 --> 00:33:17,006
Gribble!

354
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:18,716
I'm waiting.

355
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:20,468
All right, all right, I'm sorry!

356
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:22,053
Apology accepted. Go left.

357
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:27,308
No, no, no, no, not that left!
Not that left, not that left!

358
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:28,476
Back up, man!

359
00:33:33,022 --> 00:33:36,150
- Turn it down, Gribble!
- TwoCat, turn off your alarm!

360
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:39,528
What is going on here? TwoCat?

361
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:42,740
Oh, no. Mommy? Mommy!

362
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:50,664
Gribble! I need to know...

363
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:52,541
Gribble, come in. Are you there?

364
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,962
Gribble! Come on, Gribble, this
is no time for the silent treatment!

365
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,974
Gribble? Help me.

366
00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:12,103
I'm trapped,
and there's nowhere to hide!

367
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:16,565
Gribble!

368
00:36:14,725 --> 00:36:17,770
If not using ropes, my friend,
you will needing wings.

369
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:22,817
We must cleaning paint off you
before someone is seeing you.

370
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:25,444
It will getting you in trouble.
Giving me your helmet...

371
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,365
The Earth hatchling!

372
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:33,577
Gribble! Gribble, come in. They've
spotted me! But I think I lost them!

373
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:39,500
Get off me! Let me go! Let me go!

374
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:42,503
Cool it! I gotta clean you up!

375
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:44,713
- Get off of me!
- Hey!

376
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:48,008
Mellow out, man!
I'm not the fuzz!

377
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,136
- I'm not bustin' you.
- You're not?

378
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:52,054
Check it out!

379
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,014
What is that?

380
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:57,393
- They were tracking me?
- Not you.

381
00:36:57,435 --> 00:36:59,770
They were trackin'
whoever you were chattin' with.

382
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:01,814
Who I was... who I was talk...

383
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:04,066
I was talking to Gribble! Oh, no!

384
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:10,573
No time! Sorry! No time!

385
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:27,214
You got time now?

386
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,052
This is so low temperature!

387
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:34,346
OK. You're from Earth,
so you must know...

388
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:38,225
What do you "turn on"?
How do you "tune in"?

389
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,019
What do you "drop out" of?

390
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:43,898
What powers do flowers have?

391
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:47,735
That's English!
Where did you learn English?

392
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,072
Two quarters ago,

393
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:53,240
I was working in the
administration block.

394
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:58,746
The Supervisor was talking
with 113-Elder-331.

395
00:37:58,788 --> 00:38:02,166
They were viewing some
top-secret Earth documents.

396
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,920
When they left, I wanted to check out
what was making the weird light.

397
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:07,546
What's going on here?

398
00:38:09,507 --> 00:38:12,259
It's a chrysanthemum, baby.

399
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:13,594
A chrysanthemum?

400
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:16,263
That's not a chrysanthemum.

401
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:17,515
And it was...

402
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:21,685
amazing!
So I copied all I could.

403
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:32,196
The way that light vibrated and sang!

404
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:35,199
Nothing in my world
has ever made me feel like that!

405
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:38,035
It was like my eyes were open
for the first time.

406
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,706
It was crazy beautiful, man.

407
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:47,044
This is a chrysanthemum.

408
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:50,548
Flower power, it's gonna change
the world, man!

409
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,633
Yeah, that's just groovy, man.

410
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:55,052
They called it...

411
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:56,512
Colour.

412
00:38:57,513 --> 00:39:00,975
Your hippie alien life story
is totally interesting,

413
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:04,186
but I'm kinda busy
saving my mom!

414
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:07,189
You mean your Nanny-bot.

415
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:11,068
No! I mean my mom!
She's a human being!

416
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:14,655
Wait. No, but...
I saw inside her headspace.

417
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:16,615
You said, "My life
would be so much better

418
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,534
if I didn't have a mom at all."

419
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:23,080
I know what I said,
but I was wrong, and I do want her.

420
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:25,332
Heavy! Why?

421
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:27,835
Because she...

422
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:30,588
She looks after me
and she tells me what to do!

423
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:33,549
Oh, like the Supervisor!

424
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:38,304
No, not like the Supervisor!
My mom is kind.

425
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:42,183
She takes me to Disneyland,
and she reads to me,

426
00:39:42,224 --> 00:39:44,852
and she makes me hot chocolate,

427
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:49,398
and she puts bandages on my cuts,
and she hugs me and she...

428
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:56,781
She loves me.

429
00:39:56,822 --> 00:39:57,865
"Love"?

430
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,203
Chute number three.

431
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:14,632
Crazy.

432
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:31,148
Gribble? Can you hear me now?

433
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:33,734
Gribble?

434
00:40:36,987 --> 00:40:38,072
Oh, no.

435
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:45,204
Gribble?

436
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:55,172
Gribble?

437
00:40:58,426 --> 00:40:59,510
Gribble?

438
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:04,181
Gribble!

439
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:10,020
Oh, no. That's only
five and a half hours!

440
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,568
Stupid weights.

441
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:31,375
"Private. Keep out.
No Martians allowed."

442
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:54,899
"Gribble."

443
00:41:57,526 --> 00:41:59,278
"George Ribble."

444
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:06,744
He must've been a kid, too,
when he came here.

445
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,580
Why wouldn't he tell me?

446
00:42:11,624 --> 00:42:13,959
TwoCat? TwoCat!

447
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,588
Hold on, buddy.

448
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:25,554
Are you OK?

449
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:30,267
Oh, here. Where's Gribble, TwoCat?
I gotta find him!

450
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:33,729
He's the only person on this entire
planet who can help me save my mom.

451
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:43,697
That burnt area. That's where
they shoot people, isn't it?

452
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:46,617
That's a firing squad,
and they're gonna shoot Gribble?

453
00:42:47,118 --> 00:42:48,536
TwoCat, we gotta save him!

454
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:50,955
Ladies, ladies,
you don't wanna do this.

455
00:42:50,996 --> 00:42:52,915
Listen, I'm a walking A-bomb!

456
00:42:52,957 --> 00:42:55,251
You shoot me, and the
whole planet's gonna go up!

457
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:56,893
You don't want that
on your conscience...

458
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:59,338
OK, seriously.
OK, you could be precipitating

459
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,592
a major interplanetary war here,
people, aliens, Martians.

460
00:43:04,427 --> 00:43:07,722
OK, listen! I've been
living in your sewers for years.

461
00:43:07,763 --> 00:43:09,849
I'm disgusting,
they're contaminated,

462
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,476
and they need a vaccine
and I'm the only one that has it.

463
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:19,984
OK. Listen. You made your point.

464
00:43:20,025 --> 00:43:21,861
I invented some great stuff!

465
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:23,988
I can let you in on
the ground floor, OK?

466
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:26,240
How 'bout blue mascara?

467
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:29,326
I've got a Slinky!
A Rubik's Cube?

468
00:43:31,454 --> 00:43:34,039
You like Dungeons and Dragons,
I love Dungeons and Dragons.

469
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:38,335
How 'bout skateboards?
I got millions... OK. Hey!

470
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:41,922
I can get you a Cabbage Patch Kid. Not
one of those gnarly ones, a real one.

471
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:43,924
What about a pizza?

472
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:47,136
You like crop circles?
I have quite a crop.

473
00:43:47,178 --> 00:43:49,221
Oh, and I'll teach you how to moonwalk.

474
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:50,663
Can't really do it in these chains.

475
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:54,435
Legwarmers!

476
00:43:55,811 --> 00:43:57,605
Wait, wait.
We're really gonna do this?

477
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:03,819
Unauthorised dogpile!

478
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:17,833
Hey! Milo, what are you doing here?

479
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,476
I'm rescuing you.
What does it look like?

480
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,047
It's exactly according to my plan!

481
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:34,934
Ki!

482
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:13,139
Hot, hot, hot!

483
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,516
Wait! Stop it with the shooting!

484
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,735
My toe! What are you doing?
Oh, my gosh!

485
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:30,156
When you're going
to shoot a laser at someone,

486
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:33,617
you should bring them
a change of underwear!

487
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:00,186
Hairy Tribe Guys.

488
00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:05,149
Wingnut?

489
00:46:08,861 --> 00:46:13,866
- OK. OK. Thank you.
- Oh, come on. Let go!

490
00:46:15,284 --> 00:46:19,580
- Let go! What are you doing?
- They're hugging!

491
00:46:19,622 --> 00:46:23,918
It's all these males ever do! That's why
the females chuck 'em down here!

492
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:27,922
We don't have time!
The SISS are gonna find us!

493
00:46:30,716 --> 00:46:32,176
- Run!
- Run!

494
00:46:46,107 --> 00:46:48,317
Wingnut! It's Wingnut!

495
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,740
OK. Come on! Come on.

496
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:55,866
What?!

497
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:02,665
Wingnut! No!

498
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:21,308
Wait!

499
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:24,061
Gribble!

500
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:29,775
Relax, Grib. Fat floats.

501
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:32,194
Hey!

502
00:47:48,878 --> 00:47:52,465
Oh, nuts.
There goes my sexy tan.

503
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:54,175
Less than three and a half hours.

504
00:47:57,553 --> 00:47:58,721
Echo!

505
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:05,436
This place is amazing!

506
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:09,482
It's Gribbletastic.

507
00:48:09,523 --> 00:48:13,819
You have got to stop saying that.
You sound Gribblediculous.

508
00:48:13,861 --> 00:48:16,572
Hey, hey.
TwoCat's homing in on our headsets.

509
00:48:17,448 --> 00:48:19,658
I built him with a location device.

510
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,160
I think of everything.

511
00:48:22,453 --> 00:48:26,040
I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb.

512
00:48:26,082 --> 00:48:28,626
Stretch... stretch that bar
across this rock.

513
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,836
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good, good, good.

514
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:39,053
You know this place is perfect?
We can rebuild right over there.

515
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:40,179
- You see that?
- No.

516
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:42,306
- Keep still.
- Yeah, right, sorry.

517
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:44,725
Build a whole new lair.

518
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:47,186
Be years before we fill
this place up with our junk.

519
00:48:48,145 --> 00:48:51,273
What do you say, pal?
You and me? Best buds?

520
00:48:51,315 --> 00:48:53,275
You can be emperor this time.

521
00:48:53,317 --> 00:48:57,571
And I... I shall be El Presidente.

522
00:48:57,613 --> 00:48:59,073
Hey!

523
00:49:02,034 --> 00:49:05,996
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this!

524
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:08,833
- Gimme that!
- But...

525
00:49:08,874 --> 00:49:11,669
Maniac!
These things are dangerous!

526
00:49:12,628 --> 00:49:16,674
Tried to blow up some trash once with
one of these, almost took my foot off!

527
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:18,175
Yes!

528
00:49:20,136 --> 00:49:21,595
Oh, good, it's nearly empty.

529
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:25,975
Anyway, why don't we go rebuild
right over here. What do you think?

530
00:49:26,016 --> 00:49:28,144
That lava slope looks
like our best way up.

531
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:29,895
My mom's running out of time, Gribble.

532
00:49:29,937 --> 00:49:32,064
- Let's go!
- Hey, no, come on!

533
00:49:32,106 --> 00:49:33,691
It can't be done!

534
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,737
Did you see what happened up there?

535
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,156
Man, I nearly got toasted!

536
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:42,950
To death!

537
00:49:45,536 --> 00:49:49,498
Thanks for saving me, but... I'm
never going up there again, man.

538
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,043
You... You can't!
You can't just bail on me now!

539
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:54,962
Bye.

540
00:49:56,088 --> 00:49:57,131
George!

541
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:01,093
Your name's George!

542
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:10,895
- What did you just call me?
- George.

543
00:50:12,605 --> 00:50:13,647
George Ribble.

544
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:18,986
- You were a kid, like me!
- Where did you get this?

545
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:20,446
This is mine.

546
00:50:21,238 --> 00:50:23,574
They took your mom, too, didn't they?

547
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:27,161
It's OK, Grib, I know how you feel!

548
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:32,208
How I feel? How I feel...

549
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,254
You have no idea how I feel.

550
00:50:40,174 --> 00:50:41,967
You see this?

551
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,097
This is when they chose my mom.

552
00:50:47,223 --> 00:50:49,100
But way before they chose yours.

553
00:50:52,436 --> 00:50:55,564
I know, Gribble.
It happened to me the same way.

554
00:50:55,606 --> 00:50:59,110
No. No, you don't know.

555
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:01,654
How could you possibly know?

556
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:06,033
I was a good kid.

557
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:09,703
I did my chores.

558
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:11,872
Put my things away.

559
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:13,916
I did as I was told.

560
00:51:15,793 --> 00:51:18,254
Turns out,
that's exactly why they chose her.

561
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:21,048
'Cause of me.

562
00:51:23,759 --> 00:51:28,305
Man. What kind of message is that
to send to a little kid?

563
00:51:31,058 --> 00:51:33,352
I know. It's not fair!

564
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:38,065
I'll tell you what's not fair, man.

565
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:44,905
Not fair is when a bunch
of scary aliens take your mama,

566
00:51:44,947 --> 00:51:48,075
your only parent, away from you
in the middle of the night.

567
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:53,080
Not fair is when you follow them,
and you sneak onto their ship,

568
00:51:53,122 --> 00:51:56,459
and you search
but you can't find her.

569
00:51:57,543 --> 00:51:59,587
And then you see her...

570
00:51:59,628 --> 00:52:02,089
They got your mama strapped
into some kind of machine.

571
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:06,177
Mom!

572
00:52:07,803 --> 00:52:10,598
So I grabbed a couple
of breathing helmets,

573
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,141
and I went to get her.

574
00:52:15,144 --> 00:52:17,688
But I didn't know what I know now.
I didn't know...

575
00:52:18,689 --> 00:52:22,151
that when the sun came up,
it'd start the machine.

576
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:27,198
I didn't know... what that
machine was gonna do to her.

577
00:52:32,912 --> 00:52:34,705
Not until it was too late.

578
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,793
And then I realised...

579
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,297
I was all alone.

580
00:52:44,924 --> 00:52:47,176
I'd never see my mom again.

581
00:52:51,597 --> 00:52:53,766
And I'd never be able
to tell her I loved her.

582
00:52:57,395 --> 00:53:01,273
"Never be able to tell her you
love her..." What do you mean?

583
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:12,326
No, no, you don't have
to worry about that.

584
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,247
It's not gonna happen.

585
00:53:17,206 --> 00:53:18,666
Not this time.

586
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:20,418
Not to you.

587
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,049
We're gonna go up there
and we're gonna...

588
00:53:27,716 --> 00:53:29,135
We're gonna go get your mom.

589
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,929
Really? You mean it?

590
00:53:34,056 --> 00:53:36,934
Yeah. You and me, buddy.

591
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,353
Best buds, right?

592
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:47,987
- Thank you, Gribble.
- Yeah, man.

593
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:51,490
Yeah, we'll get your mom back, man.

594
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:54,118
"Best buds."

595
00:53:55,995 --> 00:53:57,955
That's like the "love" thing, right?

596
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:01,625
My, my, my, my...

597
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:03,669
my, my Sharona!

598
00:54:04,295 --> 00:54:07,423
- No! Gribble!
- Evasive action!

599
00:54:08,132 --> 00:54:09,341
I'm sorry.

600
00:54:09,383 --> 00:54:13,137
- No, Gribble! Gribble, stop! Relax!
- Don't shoot me, please!

601
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:17,349
Gribble, Gribble! Relax! Listen!
She's not gonna shoot you!

602
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,185
- She's not gonna shoot you!
- She's not?

603
00:54:19,226 --> 00:54:20,686
No! She's the one
that helped us escape!

604
00:54:20,728 --> 00:54:21,729
She is?

605
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:23,939
- TwoCat brought her.
- He did?

606
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:27,318
I used to be administration
unit 231 -Ki-312.

607
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:32,323
But now,
I'm down with your scene, man.

608
00:54:33,783 --> 00:54:35,868
What is she talking about?

609
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,079
I don't know.
She talks like that a lot.

610
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,681
But I think she wants
to help us, right?

611
00:54:39,705 --> 00:54:43,626
Right on! Come on!
We gotta beat feet!

612
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:45,086
"Beat feet"?

613
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:48,089
Oh, you mean run! Yeah, we do!

614
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,091
- Yeah!
- All right, Gribble, let's go!

615
00:54:50,132 --> 00:54:52,676
- OK! Come on!
- It's just so weird!

616
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:55,971
Come on, guys!
This is the way out!

617
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:58,140
Is there gonna be a lot of running?

618
00:55:02,978 --> 00:55:06,607
Psychedelic! What are they?

619
00:55:06,649 --> 00:55:09,944
They're paintings.
You know, like your flower graffiti.

620
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:14,031
Wait! Wait, wait! Ki, Ki!

621
00:55:14,573 --> 00:55:16,450
Hold on. You're the one...

622
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:19,370
that paints those flower tags?

623
00:55:19,912 --> 00:55:21,705
That is so bad!

624
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:27,378
Bad? But... but it is meant to be good.

625
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,215
No. No, no, I mean... no.
Bad means good. I just,

626
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:34,510
I think that...
I think that they're amazing and...

627
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:41,225
I think that...
I think you're amazing.

628
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:45,229
Gribble!

629
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,566
- You can change colour!
- What?

630
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,362
That is also... "bad".

631
00:56:00,453 --> 00:56:01,829
What is that?

632
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:06,917
That? It looks like a family.
Kids and parents.

633
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,044
That's the "love" thing.

634
00:56:10,713 --> 00:56:13,424
What are "parents"?

635
00:56:13,466 --> 00:56:17,595
You know, people like my mom,
who look after kids like me?

636
00:56:17,636 --> 00:56:19,889
I guess you guys had families once.

637
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,807
You know, if you Martians had parents,

638
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:24,810
you wouldn't have to kidnap moms
to program your Nanny-bots.

639
00:56:25,436 --> 00:56:27,229
- Come on.
- But...

640
00:56:27,271 --> 00:56:30,983
But the Supervisor said that Martians
have always been raised by machines.

641
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:34,820
Wow, looks like she
lied to you, big time.

642
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,374
We never knew.

643
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:52,838
That's the Citadel.

644
00:56:53,464 --> 00:56:54,585
We've got to get to the top.

645
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:57,009
That's where mission control is,
on the surface.

646
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:59,345
Your mom is in
the Extraction Machine here.

647
00:56:59,387 --> 00:57:02,139
And your ride back to Earth
is in the silo here.

648
00:57:02,181 --> 00:57:03,682
That's all well and good, guys,

649
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:05,804
but I don't think we're
gonna make it to the Citadel.

650
00:57:06,977 --> 00:57:09,063
Why are they checking everyone?

651
00:57:09,105 --> 00:57:11,941
Well, you're kind of
a celebrity now, buddy.

652
00:57:13,651 --> 00:57:16,195
And who is that handsome devil
next to you?

653
00:57:17,738 --> 00:57:19,018
You better keep your heads down.

654
00:57:20,032 --> 00:57:22,785
If they bust you,
they will slap you in the joint!

655
00:57:22,827 --> 00:57:26,247
Wait a minute. That's exactly
where we wanna go!

656
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,416
Yeah! He's right on!

657
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,752
What? What... Hey!
We're going to jail?

658
00:57:31,794 --> 00:57:34,713
No, no. When they first found me,
they brought me straight to jail.

659
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:36,799
The jail's next to the silo
where they keep the spaceship!

660
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:39,093
- OK.
- Sub-level two. Go ahead.

661
00:57:39,135 --> 00:57:42,513
If we can get through the jail,
and up through the silo,

662
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:45,266
we can get to the surface.
And that's where Mom is.

663
00:57:46,308 --> 00:57:49,687
Yes, but isn't the jail
thousands of feet above us?

664
00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:51,856
One thousand and thirty-two!

665
00:57:57,862 --> 00:58:00,322
Wait! Wait a minute.
How strong is this line?

666
00:58:00,364 --> 00:58:03,868
I'm a little over my
goal weight right now. Hey!

667
00:58:13,002 --> 00:58:16,464
OK. We've got to take out the guards,
shut down the surveillance cameras,

668
00:58:16,505 --> 00:58:19,467
then we can sneak through the jail
and get to the silo.

669
00:58:21,677 --> 00:58:23,971
We catching the two terrorists.

670
00:58:24,013 --> 00:58:26,599
Supervisor ordering we must
locking them in cells.

671
00:58:27,391 --> 00:58:28,642
Is this gonna work?

672
00:58:35,274 --> 00:58:37,651
- No, wait.
- No! No, please, please, no!

673
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:39,779
I don't wanna go back to jail! Please!

674
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,655
No, no, please! No!

675
00:58:41,697 --> 00:58:44,325
I need a doctor and I've got measles!

676
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:47,661
And I've got gingivitis!
And I've got male pattern baldness.

677
00:58:47,703 --> 00:58:50,164
I will getting prisoner tranquilizers.
Where are they?

678
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:52,458
- Bottom left control.
- Restless leg syndrome!

679
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,834
I got Saturday Night Fever!

680
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:56,045
- Bat wing disorder!
- And halitosis!

681
00:58:56,087 --> 00:58:59,173
Yes! Horrible halitosis! I do?

682
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:05,096
Hey! Awesome!

683
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:12,186
And this officially ends
today's prison broadcast!

684
00:59:16,065 --> 00:59:18,776
Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!

685
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:22,696
OK, here's the plan.
I'll go get my mom.

686
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:24,156
You guys fire up the spaceship,

687
00:59:24,198 --> 00:59:26,283
and we'll be outta here
before they can say...

688
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:29,370
- Hey, Grib, what are you doing?
- It's Wingnut, man!

689
00:59:29,412 --> 00:59:32,248
He's still alive! Hey, bud.
I can't just leave him in here.

690
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:35,418
OK, well, get him out,
but do it fast! We gotta go!

691
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:39,046
OK. Come on! This will do it.

692
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:44,135
Yeah! Come on out, you freakazoid!

693
00:59:47,471 --> 00:59:49,223
I know. I know. It's OK.

694
00:59:49,265 --> 00:59:51,434
What's with all the grabbing
and squeezing?

695
00:59:51,475 --> 00:59:53,602
It's called "hugging".
It's another love thing.

696
00:59:53,644 --> 00:59:57,064
OK, enough already.
Come on! We gotta go!

697
00:59:57,606 --> 01:00:00,401
Man! I must have
opened up all the cells.

698
01:00:01,485 --> 01:00:04,864
- Who let the dogs out?
- No duh.

699
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:07,825
What?

700
01:00:08,951 --> 01:00:09,994
What's going on?

701
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:14,165
It's the hatchlings.
They're sorting them.

702
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:18,252
Yeah. The girls are
all assigned their Nanny-bots.

703
01:00:18,294 --> 01:00:20,379
And the boys are sent down below

704
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:23,007
where they'll be raised
by the Hairy Tribe Guys.

705
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:29,680
These guys knew a bunch
of boy hatchlings were coming!

706
01:00:29,722 --> 01:00:33,017
That's why they were dancing down
in the trash. They were celebrating!

707
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:35,269
Yeah, but all the Hairy Tribe Guys
are up here now.

708
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:38,153
There's no one down there
to take care of them.

709
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:41,901
The boys are gonna be all alone.

710
01:00:43,152 --> 01:00:44,862
And to be alone is...

711
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:48,074
to be without the crazy love thing.

712
01:00:49,158 --> 01:00:51,535
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys. We gotta go!

713
01:00:51,577 --> 01:00:55,998
Wait. Wait!
Go down the garbage chutes!

714
01:00:56,707 --> 01:00:58,292
Listen, listen! Guys!

715
01:01:00,044 --> 01:01:02,630
If you jump down chute number three,

716
01:01:02,671 --> 01:01:04,757
you can save the hatchlings.

717
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,884
OK? Do you understand?

718
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:09,720
Chute...

719
01:01:11,555 --> 01:01:14,308
number... three!
- Come on, Grib.

720
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,019
- One, two, three!
- We gotta go! They'll figure it out!

721
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:19,355
No, they won't!
They're dumb as a box of rocks.

722
01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:24,777
- Ki. It's no use.
- We gotta go!

723
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:26,404
Go, Wingnut!

724
01:01:38,332 --> 01:01:41,752
On the other side of the rocket,
there's a ladder up to the surface.

725
01:01:41,794 --> 01:01:43,629
But how do we get past
all those Martians?

726
01:01:44,797 --> 01:01:45,840
I can totally fix that.

727
01:01:46,507 --> 01:01:49,969
Hey, everybody grab a helmet.
Put it on real tight.

728
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,105
Good game. Good game. Good game.

729
01:02:09,905 --> 01:02:11,532
Here. Don't forget that.

730
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:14,827
Keep in touch, kiddo.
Get up that ladder over there.

731
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:16,120
Good luck!

732
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:32,970
Wait a minute! Won't they see me
from Mission Control?

733
01:02:33,012 --> 01:02:35,056
No way, buddy.
They'll be looking into the rising sun.

734
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:38,100
Won't be able to see a thing. By the
time they figure out what's going on,

735
01:02:38,142 --> 01:02:40,823
we'll be on the couch eating Smurf
Berry Crunch and watching He-Man.

736
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,246
- Gribble.
- Gribble.

737
01:02:59,288 --> 01:03:02,666
Yes. And I am Ki. Remember?

738
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:04,752
No, I know.

739
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:07,463
I mean... No, I said that
because, well, you know,

740
01:03:07,505 --> 01:03:11,175
the ship's got this...
voice-activated launch system.

741
01:03:11,217 --> 01:03:13,427
And I had to record a word,

742
01:03:13,469 --> 01:03:18,849
and Ki just didn't seem like a word
that would start an engine... you know?

743
01:03:19,308 --> 01:03:20,851
Except...

744
01:03:22,144 --> 01:03:24,271
now that I think about it...

745
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:26,816
"Ki" is like a perfect word
to start an engine

746
01:03:26,857 --> 01:03:31,862
because it's, you know, used to...

747
01:03:32,905 --> 01:03:34,865
unlock things like...

748
01:03:38,244 --> 01:03:40,079
my heart.

749
01:03:43,165 --> 01:03:45,793
I dig it when you change colour.

750
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,509
Gribble! Ki! I'm halfway there!

751
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:57,096
Oh, no!

752
01:04:04,729 --> 01:04:06,439
What dummy left that there?

753
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,942
Milo?

754
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:32,590
Gribble, I think I fell into something!

755
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:35,801
Gribble, come in!

756
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:22,390
- It's OK, Ki. I've got him.
- Great job!

757
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,642
- Gribble!
- Hey.

758
01:05:24,683 --> 01:05:27,812
- That's the second-to-last lens!
- We're not gonna make it!

759
01:05:27,853 --> 01:05:30,314
You wanna bet? Yeah!

760
01:05:30,898 --> 01:05:33,192
This thing is going
on my Christmas list!

761
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:12,690
Guys! The SISS are gonna
crash Mission Control!

762
01:06:12,732 --> 01:06:15,818
They'll be through the airlock
and on the surface any minute!

763
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,529
Oh, no! What do we do?

764
01:06:18,571 --> 01:06:20,698
All right, take her in.

765
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,243
OK. You go save your mom.
I'll take care of the SISS.

766
01:06:24,285 --> 01:06:25,703
- But, Gribble, they're gonna...
- No, no, no.

767
01:06:25,745 --> 01:06:29,874
My mama always said,
"Son, you gotta do the right thing."

768
01:06:29,915 --> 01:06:33,669
And for the first time since
I came to Mars, I'm doing it.

769
01:06:34,253 --> 01:06:36,422
Man, I hope Ki saw that.

770
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:38,883
Go get 'em. Fire butt blasters!

771
01:06:52,063 --> 01:06:55,941
Mom! Mom!
Mom, wake up! Wake up!

772
01:06:55,983 --> 01:06:59,612
Milo, can you turn the cartoons down?
I'm trying to sleep.

773
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:02,948
No. Mom, come on. You gotta wake up!
We gotta get out of here!

774
01:07:10,706 --> 01:07:14,210
Milo, the alarm hasn't even gone off.

775
01:07:14,251 --> 01:07:17,755
Can you just let me sleep until sunrise?

776
01:07:17,797 --> 01:07:19,465
Believe me, that would be a bad idea.

777
01:07:35,356 --> 01:07:39,610
- Gribble!
- Gribble, Gribble, Gribble.

778
01:07:40,736 --> 01:07:43,447
Oh, no! I activated the launch system.

779
01:07:56,919 --> 01:07:59,004
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

780
01:08:02,633 --> 01:08:04,468
Come on! Come on!

781
01:08:06,137 --> 01:08:08,597
Come on, Mom. Come on!
We gotta go. Hurry!

782
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:11,267
Hurry! Mom, come on! Mom, Mom!

783
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:06,113
Milo? The launch system lit up.

784
01:09:06,155 --> 01:09:07,198
I can't cool it.

785
01:09:07,823 --> 01:09:10,451
You got two minutes.

786
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:14,288
Two minutes! Mom, come on.
We gotta hurry. Mom.

787
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:19,877
Wait a second.
Did you just pull me out of bed?

788
01:09:28,344 --> 01:09:30,971
No! Mom, Mom.

789
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,724
Mom! Mom, listen.

790
01:09:33,766 --> 01:09:36,060
Mom, look at me. Mom, look at me.

791
01:09:36,102 --> 01:09:38,771
Look at me. I'll explain
everything, but later. OK?

792
01:09:38,813 --> 01:09:40,940
- Right now we gotta get to the ship.
- The ship?

793
01:09:40,981 --> 01:09:42,358
- The ship.
- What ship?!

794
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,070
- That ship!
- Milo! Sixty seconds.

795
01:09:46,112 --> 01:09:48,823
- Get it on!
- Everything's gonna be fine.

796
01:09:48,864 --> 01:09:50,658
- OK.
- Here. Just put this on.

797
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:53,828
And then you gotta twist this lever
to seal the neck. See? Like this.

798
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:56,705
- What do you mean?
- We need air. We can't breathe outside.

799
01:09:56,747 --> 01:09:59,458
- There's no air?
- Mom, it's Mars.

800
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:02,670
OK. One, two, three!

801
01:10:02,711 --> 01:10:04,505
Help!

802
01:10:04,547 --> 01:10:07,007
Now, start running! Run!

803
01:10:15,224 --> 01:10:16,851
Are those Martians?

804
01:10:16,892 --> 01:10:20,521
Yeah. The hairy guys are good,
and the uniforms are bad.

805
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,898
Let's just hope we don't see...

806
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:25,985
the Supervisor!

807
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:16,345
No! Mom!
You gave me your helmet?

808
01:12:16,387 --> 01:12:20,349
No! No! Mom! No! No!

809
01:12:20,391 --> 01:12:23,144
No! Mom! Mom!

810
01:12:23,185 --> 01:12:25,646
No! No! No!

811
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:29,442
No, Mom! Mom, no! No.

812
01:12:29,483 --> 01:12:32,236
Mommy, you have
to come home with me.

813
01:12:32,278 --> 01:12:34,321
You have to come home with me!

814
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:36,365
You're... you're my mom...

815
01:12:36,407 --> 01:12:38,492
and I love you!

816
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:40,536
No!

817
01:12:40,578 --> 01:12:42,872
No, no, no, no, no.

818
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,772
No!

819
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:14,987
Gribble! My mom!

820
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:28,000
Bingo.

821
01:13:30,294 --> 01:13:33,923
Milo! I'm coming, buddy!

822
01:13:39,428 --> 01:13:42,598
I got it. I got it.

823
01:13:43,224 --> 01:13:44,683
Lift her head.

824
01:13:56,028 --> 01:13:59,990
Milo. You saved me.

825
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:03,119
No. It was Gribble.

826
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,747
No, bro. No, it was you, man.
It was you.

827
01:14:07,289 --> 01:14:09,708
You saved your mom, man.

828
01:14:11,585 --> 01:14:14,213
I'm sorry for what I said before.

829
01:14:14,964 --> 01:14:17,633
My life wouldn't be better without you.

830
01:14:17,675 --> 01:14:21,512
Oh, Milo. My love.

831
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:32,189
Milo! Gribble!
I've got the ship under control...

832
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:34,900
- Ki!
- I'm good.

833
01:14:34,942 --> 01:14:37,987
- I can buff out the scratches.
- Come on, Mom. We gotta go.

834
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:40,030
- We gotta go.
- Oh, OK.

835
01:14:46,954 --> 01:14:47,997
Stopping right there!

836
01:14:48,956 --> 01:14:53,836
This is not over.
You will surrendering.

837
01:14:53,878 --> 01:14:56,589
Hey! Surrender this!

838
01:14:59,925 --> 01:15:02,303
Ki! What are you doing?

839
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:04,638
I will not letting you do this.

840
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:07,808
Insolence!

841
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:11,437
You cannot stopping this.
This is the way it has always being.

842
01:15:12,021 --> 01:15:13,522
No. No. No!

843
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,485
This is not the way it is always being.

844
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:21,822
She lied to us! Look!

845
01:15:37,588 --> 01:15:41,842
We were not meant
to being raised by machines.

846
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:45,429
We were meant to be raised by families.

847
01:15:47,264 --> 01:15:48,766
By parents.

848
01:15:51,852 --> 01:15:56,315
We were meant to having that... that...

849
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,984
That crazy love thing?

850
01:16:07,243 --> 01:16:09,370
That crazy love thing.

851
01:16:11,622 --> 01:16:12,748
Never!

852
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,336
You fool. I saved you!

853
01:16:17,378 --> 01:16:19,505
Before any of you were even born

854
01:16:19,547 --> 01:16:23,551
I realised we do not have time
to raise hatchlings.

855
01:16:23,592 --> 01:16:28,472
And the males? They never helped.

856
01:16:28,514 --> 01:16:31,183
Always dancing and playing.

857
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:34,770
That is why we must throw them away.

858
01:16:34,812 --> 01:16:38,899
There must be order.
Arresting the evildoers!

859
01:16:59,378 --> 01:17:01,839
Evildoer, you.

860
01:17:03,883 --> 01:17:06,218
No! I did this for you!

861
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:11,515
I did this for all of you!
You will be sorry. Let me go!

862
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,653
So are you gonna stay?

863
01:18:05,694 --> 01:18:07,988
Wow.

864
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,740
Wow...

865
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:14,245
Actually, I think I'm gonna...

866
01:18:14,286 --> 01:18:16,205
You know, Mars is different now.

867
01:18:18,207 --> 01:18:20,960
I'm gonna hang out with Ki and...

868
01:18:21,794 --> 01:18:23,295
help paint and stuff.

869
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:27,550
He's really good at red.

870
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:29,427
Stop it.

871
01:18:33,139 --> 01:18:35,599
So will I ever see you again?

872
01:18:36,767 --> 01:18:38,853
What? Are you kidding me? Of course.

873
01:18:38,894 --> 01:18:41,063
We'll keep in touch.

874
01:18:41,105 --> 01:18:44,358
- How?
- What do you mean "how?"

875
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:48,863
I could fix it.
It's gonna be Gribbletastic.

876
01:18:51,866 --> 01:18:53,492
Best buds?

877
01:18:55,411 --> 01:18:57,621
You better believe it.

878
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:07,631
Thank you, Gribble.
Your mother would be proud of you.

879
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:15,014
It's my pleasure.

880
01:19:18,768 --> 01:19:21,312
Oh, man.

881
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:24,940
I'm not crying. It's allergies.

882
01:19:24,982 --> 01:19:26,901
Silly.

883
01:19:27,693 --> 01:19:30,696
- Bye! Goodbye!
- Bye.

884
01:19:31,489 --> 01:19:33,491
Bye!

885
01:20:28,504 --> 01:20:30,423
I love you, Milo.

886
01:20:31,382 --> 01:20:34,051
I know that... now.

887
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:41,475
- Dad!
- Hi, stinker.

888
01:20:46,772 --> 01:20:50,109
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

889
01:21:06,876 --> 01:21:09,211
Did something happen
to Milo this weekend?

890
01:21:28,147 --> 01:21:29,190
Colour.

891
01:21:53,255 --> 01:21:57,259
Flower power is gonna
change the world, man!

892
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:19,884
- Mark.
- No, that's vomit.

893
01:23:19,925 --> 01:23:23,888
- But I understand the confusion.
- I thought I told you to eat that.

894
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:26,972
Well, you're not gonna
make me eat it now, are you?

895
01:23:27,308 --> 01:23:28,350
Mom!

896
01:23:30,686 --> 01:23:32,813
My mom. She... she vacuums the house.

897
01:23:32,855 --> 01:23:34,732
You know, she vacuums the house. My...

898
01:23:36,275 --> 01:23:40,404
Yeah, she's the one.
Yeah, that... No.

899
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:48,245
I'm just messing with you.

900
01:23:48,954 --> 01:23:50,664
Oh, don't mind this guy. He's a...

901
01:23:50,706 --> 01:23:54,168
I just tried to train him
to be like my wingman,

902
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:56,504
you know, but he's useless.

903
01:23:56,754 --> 01:23:59,048
He's more like a wing nut. Yeah!

904
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:02,468
No, you know what?
As a matter of fact,

905
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:06,889
this is gonna be... Gribbletastic.

906
01:24:07,765 --> 01:24:09,016
Yeah!

907
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:14,146
How about running, for starters?
Go, go, go, go!

908
01:24:15,106 --> 01:24:18,109
And he's off! Yes! Finally.

909
01:24:18,484 --> 01:24:21,904
I'm a tie-dye, superfly
Catch me on the other side

910
01:24:21,946 --> 01:24:24,740
Tart-choppin', body-poppin'...

911
01:24:24,782 --> 01:24:27,785
Gribble! Stop being such an idiot
and tell me which way!

912
01:24:28,702 --> 01:24:30,121
Did you just call me an idiot?

913
01:24:30,162 --> 01:24:31,622
Mark.

914
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:52,309
- Get... Wait a minute!
- Gribble!

915
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:57,231
Let's hit every single pipe
on the way down!

916
01:24:57,273 --> 01:24:59,108
- Gribble!
- I'm trying!

917
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:12,204
Again with the shooting?
We just talked about this.

918
01:25:12,246 --> 01:25:14,707
I think that...
I think that they're amazing and...

919
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:18,169
I think that...

920
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:21,172
I think that you're amazing.

921
01:25:24,091 --> 01:25:25,342
Gribble!

922
01:25:25,843 --> 01:25:28,929
- You can change colour!
- What?

923
01:25:29,597 --> 01:25:33,726
That is also... "bad".

924
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:35,853
- Mark.
- Chute...

925
01:25:38,064 --> 01:25:40,149
number... three!

926
01:25:40,191 --> 01:25:42,568
- One, two, three!
- Come on, Grib. We gotta go!

927
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:44,153
- They'll figure it out!
- No, they won't.

928
01:25:44,195 --> 01:25:45,738
They're dumb as a box of rocks.

929
01:25:54,789 --> 01:25:57,083
What dummy left that there?

930
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:22,233
No! Mom. Mom!

931
01:26:23,484 --> 01:26:27,863
Mom. Mom! Mom, listen.
Mom, look at me.

932
01:26:27,905 --> 01:26:31,575
Mom, look at me. Look at me.
I'll explain everything, but later. OK?

933
01:26:31,617 --> 01:26:33,077
Right now we've
just gotta get to the ship.

934
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:34,328
- The ship?
- The ship.

935
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:36,163
- What ship?!
- That ship!
