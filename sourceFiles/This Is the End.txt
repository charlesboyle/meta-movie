1
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,898
Hey, Seth Rogen. What up, man?

2
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:10,113
Oh, hey, John! Over here!

3
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:13,074
<i>Welcome to
Los Angeles International Airport.</i>

4
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:14,951
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

5
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,953
<i>Do not leave your baggage unattended.</i>

6
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,581
<i>All unattended baggage
is subject to search...</i>

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,793
We're so happy!

8
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:25,086
Look at this!

9
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,797
- What's happening, man?
- Good to see you, buddy.

10
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,340
- How you doing?
- I'm good, man.

11
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,425
Yes, you are.

12
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,218
How long has it been, man?

13
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:33,428
Sometime in the last...

14
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,472
-inside of a year or something.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,098
I have the best weekend ever planned, man.

16
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,684
- Lay it on me.
- I don't want to ruin it.

17
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,478
- Seth Rogen!
- Shit, here we go. Hey.

18
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,937
- How's it going, man?
- Yeah, good.

19
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,774
So, you, like, always play,
like, the same guy in every movie.

20
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,567
When are you gonna do some,
like, real acting, man?

21
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,651
Okay, thank you.

22
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,737
Give me something.
Give me, like, the laugh, man.

23
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,113
Give me the Seth Rogen laugh.

24
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,616
Seth Rogen, everybody.

25
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:57,952
All right, I've landed. I'm here.
We've said our hellos.

26
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:01,039
Can we please go to fucking Carl's Jr.?

27
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:05,794
I would love to. I'm on a...

28
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:07,420
I can't really eat that stuff right now.

29
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:08,755
- I'm on a...
- What?

30
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:09,839
I'm on this cleanse.

31
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,633
You're on a what?

32
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:12,967
I'm on a cleanse.

33
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,013
- What?
-It's good for you.

34
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,723
I didn't know...
You're supposed to take six shits a day.

35
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,183
- That's not true.
-It is true!

36
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,810
- You're supposed to shit twice a day.
- No.

37
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,520
That's not true.
That's what they used to think.

38
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:25,897
Now they know you're supposed
to shit six times a day.

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,566
So you're not drinking.
You're not smoking weed. You're not...

40
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,402
- No, no, I'm drinking and smoking weed.
- But“

41
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:33,154
I'm on a cleanse. I'm not psychotic.

42
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:37,158
Look, man, if you stopped eating gluten,
you'd feel way fucking better all day.

43
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:39,160
Whenever you feel shitty,
that's 'cause of gluten.

44
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,411
- That's not true.
-It is.

45
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:42,497
- Who the fuck told you not to eat gluten?
-It's just true.

46
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,500
- You don't even know what gluten is.
- I know what fucking gluten is.

47
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,877
- No, you have no idea what gluten is.
- I do know what gluten is.

48
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,462
Gluten's a vague term.

49
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:52,632
It's something that's used
to categorize things that are bad, you know?

50
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,343
Calories, that's a gluten. Fat, that's a gluten.

51
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,471
Somebody just told you
you probably shouldn't eat gluten,

52
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,223
you're like, "I guess I shouldn't eat gluten."

53
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:02,475
Gluten means bad shit, man,
and I'm not eating it.

54
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,522
God!

55
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:10,275
Each bite is better than the previous bite.

56
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,943
- It is.
- Gluten!

57
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,196
- Hey, this looks beautiful.
- Yeah. Do you like it? I totally redid it.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,615
- It's fucking awesome.
-It's all new. Those are new.

59
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,242
- God damn, son!
-It's pretty nice, huh?

60
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,578
So this is how the other half lives.

61
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,371
- Come on.
- Amazing.

62
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,373
- Air hockey tables.
- Jesus Murphy!

63
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,042
- Right? Okay, get ready, Jay.
- What?

64
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:30,211
- I have a little surprise for you.
- Okay.

65
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,547
Here's the best weekend
you ever had in your life.

66
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,885
- Look at it, man.
- Oh, my... Are you serious?

67
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,052
It's all of your favorite things.

68
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:41,556
- Starburst and Airheads on a...
- Yeah.

69
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,599
And it says "Jay."

70
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,392
- In joints.
- In joints.

71
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,352
It says "Jay" in Jays-

72
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:50,690
Seth Rogen, you are just the best people.

73
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,151
Come on, I know you don't love it in LA,
so I figure I'll make it...

74
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,653
You know, I'll lube up your entry a little bit.

75
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,739
- It eases the transition.
- Yeah, right?

76
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,407
This is the much-needed foreplay.

77
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,743
- You know what else I got?
- Yo, this...

78
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,286
- A 3-D television.
- No, you didn't...

79
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,288
- I got a 3-D TV.
- Are you serious?

80
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,708
- Oh, my God.
- I did it, man.

81
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,043
What?

82
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,586
Let's get into it.

83
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,379
Oh, my God, bud.

84
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,923
It's Gandalf the Grey's pipe.

85
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,257
Damn, no shit.

86
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,468
Hello, little hobbit.

87
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,970
- Spark my ganja.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,683
I'm a well-known homosexual advocate.

89
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,458
My eyes feel like they're melting.

90
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,960
I need a break.

91
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,964
You know what, actually?
We should go to Franco's house soon.

92
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,800
He's having a housewarming party.
He just finished building his house.

93
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:01,803
I haven't even seen it yet,
but it's supposed to be bonkers.

94
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:06,432
I haven't been in LA in, like, a year,
and I came here to chill with you.

95
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,643
We can chill together,
and we'll chill with those other guys.

96
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,645
We'll all chill as one big unit.

97
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,231
- Will I even know anybody there?
- You know James Franco.

98
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,901
- James Franco doesn't even know my name.
- Jonah Hill will be there.

99
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,486
Can't stand him. He can't stand me.

100
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,280
He's, like, the nicest guy in the world!
He likes you so much.

101
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,157
He specifically talks about how he likes you.

102
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,535
Out of nowhere, he just said,
"You know what? Jay's an inspiration."

103
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,246
There's no way he said that.
Also, just can't stand him.

104
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,999
- Okay, fine. Craig Robinson.
- Never met him.

105
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,500
He's hilarious.

106
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,627
Sweats a lot, but he's a great guy.

107
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:36,254
So it's gonna be fun, man.

108
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,716
For you, I will go.

109
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,343
I promise, I'll stay with you all night, okay?

110
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:45,680
I won't ditch you.
No, 'cause I want to be with you all night.

111
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,932
And you know why else?

112
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:50,351
'Cause nobody puts Jay in the corner.

113
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,905
Awesome.

114
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,658
- Thank you.
- Thank you. There you go. Cool.

115
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:07,243
- Thanks a lot, eh?
- Thanks a lot.

116
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,369
Okay, man.

117
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,496
Holy shit.

118
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,168
This is crazy!

119
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,503
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man, right?

120
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,714
- Look at it.
- A bit much.

121
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,550
I don't think it is a bit much.
I think it's right on the money.

122
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,177
What is he, Pablo Escobar?

123
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,263
Come on, man, this is an awesome street.
Channing Tatum lives up there.

124
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,140
For the love of...
Will you stop talking about...

125
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,308
This is the sexiest street in America.

126
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,894
- You and Channing Tatum.
- I think he's attractive.

127
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,147
- I think it's a cool house.
- I know you do.

128
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,484
I can't wait to see inside it.
That's why I'm excited.

129
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,237
Yes! What's up, man? Seth!

130
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,239
- So happy you're here.
- I'm so happy to be here.

131
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,574
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

132
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,076
- It's Jay.
-It's Jay.

133
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,536
I'll never forget it again, man.
Good to see you.

134
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,330
- Nice to see you. Come on in.
- Yeah! Yeah, great.

135
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,624
Check it out. My new place!

136
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,459
Awesome, man!

137
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,668
Designed it myself.

138
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:00,505
Really cool. This place is beautiful, man.

139
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,590
This place is like a piece of me.

140
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,759
You two just stepped inside me.

141
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,929
You let us both cum inside you. Yeah.

142
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,723
Icing on the cake. Check it out.

143
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:12,517
Painted them myself.

144
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,937
Side by side. A team.

145
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,021
Holy shit.

146
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,232
So, is it weird?

147
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,275
- No.
- You sure?

148
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,027
I really like it.

149
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,237
What do you think, Jay?

150
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,447
I'm not a big art guy.

151
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,782
You don't like art?

152
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,742
Well, come on...

153
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,744
- You play video games?
- Yes.

154
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:34,956
- Well, guess what, buddy? You like art.
- Yep.

155
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,291
- You ever been to Subway?
- Yes.

156
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,751
You order a sandwich?

157
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:40,962
Somebody put that together for you, dude.
That's art.

158
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,130
Sandwich artist.

159
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,507
- So, let me lay this on you, Jay.
- Fuck.

160
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,635
Your mama's pussy was the canvas.
Your dad's dick was the paintbrush.

161
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,720
Boom. You're the art.

162
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,223
- Thanks, James Franco.
- You got it.

163
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,808
- Seth!
- Mindy, hello.

164
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,476
- Oh, my God, great to see you.
- You, too.

165
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,811
Long time. How's it going?

166
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,147
- You know Jay?
- I don't think I've ever actually met you.

167
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,898
<i>You were so good "m Million Dollar Baby.</i>

168
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,984
That's amazing.
Thank you so much for saying that.

169
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,027
Oh, my God,
if I don't fuck Michael Cera tonight,

170
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,071
- I'm gonna blow my brains out.
- What?

171
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,365
Fucking pale, 110 pounds,

172
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,910
hairless, probably has a huge cock,
coked out of his mind...

173
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,246
You can do a lot better. That's just trouble.

174
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,916
So, Ri-Ri, how about you,
you ever see a psychiatrist?

175
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,298
- That's not cool.
- Don't touch my butt, bitch.

176
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,425
- Michael, that's not cool.
- Would you shut the fuck up, Jason!

177
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,385
We're playing a game, man.

178
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,637
Say cheese, baby.

179
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,432
- What's up, buddy?
- How's it going, dude?

180
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,725
Good to see you, man.

181
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,351
- Is that Jay Baruchel?
- Hi, there. Hey.

182
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,519
Oh, my God, get in here, dude.

183
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,188
- How's it going, Jonah?
- What are you doing?

184
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,523
- Good. How you doing, buddy?
- Oh, my gosh.

185
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,650
- Welcome back.
- Thank you very much.

186
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,611
- When'd you get in?
- This morning,

187
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,529
and boy, are my arms tired.

188
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,324
Dude, that's great.

189
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,408
- Thank you.
- Sick.

190
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,993
What have you guys been doing?

191
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,912
We just hung out all day.

192
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:59,916
Ate a bunch of dirty burgers,
and smoked about a fucking pound of weed

193
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,417
and played a bunch of video games.

194
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,711
Weed is tight. Weed is tight. That's awesome.

195
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,004
That's awesome. Weed is awesome.

196
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,423
It was like
the golfing sequence in Navy <i>SEALs.</i>

197
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,550
- Sick reference, though, bro.
- Thanks, bud.

198
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,802
Dude, your references are out of control.
Everyone knows that.

199
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,471
- Hey, thanks, man.
- I'm jealous.

200
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,848
I would have been there in a heartbeat,

201
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:19,227
but I actuallyjust adopted
this incontinent spaniel.

202
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,394
She's a really beautiful soul.

203
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,104
- Her name's Ahjhai.
- Ahjhai?

204
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,231
- Yeah.
- How do you spell it?

205
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:26,067
- A-H-J-H-A-I.
- A-H...

206
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,109
You want to see a picture of her?

207
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:29,237
- She's so sweet.
- Hey!

208
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,571
Look at her.

209
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,323
She can't bark. She doesn't know how, so...

210
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,575
- She doesn't know how to bark, even?
- She doesn't know how to bark,

211
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,244
so I've tried to teach her

212
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,496
and she just kind of screams,
and so she was up,

213
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,832
had her face smushed against the cage,
and was, like...

214
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,835
Yeah, cool.

215
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,797
Tell you what, boys, I'm kind ofjonesing,

216
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,259
so I'm gonna find someone
I can bum a smoke off of outside, all right?

217
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:54,178
- That's tight, dude. Honestly, I like you.
- Hey, likewise.

218
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,680
Okay, dude, come back.

219
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,599
I'll be right back. You're holding court.
All right, boys.

220
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,894
Dude. I know.
I think we're making some progress.

221
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:04,313
- That was really good.
- And honestly, he's your old friend.

222
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:06,857
- We're your new friends. He feels threatened.
- Yeah, man.

223
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,609
You know, and I get it.

224
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:09,652
It's gonna be fine.

225
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,321
I honestly think tonight's the night
we bust this whole thing open.

226
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,574
And I'm lucky.
It's the same thing a lot, though.

227
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,285
It's, like, my TV wife opens the fridge,

228
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:20,204
andis,Hke,
"What happened to the birthday cake?"

229
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,957
And I come outwith, like, a little frosting,
like,

230
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,375
"What birthday cake?"

231
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,043
-'Cause you ate the cake!
- Yeah.

232
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,336
'Cause you ate the cake!

233
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,629
"It's my birthday."

234
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,050
That's why y'all number one. 'Cause of that.

235
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,427
- You're Jay, right?
- Yeah.

236
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,511
- Seth's boy?
- Yeah.

237
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,014
- How you doing, man? Good to see you.
- Good. Likewise, likewise.

238
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,099
- I'm Craig, man. This is Emma.
- Hi. Hi, there.

239
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,809
You just in town visiting him, or what?

240
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,021
Yeah. Just for a little visit, you know.

241
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,106
I try to not come down here very much.

242
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,482
I don't really love it here.

243
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:53,404
- You don't like LA?
- I'm just not really into the LA lifestyle.

244
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,197
What lifestyle are you into?

245
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,783
Look at him. He's, like, a hipster, right?

246
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,453
No, I'm not a hipster, at all.

247
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:03,122
Yeah, yeah, you do seem
to hate a lot of things,

248
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,874
and the bottom of your pants are awful tight.

249
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:08,794
No, I just... I don't like Los Angeles.
It doesn't make me a hipster.

250
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,130
I'll bet you hate movies
that are universally loved.

251
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,341
- I <i>don't even...</i>
- You like <i>Forrest Gump?</i>

252
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:16,010
No, no, it's a horrendous piece of shit.

253
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,179
"Life is like a box of chocolates," no?

254
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,764
Yeah, no, I'm familiar with it.

255
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,059
"You never know what you're gonna get."

256
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,979
<i>Why don't we do</i> a <i>sequel</i>
to <i>Pineapple Express?</i>

257
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:29,523
- I would love to do a sequel to Pineapple.
- Do you have any ideas, or...

258
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,192
- I do have an idea.
- What?

259
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:34,487
It's that Red, Danny,
has become, like, the drug lord,

260
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,530
you know, since we killed the other one,

261
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:38,699
and he wants
to assassinate Woody Harrelson,

262
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:41,744
'cause he's gonna give a speech
that makes all of weed legal,

263
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,246
effectively rendering
drug lords out of business.

264
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,123
- Awesome.
- Yeah, it's fucking awesome,

265
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,793
but we don't have...
We don't know how it should end yet.

266
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,211
I know.

267
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,880
- Danny's trying to kill us.
- Yeah.

268
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,549
And I sacrifice myself for you.

269
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,094
And he kills me,

270
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,470
and I die for you.

271
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,473
And Danny fucking eats me.

272
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,142
- Why does he eat you?
- I don't know.

273
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,770
I'm just trying to think of, like,
the nastiest way to go.

274
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,231
Yeah, he could eat you. Okay.
That's a good idea, man.

275
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,608
He's just out of his mind.
He just, like, eats me.

276
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,276
- Hey, Chris.
- How's it going?

277
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,320
Hey, does this coke smell funny?

278
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,322
- Fuck!
- Michael, what the fuck, man?

279
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,949
That's expensive shit, motherfucker!

280
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,117
What are you doing?

281
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,577
I've never fucking done cocaine, dude.
Why does it fucking...

282
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,579
Well, you did the best shit possible
for your first time,

283
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,915
-'cause that's good fucking...
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, I'm nervous, dude.

284
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,375
- I don't know what...
- What is wrong with you, man?

285
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,501
- Look, he's freaking out.
- Oh, shit.

286
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,044
I've never done
this fucking drug before, man.

287
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:33,129
Mike, please.

288
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,839
I'll walk you through it.
I will walk you through it.

289
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,674
- Mike, no one...
- I'll be your guide.

290
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,342
- You're fine, Chris. You're fine.
- Is it on...

291
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,636
- You got some in your mustache, baby.
- What are you... Michael!

292
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:45,099
Now, fellas, I want you to real sexy right now.
We're gonna sing to all the ladies.

293
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,602
All the fellas go like this,
in your Barry White voice.

294
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,354
<i>Take your panties off</i>

295
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:52,022
<i>Take your panties off</i>

296
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,691
<i>Take your panties off</i>

297
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,609
<i>Take your panties off</i>

298
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,946
<i>Come on, Rihanna
Take your panties off for me</i>

299
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,032
<i>Come on, Craig, can you fuck off for me?</i>

300
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,662
I'll do one of them things.

301
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,539
Like an angel.

302
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,291
What about the host of the party?

303
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,042
<i>I ain't got no panties on</i>

304
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,795
<i>He ain't got no panties, everybody!</i>

305
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,630
<i>We ain't got no panties on</i>

306
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,382
<i>We ain't got no panties on</i>

307
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,134
<i>We ain't got no panties on</i>

308
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,428
<i>We ain't got no panties on</i>

309
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,514
<i>Ain't nobody got no panties on</i>

310
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,057
<i>We ain't got no panties on</i>

311
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,977
<i>Ain't no party like a no-panty party
'Cause a no-panty party don't stop</i>

312
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,188
<i>Fuck those panties</i>

313
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,772
<i>Fuck those...</i>

314
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,774
<i>Fuck those panties</i>

315
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,359
<i>Fuck those panties</i>

316
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:38,944
<i>Fuck those panties</i>

317
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,321
What's not kid-friendly?

318
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,822
- There's a lot of sharp edges.
- Concrete, sharp edges.

319
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,407
He's gonna bust his head open
on one of those things.

320
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,784
A kid could fall off
this fucking railing right here.

321
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,661
That's why you have the railing,
so they don't fall.

322
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,663
- Hey. Sorry.
- I want to have kids one day.

323
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,374
- Hey, Jay.
- Oh, hey, hi, Jonah.

324
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,460
Is there any place around here
I can buy a pack of cigarettes?

325
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:55,586
Yeah.

326
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,296
There's a place like,
it's like, four blocks away, maybe.

327
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,340
You want to come with me?

328
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,383
Give me this much time.
That much joint time.

329
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,763
- Jesus!
- Hey, Jay.

330
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,265
Hey, you need to use the toilet, honey?
Go ahead.

331
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,768
Nope, I'm... I sorry.

332
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,354
Who wants a sip? Sip time.

333
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,617
You okay, man?

334
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,369
It's nothing. It's just, you know,

335
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,580
as soon as we got there,
you did what you said you wouldn't do.

336
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,958
- What did I do?
- You just fucking ditched my ass.

337
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,835
I didn't ditch you. Are you kidding me, man?

338
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,128
I did not ditch you.

339
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,549
I was talking to Jonah,
and then you left to go have a cigarette.

340
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,718
Well, you know, my cigarette was an excuse.

341
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,887
I really went outside
'cause Jonah was being a prick.

342
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,639
Jonah was not being a prick.

343
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,224
If anything, you were kind of being a prick.

344
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,892
Jonah's the nicest guy ever, man.

345
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,687
Oh, my God, that's a thin veneer of kindness.

346
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,771
Nobody's that nice.

347
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,939
Jonah is that nice.

348
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,566
Serial killers are that nice.

349
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,568
Just answer me one question.

350
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,903
Is Michael Cera's butthole
as adorable as I pictured?

351
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,238
Oh, for fuck's sake.

352
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,033
I picture it looking like a little donut,
like a little pink sprinkled donut.

353
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,077
It's so bright in here.

354
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,745
It is fucking bright.

355
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,581
I'm so high.

356
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:17,126
There's so many delicious choices.
What do I do?

357
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,086
- I'm gonna get something to drink.
- Okay.

358
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,423
Excuse me, would it be possible
for my daughter to use your restroom?

359
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,966
She's really got to go.

360
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,427
Read the sign. Customers only.

361
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,511
Seriously?

362
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:30,222
Why the fuck you think I put up the sign?

363
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,099
It's okay, Dad. I can hold it.

364
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,685
Let's just buy something for your mother.

365
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,313
Yeah, well, I guess you better, huh?

366
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,941
This cash register lady is mean.
I have anxiety. Will you buy this for me?

367
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,484
When I'm stoned, I can't do this.

368
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,778
I think I'm just gonna head
back to your place.

369
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,740
I'm not really liking it very much
over there at Franco's.

370
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,242
Dude, I want you to get to know these guys.
That's never gonna happen

371
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:53,245
if you don't put in
any effort whatsoever, okay?

372
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,872
I hate it in there.

373
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,541
I just want to drink some pop
and smoke some weed.

374
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,727
What about...

375
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,148
What about me?

376
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,925
Are you okay? Are you okay?

377
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,385
Did you just see that?

378
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,803
What the hell?

379
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,973
- Oh, my God, Jesus, Jesus!
- Run, run, run!

380
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,144
- This way!
-Okav, okay, okay!

381
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,858
Oh, my God!

382
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,193
Jesus.

383
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,862
Run!

384
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,280
Jesus Christ!

385
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,617
Why the fuck did you bring me down here?

386
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,871
- The fuck, Seth?
- I don't know what's happening!

387
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,041
- We're going back to Franco's.
- Why?

388
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,044
Just run! Keep running!

389
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,421
Oh, my fuck!

390
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,216
We are going back to Franco's!

391
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,342
God damn it.

392
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,470
- Jesus!
- Shit!

393
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,516
This way. We're almost there! We're so close!

394
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:43,814
Hey, you guys okay?

395
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:44,982
Are you guys Okay?

396
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,901
There was a crazy earthquake.
Did you guys feel that?

397
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,403
- That was insane.
- Fuck,no.

398
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,239
We can't feel anything in here.
This place is a fucking fortress.

399
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,116
That wasn't an earthquake, man.

400
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,784
- That was something way fucking crazier.
- No...

401
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:56,869
What's crazier than an earthquake?

402
00:17:56,952 --> 00:18:00,414
There were beams of blue light
coming out of the sky

403
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,000
and people getting sucked up into the sky.

404
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,294
He's on hallucinogens.

405
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:09,089
Come on, guys. Don't bully Jay.
He's a sweetheart.

406
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,466
Keep going, man.
What are you talking about?

407
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:16,764
There were people, and they were there,
and they got sucked up into the sky.

408
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,640
- Jay.
- Sucked up into the sky?

409
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,267
Nobody got sucked up in here.

410
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,352
I got sucked off here.

411
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,984
No, okay, ask Seth. He was...
You were there. Tell them.

412
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,487
Seth, what the fuck's he talking about?

413
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,159
I have no idea
what he's talking about honestly.

414
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,995
Did anybody get sucked up into the sky?

415
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,623
I didn't see anything.
I don't know what he's talking about.

416
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,291
You were there with me.
What are you saying?

417
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,336
All those people that were in the store
with us, they just fucking vanished.

418
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,171
I didn't see blue light
sucking people up in the sky.

419
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,632
You sound crazy, man.
We should just be lucky we're...

420
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,009
-it's not over!
-It's okay. Just relax.

421
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:58,639
Everyone, it's all right. Just a little tremor.
Party's still going.

422
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,183
In-N-Out truck's coming in 10 minutes.

423
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,894
- Yes.
- Animal style!

424
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,646
Oh, my fuck!

425
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,523
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
- Move! Move!

426
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,817
- Move, move, move, move!
- This place is safe!

427
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,652
This place is not safe!

428
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,986
Craig, where you going, man?

429
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,905
- It's a fucking earthquake!
- Fuck!

430
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,824
- Move, move, move, come on!
- Get out of my way. Move, girl!

431
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,076
- Oh, my God, Seth!
- Oh, shit!

432
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,577
- Seth.
- What the fuck?

433
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,997
Don't go on the grass,
not everybody on the grass!

434
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,051
What the fuck?

435
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,553
Oh, God!

436
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,221
- What the fuck is happening?
- Paul!

437
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,722
What's happening?

438
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,517
All right, everybody, listen up. Listen up.

439
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,270
Who took my fucking cell phone, man?

440
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,939
- Martin, empty your pockets!
- What?

441
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,441
I saw you in the bathroom, man!
Somebody dial my phone!

442
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,360
Shut the fuck up! It's unbelievable!

443
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,738
It's unacceptable after all the coke
I've wasted on you people.

444
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,199
- I've thrown it away.
- I didn't take your fucking cell phone.

445
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:02,452
-310...
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike...

446
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,455
My face!

447
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,749
What's happening to me? What's happening?

448
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,251
Oh, my God!

449
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,932
Shit, that's embarrassing.

450
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,327
Rihanna!

451
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,127
Please give me your foot!

452
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,587
Oh, my God!

453
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,216
Craig, Craig, help me. I'm losing my grip!

454
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,635
It's too late for you!
You're already in the hole!

455
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,887
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Get the fuck out of my way!

456
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:06,934
Sorry.

457
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,603
Karen!

458
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,356
Seth, come on! Get in the house!
Come on, Seth!

459
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,695
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

460
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,157
Martin!

461
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,451
- Shit!
- Kevin! Kevin!

462
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,577
What the fuck?

463
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,329
Geez, get the fuck off me, Aziz!

464
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,085
Fuck you, Kevin!

465
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,296
Oh, God, no, get your fucking hands off me!

466
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,631
Get your fucking...

467
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,477
No!

468
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,480
Jay, I can't hold on much longer.

469
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,483
You have to reach out and grab me.
You hear?

470
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:00,278
Okay, you take my hand,
and I will swing you up.

471
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,030
Are you sure?
I'm gonna give you my whole weight.

472
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:03,490
- I'm gonna reach for you, all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

473
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,325
Are you sure you can do that?

474
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,660
I can grab you on three.

475
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,328
One, two, three.

476
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,582
All right, buddy.

477
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,794
- Now I'm gonna, I'm gonna swing across.
- I got you, buddy.

478
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,422
- You're gonna hold my weight, all of it.
- Okay, come on.

479
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,507
- You can hold on to my full weight?
- I can do it.

480
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,550
- I don't want to die.
- Okay.

481
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,301
- Едно,две...
- Две, три...

482
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,053
Не!

483
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:29,099
Не! Не!

484
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,165
О,човече!

485
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,126
Мамка му!

486
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,596
- Мамка му!
- Какво стана?

487
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,222
- Джей,ти си жив!
- Джей...

488
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,682
- О, слава богъ,Джей!
- Още не съм мъртъв.

489
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,267
Казах ви да не излизате навън.

490
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,853
- Whatjust happened?
- Jesus Christ, they are all fucking dead.

491
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,564
- I told you guys not to run outside.
- You all right?

492
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:21,443
- I tried to save Aziz. I tried.
- You did your best, man. I love you.

493
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,820
Why the fuck did you guys run out there?

494
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,447
You know what, James,
can you lower your voice?

495
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,740
You're freaking out Jay!

496
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,658
Maybe I'm a little freaked out, too!

497
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,410
- He's not as strong as you.
- They all fell in.

498
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,454
- Look at my house!
- I tried to save them. They all fell in.

499
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,248
Get your fucking hands off me.
Jonah, stop touching me.

500
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:38,126
Can we get Jay some water, please?
Can we get him some hydration?

501
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,669
- He needs to be hydrated.
- The water's not working!

502
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,254
Everyone just runs out the door!

503
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,589
My phone is dead.

504
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,341
Guys, the fucking lnternet's not working!

505
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,301
Let's watch the TV. Let's check the news.

506
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,178
Where is the TV?

507
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,263
-It's in the floor.
- In the floor?

508
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,099
- That's dope.
- Yeah, cool, huh?

509
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,183
That's really neat.

510
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,643
That is impressive, James.

511
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,895
<i>The biggest earthquake to ever hit Los...</i>

512
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,773
<i>Officers urging people to stay
in their homes right now.</i>

513
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,943
<i>And also reports of looting and rioting
are spreading across the city.</i>

514
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,194
Riots.

515
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:07,781
<i>Police are pretty much outnumbered
as people are turning to one another.</i>

516
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,616
<i>Martial law has now been declared.</i>

517
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,159
<i>Air Force One has gone down...</i>

518
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,205
Shit. It's gone, guys.

519
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:19,459
So I think we should...

520
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,629
I think we should probably
go back to your place, eh?

521
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,131
What are you talking about, man?

522
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:27,384
No, no way. I'm not leaving here.

523
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,846
I don't want to die at James Franco's house.

524
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,806
You heard the TV.

525
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,560
The TV said stay here.
It said stay in your homes.

526
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,729
We need to stay here
until they start rescuing people, okay?

527
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,315
A huge earthquake happens.
Who do they rescue first?

528
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,817
- Actors.
- Famous people.

529
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,361
They'll get Clooney, Sandra Bullock, me.

530
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,196
If there's room, you guys'll come.

531
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,407
The point is, is that
we're all gonna get out of this first.

532
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,994
- What the hell was that?
-It's already going crazy out there, guys.

533
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,330
We can't leave. I'm not leaving, okay?
I'm a victim.

534
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,250
I've had a victim's mentality my whole life.
People can smell it on me.

535
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,169
When I was a kid, I had man-titties.

536
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,920
The bullies held me down,
they tittie-fucked me.

537
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,338
That's what's happening out there right now.

538
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,673
That's right, we are all soft.

539
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:07,883
- Yeah.
- We are all soft!

540
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,926
We are actors! We pretend to be hard, man.

541
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,845
- Yeah.
- We soft as baby shit.

542
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,514
As baby shit, soft as...
Wait, Craig, what are you doing, man?

543
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:17,100
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing to the painting, man?

544
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,810
- We got to board this shit up, man.
- Board it up?

545
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,353
We got to protect ourselves. We don't know

546
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,105
-how long we gonna be in here.
- Okay, chill.

547
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,398
There's raccoons, and bandits,
and shit out there.

548
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,941
- This is <i>Obey,</i> man!
- If you get out the way!

549
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,360
This is my favorite fucking painting!
What are you doing, Craig?

550
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,445
Guys, help.

551
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,363
Help. Help. Get off.

552
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,033
Chill. Look.

553
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,910
Helicopter! Helicopter!

554
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:40,040
The good guys are here.
We're fine! It's gonna be fine.

555
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:45,795
God damn!

556
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,756
God damn!

557
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,591
Shit!

558
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,093
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

559
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,304
Fuck your house, Franco!

560
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,640
My house didn't do that!

561
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:05,106
You don't got a tool kit or nothing?
Just a toolbox?

562
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,566
I don't know. Look in there.

563
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,113
Where's the edge of this shit?

564
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,324
Your thumb's in my butthole, man.

565
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,577
Y'all need this dick?

566
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:18,662
No, we're not using it.

567
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,247
All right, I'm gonna take it over here.

568
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,666
- Careful with that dick.
- Damn.

569
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,379
It's heavy.

570
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,174
There it is, got that dick now.

571
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,677
That dick is coming now.

572
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,513
Yeah, got this big dick.

573
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,143
Hey, hey.

574
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:43,812
- What now?
- Listen.

575
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:46,940
Not the Rogen, all right? Don't take him.

576
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,066
Take me.

577
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:51,611
We got 12 bottles of water,
56 beers, two vodkas,

578
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,781
four whiskeys, six bottles of wine,
tequila, Nutella,

579
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:58,576
cheese, pizza, eggs, bananas,
apples, bacon, steaks,

580
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,580
pancake mix, CT Crunch, milk,
ketchup, a Milky Way,

581
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,709
half ounce Sour Diesel,
three and a half grams Grand Master Kush,

582
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,961
one ounce of 'shrooms, 15 pills of ecstasy,

583
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,046
a porno mag, a baseball bat,

584
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,465
and the video camera
from the movie 27 <i>Hours.</i>

585
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,050
<i>127 Hours.</i>

586
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,679
<i>127 Hours.</i>

587
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,974
And a functioning revolver
from the movie <i>Flyboys.</i>

588
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,434
Old Faithful.

589
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:23,852
- Jesus.
- Thing's real.

590
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:25,729
- No, I kept this from the movie.
- Yeah.

591
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,355
- This is an actual revolver.
- I see.

592
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,607
Franco, that's very uncomfortable.
Could you put that down, please?

593
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,650
Loaded.

594
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,152
- Loveit
- Awesome.

595
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,903
- Can you just put the gun away?
- I always keep my props.

596
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,031
- That's really cool.
- Always keep my props.

597
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,198
I know how to handle it.

598
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,285
He knows what he's doing. I like this bit.
I like it. I get it. Let me see.

599
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,329
- It's real. It's heavy.
- Let me see it like that.

600
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:43,997
- God damn!
- Come on, guys!

601
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,165
- You could kill...
- Careful.

602
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,333
- Bang,bang!
- Jesus!

603
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,709
- Please, put it down!
- Fuck!

604
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,878
Bang, bang, bang. You're dead.

605
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:52,005
- I hope you're fucking happy.
- Pow, pow, pow.

606
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,757
Stop... Guys, stop fucking with the gun.

607
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,342
- Jesus!Jesus!
- Pow, pow.

608
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:56,426
- It's a real gun!
- Bang.

609
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,510
It's so funny. It's so funny.

610
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,054
- Guys, it's funny.
-It's not funny!

611
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,513
We're getting sidetracked.

612
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:01,890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

613
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:03,350
- I'll just kill myself.
- No!

614
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,601
- Don't do that, Jonah!
-Jesus.

615
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:05,685
- Oh, no.
- Jonah, give it back.

616
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,354
- I don't know! I don't know.
- Don't do that.

617
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,189
- Jonah.
- I'm so...

618
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,024
- Oh, my God. Hey.
- Oh, dude.

619
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,026
- Come on, no, no. Don't. Jesus!
- Would you put the thing down?

620
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,194
The whole...

621
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,570
I'm trying to have some fun, man.

622
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,322
Okay, okay, Jesus.

623
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,491
Look, just because a bunch
of people fell into a hole outside

624
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:20,992
doesn't mean we can't have some fun.

625
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:23,703
We're a bunch of best friends hanging out.
It's like a sleepover.

626
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,164
Okay, food.
How are we gonna deal with this?

627
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,334
Can I have that Milky Way?

628
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,877
No, you can't have the Milky Way.

629
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,087
- That's my Milky Way.
- There's a bunch... What?

630
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,546
I went out this morning,

631
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,716
specifically bought this Milky Way
to eat after my party.

632
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,302
- That's weird.
-It's not weird. It's my special food.

633
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,054
I like it. Back me up on that, Seth.

634
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,389
I don't think you should get
the whole Milky Way.

635
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,515
I want some of the Milky Way.

636
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:46,309
I'd be pretty bummed if I don't
at least get a bite of the Milky Way.

637
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,435
Now Craig wants a bite of the Milky Way.

638
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,938
Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way.
It's a fucking Milky Way.

639
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:52,732
A fifth of everything
is what's fair and reasonable.

640
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,609
Everyone gets a fifth of everything.

641
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,236
I want one-fifth of your T-shirt!

642
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,071
I want the bottom part, the belly.

643
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,614
I'm not sporting a crop top in your house.

644
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,241
I'll cut that shit off and make a headband.

645
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,034
You couldn't handle my midriff.

646
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,954
Guys, the only issue is,
I kind of need the Milky Way.

647
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,205
For fuck's sake.

648
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,581
No, for real, I have low blood sugar,

649
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,666
and if my endorphins drop too low,

650
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,750
I'm gonna be a nightmare to be around.

651
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,752
- What?
- Your LBS starts acting up,

652
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,796
you can have a finger scoop of Nutella,
okay?

653
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,298
- One finger scoop of Nutella.
- Fair.

654
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,008
I'm going to bed.

655
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,510
Jesus fucking...

656
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,178
Don't touch that Milky Way, Jonah.

657
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:23,555
Night, James.

658
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,937
Oh, God, no!

659
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,064
Fuck.

660
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,304
-Hey.
-Hey.

661
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,181
I'm gonna sleep with you.

662
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:07,640
- What?
- I'm gonna sleep with you.

663
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,851
- It's too scary to sleep alone.
- But this is my little area.

664
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,561
Well, I'm invading your little area.

665
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,564
I'm sorry, but I'm too scared, okay?

666
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:15,648
Are you mad at me, man?

667
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,484
If I was pissed at you,

668
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,819
I'm sure it would have something to do

669
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:24,574
with the fact that I had no interest
in coming to this house socially,

670
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,494
and now, I am barricaded in here

671
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:30,538
with a bunch of people that I really hate.

672
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,665
Maybe this was meant to be.

673
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:36,002
Maybe this horrible, horrible,
deadly earthquake happened

674
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,379
so we could become closer
as a group of friends.

675
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:42,050
I don't need a group. I'm like DMX, man.
I'm a lone wolf.

676
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:45,762
DMX isn't a lone wolf.
DMX has the Ruff Ryder crew.

677
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:48,139
You can't stop, drop,
and open up shop alone.

678
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:52,352
You need people to help you
in an earthquake disastery situation.

679
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:56,356
It was something else. It was Judgment Day.

680
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,815
<i>Like Terminator 2?</i>

681
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,151
No, not like Terminator 2. For God's sakes.

682
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,028
Like Skynet? You think this is Skynet?

683
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,363
- Like, Skynet went live?
- No.

684
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,198
Will you please stop saying "Skynet"?

685
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,408
Well, you're the one that said Judgment Day.

686
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,077
The biblical Judgment Day.

687
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,205
- What?
- That's crazy. It's just...

688
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,582
- You fucking heathen.
- Okay, here's the thing.

689
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:18,545
Let's say for a second there was blue light
sucking people up into the sky.

690
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:22,131
That means that we were not
awesome enough to go to heaven.

691
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,551
Shit! Shit.

692
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,099
What y'all doing?

693
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:32,934
Fuck you, Craig.

694
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,852
I'm scared. It's scary by myself.

695
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:36,563
It's way better with more people.

696
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,525
- I'm gonna come down here.
- Yeah, good, yeah. Get in here, man.

697
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,568
Get right in there.

698
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,236
So, you're gonna...

699
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,737
- Right here.
- Right here.

700
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:47,448
I feel better, actually. I like that.

701
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,827
It's better with more people.

702
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,911
Hey, guys--

703
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,080
- Jesus Christ.
- Jesus!

704
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:58,626
Sorry. Franco has this crazy open floor plan.
I can hear every word you guys are saying.

705
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,045
I might as well hang with you guys
if that's cool.

706
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,755
- Nice.
- Coming in hot.

707
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,424
I gonna grab a blanket from you.

708
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:05,842
Give me that blanket.

709
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,677
- Get in the middle of it.
- That's good.

710
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,013
- That's it.
-It feels so much more safe now, guys.

711
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,222
It's nice here.

712
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,682
- Should we spoon it?
- Yeah, you want to?

713
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,891
- No!
- Want to go...

714
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:14,976
- Dick to butt?
- No.

715
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,021
- My butt to you and then Jay.
- I don't want to butt to dick to anything.

716
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,355
Are you docking into me?
You're doing tip to me?

717
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,608
- Or what are you doing?
- Should we go butt to butt or dick to...

718
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,943
Seth and I are gonna go ass to ass.
Do you want to go front to front?

719
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:27,280
- No, I'm fine just going dicks up.
-Dic:ks up?

720
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:28,823
- I think I'm going dick to ass.
- You know what?

721
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,950
I'm going Scarf ace-style.

722
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,285
- Both of you guys.
- Wait, yeah.

723
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,536
- There we go.
- Yeah.

724
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,621
This is the best way.

725
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,788
Good night, boys.

726
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:38,249
- Good night.
- Good night.

727
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,542
Good night, guys.

728
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,377
- Night, my sweet guys.
- Good night.

729
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:42,545
Sweet dreams, fellas.

730
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:29,258
Fuck,yeah.

731
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,627
Franco! Good morning, sunshine.

732
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:05,962
Guys! Guys! Wake up!

733
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,840
Danny's alive!
He's eating all the fucking food!

734
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,883
- No!
- Danny, man, don't.

735
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:12,802
Danny!

736
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:15,930
No, it's cool, man.
I fucking made this for you guys.

737
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,182
- Stop eating!
- Don't eat another piece of bacon.

738
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:19,392
Guys, just chill the fuck out, okay?

739
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:22,437
I'm sure the Green Goblin
can fucking afford some more bacon.

740
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,814
Dude, that shit's supposed to last us
till we get rescued!

741
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:28,317
Wait a second. I know what happened.

742
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,987
You guys dropped acid, didn't you?

743
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,281
Craig doesn't have any pants on.
He got fucking wild.

744
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,783
Probably danced, sweated all over the place.

745
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,160
You got white shit
all over your mouth, Franco.

746
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,536
You probably sucked somebody's dick.

747
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,414
Jonah over here probably watched
and jerked off.

748
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,624
Jay, I didn't even know you were in town.
Good to see you.

749
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,085
Danny, we're not on acid.
We didn't suck each other's dicks!

750
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:48,880
James Franco didn't suck
any dick last night?

751
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,506
Now I know y'all are tripping.

752
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,425
You actually not know
what happened last night?

753
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:55,094
Daniel, you may want
to stay seated for a second.

754
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:59,348
Some really messed-up stuff happened,
and there were a lot of fatalities.

755
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,101
Really? You're putting your serious voice on,
Jonah?

756
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:04,604
Okay, tell me about these "fatalities."

757
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,774
Dude, Segel's dead, Krumholtz
is dead, Michael Cera's dead.

758
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:11,527
Guess if Michael Cera's gone,
it's not a total loss, huh?

759
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,112
- Jesus, Danny.
- Michael Cera's dead.

760
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:14,906
- What?
-It's not like that.

761
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,699
- It's not funny, man.
-It's really not funny.

762
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,452
Seth, that's a better performance
than you've given in your last six movies.

763
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:21,245
Where the fuck was that
in <i>Green</i> Hornet, huh?

764
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,164
Jonah, you're fucking sucking balls.

765
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,832
You're an Academy Award nominated person.

766
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,293
You need to be fucking
selling that shit, dude.

767
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,420
"Fatalities. There were some fatalities."

768
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,172
Fatalities.

769
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:33,716
Okay, now that was good. That was good.

770
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,802
Does it seem like we're fucking joking?

771
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,471
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck you eating, man?

772
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,349
Spit it out your mouth. Give me the bacon!

773
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,023
Shit.

774
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,192
Shit, what do we do?

775
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,110
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

776
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,158
Should I shoot?

777
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:01,285
- Shut up, Franco!
- Shoot the door, Franco!

778
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:02,995
Oh, God!

779
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,665
Did you not hear me knocking out here?
I've been knocking forever.

780
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,625
Please! Please! You've got to let me in!

781
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,837
- Hang on a second.
- What?

782
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,925
Guys, I know it sounds really weird,
but I don't think we should let him in.

783
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,176
Why not?

784
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,970
Yeah, why not? I can hear you, by the way.

785
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,680
I'm sorry. We just don't know you, man.

786
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:24,183
You could be like, a looter,
or a rapist, or a tittie-fucker.

787
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,601
Like, I'm sorry.

788
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,521
Look, guys, we just boarded up
this whole house to keep everyone out,

789
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:31,148
and the first guy comes to the door,
we're gonna let him in?

790
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,775
I mean, how do we know
we can trust this guy?

791
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:35,611
I want to live!
Things have gone crazy out here!

792
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,906
"Fucking crazy out here!"
This guy fucking sucks.

793
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,242
- What if he's the rapist?
- Man, even if he is a rapist,

794
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,119
-he can't rape all of us.
- Yeah! No! So I'm not...

795
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,787
- I'm not a rapist!
- You want to tittie-fuck us?

796
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,623
If you want me to tittie-fuck you, I will!
So good! You'll love it.

797
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,000
Seth, back me up, please.

798
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,419
We can't just leave him out there to die.
Are you crazy?

799
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:53,462
What do you want to do?
I'll do whatever you want to do.

800
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:54,630
Let's vote on it.

801
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:56,507
Yeah, I fucking vote you let me in.

802
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:59,594
Here's my vote. Fuck all of you.
I'm letting him in. This is boring.

803
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:01,470
There's something out here!

804
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,729
This is real! This is fucking real!

805
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,564
God damn it!

806
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,829
You guys!

807
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:29,916
This man was alive a few seconds ago.
We can't play soccer with his head!

808
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,375
Pick it up, Jonah!

809
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:34,420
What the fuck is going on?

810
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,088
He blinked at me.

811
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,341
- He blinked at my face.
- Seth, put it over there.

812
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:40,885
Oh, my God!

813
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,219
I got it. I got it, guys.

814
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,680
There's blood all over my floor!

815
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,098
Time to relax for a second.

816
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:48,976
Okay, someone should look out the hole.

817
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,102
I ain't looking out that hole!

818
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,229
Last person looked through that hole
got his head chopped off!

819
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:56,525
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Whatever is out there might still be out there.

820
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,738
Okay, I know, I know.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

821
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:05,034
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

822
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:08,371
There's a lookout!

823
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,337
Jesus Christ! Look, there's
a huge fucking hole down there!

824
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,214
What the fuck is this?

825
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:21,467
- Where's the thing that killed the guy?
- I don't know.

826
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,053
- How'd his head fall off?
- And where's the rest of him?

827
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:31,894
<i>Hi.</i>

828
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:33,646
<i>This is James Franco,</i>

829
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,858
<i>in my house, in my library.</i>

830
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:41,362
<i>We've been stuck here for about 24 hours.</i>

831
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:43,823
<i>Danny McBride is here.</i>

832
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,324
<i>I didn't even invite him to my party,</i>

833
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,994
<i>but he came and passed out in the bathtub,</i>

834
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:51,163
<i>and I got to say
it's, like, typical fucking McBride.</i>

835
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:55,376
<i>Like, I've been feeling really weird
about him lately.</i>

836
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,421
<i>Like, I don't really know
if I want to be friends with him,</i>

837
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:02,341
<i>and then he fucking showed up at my party,</i>

838
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:07,054
<i>and now, we're stuck here with him
in disaster lockdown, so...</i>

839
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,060
<i>- What up? What's going on?
-Hey, Danny. What's up, man?</i>

840
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:15,646
<i>Not much. What are you doing? What is this?</i>

841
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,190
<i>It's just a video confessional.</i>

842
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,282
<i>Fuck that dude.</i>

843
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,784
- Earthquakes cause tsunamis.
- Yes.

844
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:31,287
Tsunamis cause other tsunamis, disaster.

845
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,372
I mean, for all we know,
the fucking Lakers could have just won,

846
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,832
and that's the reason
why all this is happening.

847
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:36,876
Hole in Franco's front yard? Sinkhole.

848
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:40,337
Every single time I turn on the news,
sinkhole in South America.

849
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,048
Bunch of South Americans
getting sucked into the ground.

850
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,549
- Sinkhole de Mayo.
- Sinkhole de Mayo.

851
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:44,675
That's why it's named that,

852
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,343
because sinkholes happen
in the summertime.

853
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:50,431
It's not wildfires. It's not earthquakes.
It's not sinkholes.

854
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,725
- I think I know what it is.
- Let's hear it.

855
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,936
I think it's the Apocalypse.

856
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,480
What?

857
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:03,360
I'm serious, boys.
It's all in here, in the Book of Revelations.

858
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:05,488
- You took my Bible?
- Well, just hear me out,

859
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:09,658
and you tell me that what I'm describing
isn't what's going on right now.

860
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:13,412
"And the skies shall open up,
and the light of the Lord shall shine down,

861
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:16,248
"and those of good heart shall be brought
into my kingdom of heaven."

862
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:20,711
That's the Rapture,
those are the gigantic beams of blue light.

863
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:23,130
"And there will be a great
mountain burning in fire."

864
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:26,634
I mean, the Hollywood Hills
are literally engulfed in flames

865
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:28,135
as we sit here right now.

866
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:30,763
The Hollywood Hills ain't no mountain.
It's a hill.

867
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:33,265
Takes about 10 minutes to get across
that motherfucker with no traffic.

868
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,558
- Coldwater.
- I take Laurel Canyon.

869
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:35,601
- Cahuenga.
- Cahuenga.

870
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,561
- I usually zip down Barham.
- Boys, can I just fucking finish?

871
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:38,938
I love Laurel Canyon.

872
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:42,858
"And out of the pit
rose a great red dragon having seven heads,

873
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:45,694
"that old serpent called the devil and Satan,

874
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:51,283
"which deceiveth the whole world,
was released onto the earth."

875
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,578
<i>I love that</i> dude.
<i>He's from Where the Wild Things Are.</i>

876
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:56,789
-It's a load of bullshit.
-It's not bullshit.

877
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,165
Want to know something else, Jay?

878
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:01,001
If this is the end of the world,
and all the good people died,

879
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:05,297
what you're saying is
Seth, me, Jonah, Craig and Danny

880
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:06,382
are a bunch of assholes.

881
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,634
I'm straight-up lovable, son.

882
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:12,471
And if this really is the Apocalypse,

883
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:13,597
you're here too.

884
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:17,560
So, that means you're just
as shitty as the rest of us.

885
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:19,770
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

886
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,825
Hey, guys. I'm going to sleep now.

887
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,285
Nobody come in here and bother me.

888
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,911
Go fish.

889
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,663
Put it back inside of here.

890
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,665
- Do you know what it is?
- Yeah.

891
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,959
Now you ask me
for something that you need.

892
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,460
First bit.

893
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:44,837
You're not cutting it all?

894
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,631
That's smart. You're divvying it up first.

895
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,758
- This is like, Fruyére or some shit.
- That's me.

896
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:50,843
Come on, Danny!

897
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,261
- You licked your finger.
- Come on, man.

898
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,513
If they're all equal, what does it matter?

899
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:55,973
Keep your hands and fingers off.

900
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,016
- Seth?
- Yeah.

901
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,809
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, yeah.

902
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,269
Yeah, no shit.

903
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,149
Here. Off the menu, my man.

904
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,527
Holy shit, man. Where did you get these?

905
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:12,114
Hey, what's cheese without a few crackers?
Know what I'm saying?

906
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:14,074
- Hide it.
- Okay.

907
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,871
-'Cause we're a team.
- Okay.

908
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,831
Freaks forever, brother.

909
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,126
Let's do all the drugs.

910
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,045
I don't really want to.

911
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:29,465
Should have thought of that
before you drank a can full of ecstasy.

912
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:30,633
What?

913
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:20,266
<i>Should we call Red? Get more weed?</i>

914
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:23,102
<i>I don't know, man. That guy's gone crazy.</i>

915
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:27,439
<i>Good thing I have a lot
of fucking weed for you guys.</i>

916
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,775
<i>I hooked you guys UP-</i>

917
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:33,737
<i>Now I need you guys
to assassinate Woody Harrelson.</i>

918
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:36,448
<i>If pot's legalized, my business will suffer.</i>

919
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:38,826
<i>And if my business suffers, I suffer.</i>

920
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:39,994
<i>So much suffering.</i>

921
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:42,913
<i>All 'cause of that inbred hemp seed,
Woody Harrelson.</i>

922
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:44,832
<i>I have to do what's right.</i>

923
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:47,376
<i>Weed is for the people.
It's the people's weed.</i>

924
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,628
<i>- If you don't assassinate him...
-We already quit.</i>

925
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:52,256
<i>...I'm gonna assassinate both of you.</i>

926
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,675
<i>"Run!
"Go!</i>

927
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:03,892
<i>B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F. forever.</i>

928
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:05,227
<i>B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.</i>

929
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,526
<i>- Look out!
-Shit!</i>

930
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:15,612
<i>You're letting them get away!</i>

931
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:22,786
<i>I smoked weed with Steve Jobs,</i>

932
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,122
<i>and that's when he came up with the iPad.</i>

933
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,416
<i>It's pretty great.</i>

934
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,209
We should make sequels
to more of our movies.

935
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:30,336
Yeah!

936
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:32,004
<i>How 'bout we not do Your Highness 2?</i>

937
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,589
<i>- Yeah.
- Do 128 Hours.</i>

938
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,592
- The beginning of the rest of your comedies.
- Looks good.

939
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:41,263
Oh, my God!

940
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:50,022
- Emma!
-It's Emma.

941
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:52,649
Oh, my God, you guys are alive.

942
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:54,985
You're actually alive. Thank God!

943
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:57,821
I hid in a drainpipe for days.

944
00:44:57,905 --> 00:45:00,783
Like, three or four.
I don't even know how many.

945
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:04,119
And then I stopped hearing people,
and I started hearing growling noises.

946
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:07,581
Out there, in your travels,

947
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:08,957
did you see anything
that you would describe

948
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,542
as Apocalyptish?

949
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,378
I mean, no,

950
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:17,257
but I would say it's completely obvious
what's going on here.

951
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,885
I mean, it's a zombie invasion.

952
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:21,637
- Fuck!
- I'm the one who said it's been zombies.

953
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,472
- You said zombies?
- I said zombies the whole time.

954
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,808
- You said zombies?
- I don't think... You never said zombies.

955
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,935
Wait a second.
You guys haven't been proven right.

956
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,228
These are still just theories.

957
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,897
Honestly, I'm just so relieved
that you guys are here,

958
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,983
and I'm very happy
about the idea of sleeping and just...

959
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,068
- You tired?
- Yeah.

960
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,904
If you want to take a little rest,

961
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,989
you're welcome to do that upstairs.

962
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,366
- Thank you.
- Cool.

963
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:43,992
- I'll show you the way.
- Thank you.

964
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:45,994
Thanks, guys.
Seriously, you're awesome, really.

965
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:47,621
You're awesome.

966
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:49,498
So fucking tight.

967
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,834
We'll be right out here, okay?

968
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:54,420
Fuck are you guys doing out here?

969
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:56,713
Here's what I think we should do.
She's British, right?

970
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:58,507
She's used to eating shitty food anyway.

971
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,467
Let's just give her all the shitty food
that we don't want.

972
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:02,094
That's fucked up. Look how tiny she is.

973
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,096
She's not even a full seven.
She's, like, half a seven.

974
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,431
This is a fucking cool thing, man.

975
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:08,767
I, for one, am very excited.
I'm a massive <i>Harry</i> Potter fan.

976
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:10,936
- What?
- Yes. I love fucking <i>Harry</i> Potter.

977
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,189
I cannot wait till she wakes up and I can
ask her all these amazing questions about

978
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:15,482
how they made those motion pictures.

979
00:46:15,566 --> 00:46:16,608
Take it easy, Dumbledore.

980
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:21,363
Guys, listen, listen. I think we need
to address the elephant in the room.

981
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,198
Whoa. Jay, don't talk about Craig like that.

982
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:24,825
- That's fucked up. I'm right here, man.
- Yeah.

983
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:27,035
I'm not calling Craig an elephant.

984
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,121
- Wow, that's fucking weird.
- What does that even mean?

985
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,456
- Yeah, no.
- That's racist.

986
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:31,623
I wasn't referring to him.

987
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:35,127
I was referring to the issue
that's on all of our minds.

988
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,462
What?

989
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:39,882
This is one girl in a house with six males.

990
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,133
Yeah. Really safe.

991
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,301
Ideal scenario.

992
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:43,469
She's like a little sister.

993
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:45,012
I think that she needs...

994
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,805
It's important that she feels safe.

995
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:48,348
- Yeah.
- And comfortable.

996
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:49,808
And we should be mindful.

997
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:51,185
Who's making her not feel safe?

998
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:52,728
Well, I'm just saying, we should...

999
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:55,147
We don't want to give off a bad vibe.

1000
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,773
- Vibe?
- Vibes? I ain't giving no vibes.

1001
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,484
Yeah, wait, what kind of vibes
are you talking about, man?

1002
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,444
He's talking about us giving off a rapey vibe.

1003
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,154
- Hey!
- What?

1004
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:04,031
- Jesus.
- Jay, what the fuck, man?

1005
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:05,282
Chill out, dude.

1006
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:07,242
- Why you putting that shit in the mix?
- Yeah.

1007
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:09,077
- He fucking said it.
- You're the one saying it.

1008
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:10,537
No one here is thinking about raping anyone.

1009
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,289
Well, you talking about vibes

1010
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,209
is the only thing that's rapey
going on right now.

1011
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:17,211
Dude, nothing was rapey till
you brought up the rapey vibes.

1012
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,296
- Fucking one who smelt it dealt it, dawg.
- True that, dude.

1013
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:20,756
One who denies it supplies it.

1014
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,841
I know, it's farts, I get it.

1015
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:24,092
Guys, guys, guYs-

1016
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:25,761
Jay's not rapey.

1017
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,262
Jay couldn't rape a fly.

1018
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:29,097
He probably could.

1019
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:31,058
Maybe we should just stop this
entire conversation right now.

1020
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:34,228
If anyone's gonna rape anyone here,
it's probably gonna be Danny.

1021
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:35,729
- What the fuck, Franco?
- What?

1022
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,189
Why do you think I'm gonna rape somebody?

1023
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,149
I'm just trying to lay it out there.

1024
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,609
I'm not gonna rape anyone, all right?

1025
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:41,902
If anyone's gonna rape somebody, it's Jay.

1026
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,612
- What?
- He came up with the rape idea.

1027
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:44,863
And his face looks like the police sketch

1028
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:46,073
-of a fucking rapist.
- True.

1029
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:47,366
What the fuck does that mean?

1030
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:50,285
If anybody's raping Emma Watson,
it's fucking Sir Rapes-a-Lot over here.

1031
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:51,453
- Chill out.
- Hey!

1032
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:53,872
Easy. Easy.

1033
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:55,040
Back the fuck up!

1034
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,416
- Emma.
- What's wrong?

1035
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,543
- Wait, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1036
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,337
I just heard you guys talking about
which one of you is gonna get to rape me.

1037
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,797
No,no,no,no!

1038
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,340
Guys, I got it. I got it.

1039
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,676
No. It's funny. It's funny.

1040
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:07,636
We were specifically talking
about not raping you.

1041
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:10,097
- Jesus!
- Holy shit!

1042
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,932
Back up!

1043
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:13,976
It's me, Jonah!

1044
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,519
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1045
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,188
America's sweetheart. J-bug, J-bone.

1046
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:19,815
- Your friend. I would never hurt you.
- Get back!

1047
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,735
Give me everything you have to drink!
Put it in the bag!

1048
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,612
There's six of us. You cannot rob us!

1049
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:26,905
I'm not fucking around!

1050
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:29,700
Give her drinks! Give her drinks!

1051
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:31,118
Put the drinks in a bag!

1052
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:33,287
- Oh, God.
- Get all the drinks in a bag!

1053
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,663
Hurry the fuck up!

1054
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:35,956
Okay, they're getting the drinks.

1055
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,083
- Put the ax down.
- Don't give the Milky Way away.

1056
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,085
All right, you can put the ax down now.

1057
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,253
Now, Franco! Shoot her face!

1058
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:42,421
Shoot her!

1059
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:44,089
I'm not gonna shoot Emma Watson!

1060
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,799
Look, Emma, just stay here with us.

1061
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,509
It's a lot safer than out there.

1062
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,101
<i>Hermione just stole all of our shit.</i>

1063
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:59,896
<i>Little bitty-ass 20-year-old jacked us.</i>

1064
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,275
<i>And then Jay suggested that we all rape her,
and now she's gone.</i>

1065
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,694
<i>I didn't... I was just... I...</i>

1066
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:08,864
<i>I think the only reason why
he did that is because Jay knows</i>

1067
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:12,034
<i>he's about fucking two minutes away
from becoming the house bitch himself.</i>

1068
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:16,038
<i>So now, motherfuckers is thirsty.</i>

1069
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:18,123
All right, guys-

1070
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:21,460
The door to the basement's out there,
around the side of the house.

1071
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:24,838
I know for sure there's at least
two jugs of water.

1072
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,381
Okay.

1073
00:49:28,342 --> 00:49:29,635
Any volunteers?

1074
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:31,094
Does anyone want to volunteer
and go with Jay?

1075
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:32,638
What?

1076
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,640
I thought you said, "Someone volunteer
to go with me out there."

1077
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:35,766
I must have misheard you.

1078
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,768
- I'm sorry.
- You did not, you motherfucker.

1079
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:39,227
Hey, okay, ease up.

1080
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:41,897
Just chill out, dude. Just relax, man. God.

1081
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,815
So how we gonna decide this, fellas?

1082
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:46,276
All right, guys, it's simple.

1083
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,780
Whoever pulls the burnt match
has to go get the water.

1084
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:00,916
Who wants to go first?

1085
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,210
I'll do it.

1086
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:04,419
Craig.

1087
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:06,088
All right.

1088
00:50:07,089 --> 00:50:08,507
Go ahead, brother.

1089
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:16,765
No whammies, no whammies.

1090
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:19,601
- Hey, hey.
- Yes! Yeah!

1091
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:21,561
_Fu°k,ye$I
'Yés!

1092
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:23,772
Fuck, yes. Fuck, yes.

1093
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,899
- So sorry, Craig.
- A lot of guys in here

1094
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,275
that I wish it was instead of you.

1095
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,487
You want to go best two out of three?

1096
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,074
If I tug, if I pull in anyway,
or if you hear me screaming,

1097
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:36,576
anything, you pull me right back in, all right?

1098
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,495
Yeah. We'll try, man, but you're pretty heavy.

1099
00:50:39,121 --> 00:50:40,288
What?

1100
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:43,125
No, I mean, I'm saying,
I just don't think it's smart

1101
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,626
-to make any guarantees.
- Fuck,no.

1102
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,420
- You promise to pull me back in.
- No, no, we're...

1103
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:47,587
- You got me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1104
00:50:47,671 --> 00:50:49,047
- We're gonna do our best.
- All right.

1105
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:50,716
- You want to do a test run?
- Yeah.

1106
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:52,259
You gotta scream. Let us hear the scream.

1107
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:54,094
Pull.

1108
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,595
Nice. Very nice.

1109
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:56,805
Everyone thank Craig for doing this.

1110
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,640
- Thanks, Craig.
- Thank you, Craig.

1111
00:50:58,724 --> 00:50:59,725
Go for it, Craig.

1112
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:01,810
Getting smoky in here. Go, go, go, go.

1113
00:51:05,439 --> 00:51:07,149
This is fucked up.

1114
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:19,661
Goddamn.

1115
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:21,747
Smoky as fuck out here.

1116
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,725
Rope burn!

1117
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:43,477
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

1118
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,811
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1119
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:45,937
- Shit.
- Oh, no.

1120
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:48,023
Shit. Shit.

1121
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,991
Come on, motherfucker. Shit!

1122
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:02,579
Fuck this shit.

1123
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:11,338
Fellas, fellas! Pull me in! Pull the rope!

1124
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:13,006
- Pull me in!
- We don't have the rope anymore!

1125
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,382
We fucking dropped it! We're sorry!

1126
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:15,634
You've got the rope, man!

1127
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,052
What?

1128
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:24,267
- Craig!
- What the fuck do we do?

1129
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:26,102
Craig! Craig!

1130
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:28,897
Are you okay?

1131
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,981
What happened, man?

1132
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:31,566
I don't know! There's something out there.

1133
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:36,613
Oh, shit!

1134
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,785
A knife! Somebody throw me a knife!

1135
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:43,161
I'll get it.

1136
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:49,084
- Why?
- OMG.

1137
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,669
Jay, I'm so sorry, bro.

1138
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:51,753
The fuck?

1139
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,090
Cut it! Cut it! Cut it! Cut it! Cut it!

1140
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:58,969
God! What the fuck was that?

1141
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:01,388
I don't know what the fuck that was,
but I ain't going back out there.

1142
00:53:01,471 --> 00:53:02,556
Craig, you didn't even get any of the water.

1143
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:03,640
The door was fucked up.

1144
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,892
Damn it, this is so frustrating!

1145
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:08,228
It's so close, but so far.

1146
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:11,398
The water, it's, like, right underneath us.

1147
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:13,108
Like, right there.

1148
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,944
What do you mean "right underneath us"?

1149
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:19,322
Like, literally, like, right there.

1150
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:21,032
If you went right through the floor.

1151
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:34,671
Yo.

1152
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:39,175
Danny and Jonah's shift ends in ten minutes,
so our break is almost over.

1153
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:41,177
Okay.

1154
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:42,637
Let me ask you something.

1155
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,641
You really think this is

1156
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:48,184
the Apocalypse?

1157
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:50,770
You saw something out there, didn't you?

1158
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:56,276
All right, let's just say
for sake of argument, what if I did?

1159
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,486
What if this is the real shit,
right now, happening?

1160
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,990
What if it is, man?
We're not prepared for this.

1161
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:03,992
- What do we do? What's next?
-It says in the Bible,

1162
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,994
"The worthy will ascend to Heaven."

1163
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:11,291
Even if it is
the Apocalypse, it's not the end of us.

1164
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:12,918
There's still hope.

1165
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:16,254
We just have to somehow
try to prove our worthiness.

1166
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:18,590
Okay, so, you mean, like,

1167
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:22,135
like the Ten Commandments,
like, do shit unto people

1168
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:23,428
that'll do the same shit to you.

1169
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,221
That's a great place to start.

1170
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:26,723
You know, to just overall love.

1171
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:29,893
Just be nicer
and follow those commandments.

1172
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:33,647
Listen. We're gonna get through this.
We're gonna get through this, man.

1173
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:36,399
You know why?
'Cause we're gonna do it together.

1174
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:37,692
You promise?

1175
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:39,027
We're gonna do this.

1176
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:42,781
I hear everything.

1177
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,834
Who did this?

1178
00:54:54,918 --> 00:54:56,294
Who did this?

1179
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:58,588
Did what? What are you talking about?

1180
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:01,299
Jizzed all over the pages
of this nice magazine

1181
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:03,301
I was nice enough to tell you about.

1182
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:05,053
Was it you, Seth?

1183
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,262
No.

1184
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:07,764
- No?
-It was me, Franco.

1185
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,975
I fucking made jizz in your magazine.

1186
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:11,851
- Why?
- When I fucking jack off

1187
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:13,645
long enough, I end upjizzing, dude.

1188
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:16,272
I'm assuming the same shit works for you?

1189
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:18,984
Real fucking smart answer!
Why don't you fucking aim, huh?

1190
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:22,278
I have a particularly explosive ejaculate.
It just goes everywhere.

1191
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:24,239
It's like a fucking wild fireman's hose.

1192
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:27,283
You just got to grab on and pray to God
it doesn't get in your eyes or your mouth.

1193
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:30,078
The fuck kind of jerking off is that?
What, you never had any brothers?

1194
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,747
You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking sock
or on a fucking tissue?

1195
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:36,126
No, I don't have any brothers.
I was raised in a house of women!

1196
00:55:36,209 --> 00:55:37,961
I highly doubt they fucking taught you

1197
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:40,672
to fucking close your eyes
and fucking cum wherever you want!

1198
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:43,425
I mean, you're getting all worked up
over a fucking porno mag!

1199
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,760
Who has goddamn porno mags anymore?

1200
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:48,179
Welcome to the 21st century, Buck Rogers!

1201
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:51,099
You designed a house with
fucking iPads in the walls,

1202
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:53,601
yet you're jerking your dick
like a goddamn pilgrim!

1203
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:56,187
That's right, man. I like to fucking read!

1204
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:58,314
You think that's the only thing
ljerked off in here?

1205
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:01,609
I've been dropping loads around this
fucking house like a goddamn dump truck.

1206
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:03,153
You don't cum on my stuff!

1207
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:06,197
I'll cum wherever the fuck I want, James.
I'll fucking cum in your kitchen.

1208
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:09,117
I'll cum on your fucking art.
I'll cum anywhere I want!

1209
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,869
I will fucking cum right on you!

1210
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:13,329
I will cum like a fucking
madman all over you, McBride!

1211
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:17,584
I fucking wish you'd cum on me right now.
I fucking dare you to cum on me!

1212
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:20,086
God!

1213
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,380
I'm gonna jack my dick
so fucking hard in here!

1214
00:56:22,464 --> 00:56:25,008
This, no more, man.
All over your fucking face.

1215
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,135
This fucking all more.
All over the fucking place!

1216
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,845
I'll fucking cum anywhere I want!

1217
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,806
I'll fucking cum on these walls!
I'll cum on the fucking cabinets!

1218
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,433
On the fucking furniture!
I'll cum everywhere!

1219
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:36,728
If I see your dick one more time,
I'm gonna fucking shoot it off!

1220
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,605
You don't have enough bullets, bitch.

1221
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:41,191
No fucking jerking off in my house, McBride!

1222
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:45,945
- Come on, man.
- Fuck this.

1223
00:56:46,029 --> 00:56:47,697
I'm just... I'm too thirsty to do this.

1224
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:51,284
And the fucking bitter irony is I'm not gonna
have my thirst quenched until I finish this.

1225
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:52,869
- God damn it, I hate it.
- Danny, no.

1226
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,370
Don't walk away.
Danny, don't walk away from me!

1227
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:57,499
It's too late, Seth.
I've already walked away too much.

1228
00:56:57,582 --> 00:56:59,334
No, you haven't. You could still come back

1229
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,961
and just fucking turn around
and come back and help me.

1230
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,173
Danny?

1231
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:07,092
Daniel?

1232
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,685
Need a hand?

1233
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,562
Yeah, dude.

1234
00:57:19,646 --> 00:57:20,605
Your shift just ended, man.

1235
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,065
You don't have to help me
if you don't want to.

1236
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:23,316
It's fine, I get it.

1237
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,151
The fuck else am I doing?

1238
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:27,362
I appreciate it, man. Thank you.

1239
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,863
- Done and done.
- That's cool.

1240
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:37,747
I don't know why I'm thinking of this,
but remember that time

1241
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:41,626
that I got you a fucking
Taco Bell gift certificate

1242
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:45,463
for, like, 20 bucks, and I bet you
that you couldn't eat all of that in one sitting.

1243
00:57:45,547 --> 00:57:47,340
I do remember that. I remember thinking,

1244
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:50,093
"How much food could 20 dollars
possibly buy you at Taco Bell?"

1245
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:51,594
And the answer is infinite.

1246
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:53,680
And we went to see fucking Gladiator.

1247
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:57,308
- Yeah.
- And you sharted midway through the movie.

1248
00:57:57,392 --> 00:57:59,060
- I did.
- Due to the tigers' appearance.

1249
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:00,687
- I got scared of the tigers.
- Yeah.

1250
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,230
Literally, when the second
tiger came out, I went...

1251
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,690
...and then I shat.

1252
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:05,066
I shat in the theater.

1253
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:14,075
- Jesus.
- Oh, fuck.

1254
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:15,577
You guys Okay?

1255
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,287
- I broke my ass in half.
- Here.

1256
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,872
Shit, they got through!

1257
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:21,166
- You guys fucking did it.
- Oh, my God.

1258
00:58:21,249 --> 00:58:23,585
- Fuck. Did that hurt?
- Yes, it fucking hurt.

1259
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,670
I loosened this up for you,
I'll have you know.

1260
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,547
Okay, just shut up.
It's fucking dark down here.

1261
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,091
Hold on, hold on.

1262
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,093
Nice.

1263
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:34,095
- Okay, good. Thank you.
- What is that?

1264
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,890
That's Terrence Peterson.
My monkey flashlight keychain.

1265
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:38,641
Monkey flashlight keychain?

1266
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:40,268
- What's his name?
- Terrence Peterson.

1267
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,769
- You see it, Seth?
- No. Where...

1268
00:58:41,853 --> 00:58:43,146
Are you sure it's even down here?

1269
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:44,272
Terry Pete.

1270
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,690
Not sure.

1271
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,066
Is there, is there any weird shit down here?

1272
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:50,028
Nah, it's where I keep
all my stuff from my old movies.

1273
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:51,362
Costumes, props.

1274
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:04,292
- What?
-ls someone down there?

1275
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,545
It's your fucking stupid
cutout from Spider-Man 3.

1276
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:09,172
Jesus Christ.

1277
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:10,298
No shit!

1278
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:11,466
- There it is!
- Yes! Yeah!

1279
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,468
- What, did you find it?
- Yeah!

1280
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:25,730
Water.

1281
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:31,069
That is so fucking good.

1282
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:32,612
The two heroes over here,
breaking through the floor.

1283
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:34,197
We did break through the floor.

1284
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,199
Any of you guys would
have done the same thing.

1285
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:38,618
Oh, man. That fucking hurt.

1286
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:40,828
Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't shart again.

1287
00:59:40,912 --> 00:59:42,080
I think I did.

1288
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:43,998
Hey, what year is this? 19...

1289
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:45,667
That's a good... That's a good year.

1290
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,043
Hey, hey. Yo, yo, yo!

1291
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:48,795
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

1292
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:50,004
What am I doing?

1293
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:52,757
Fuck, man.

1294
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,759
I'm just pouring myself
another glass of water

1295
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,803
to wash down that dry-ass
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

1296
00:59:56,886 --> 00:59:59,847
That's very nice, but you can't just
pour yourself another glass of water, man!

1297
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:01,015
Will you cut it out?

1298
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:03,351
- Yeah.
- We agreed to one glass at dinner,

1299
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:04,602
we voted on it, man.

1300
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:07,355
Well, man, I'm just getting sick and tired
of all these fucking rules, man.

1301
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:08,856
You don't see me putting rules on you guys.

1302
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,276
You cannot have another glass of water.

1303
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,403
Jay weighs 150 pounds less than me.

1304
01:00:13,486 --> 01:00:15,363
Why the fuck is it fair

1305
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,323
that him and I should drink
the same amount of water?

1306
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:21,077
We should be dividing our rations
based on our proportionate size.

1307
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,621
I don't want to come off
as a diva here or anything.

1308
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:26,332
It's just that I think everyone
should split everything equally.

1309
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:28,584
"I just think that everybody
should have the fucking same.

1310
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:30,753
"I have a goddamn earring."
Shut the fuck up, Jonah!

1311
01:00:30,837 --> 01:00:34,465
You know what, Danny? If you weren'tjizzing
all the time, maybe you'd be more hydrated.

1312
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:36,175
You're making me into a joke
right now, Franco,

1313
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:38,052
and you are not gonna like
the fucking punch line.

1314
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:41,055
No more jerking off! No more water!
Just sit the fuck down!

1315
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:42,432
Okay, I'm done.

1316
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:43,725
We're not gonna have any more water.

1317
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:44,809
- Good.
- All right.

1318
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,396
Hey!

1319
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,405
Someone help me! Fucking grab it!

1320
01:01:00,158 --> 01:01:01,409
What are you doing?

1321
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:02,493
You guys made this happen!

1322
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:05,038
You guys forced my fucking hand
by ganging up on me.

1323
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:08,082
God damn it, I'm gonna fucking
kill this motherfucker!

1324
01:01:10,168 --> 01:01:12,587
That's what I thought. Nerd.

1325
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,801
All right, guys,

1326
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,053
let's get rid of him.

1327
01:01:20,136 --> 01:01:21,429
What? What do you mean?

1328
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,056
Like, kick him out of the house?

1329
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:25,892
His fucking reckless behavior is
dragging us all down.

1330
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,977
I mean, he wasted our water twice.

1331
01:01:28,061 --> 01:01:29,937
Two times. Two times.

1332
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:32,523
Dan is under a lot of pressure. Okay?

1333
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:34,359
And he's not handling it
as good as the rest of us are.

1334
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:37,153
Look at him.
He's wearing my fucking tuxedo.

1335
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,821
He's been eating nonstop.

1336
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:41,282
The fucker's gained weight since he got here.

1337
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:43,368
The fucker's got to go.

1338
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:44,452
Go.

1339
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,120
The fucker's got to go.

1340
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,210
This is how you all feel?

1341
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:53,544
We talked about it.

1342
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:56,506
You guys are gonna vote me off the island?

1343
01:01:56,589 --> 01:01:59,509
I mean, I made you guys breakfast.

1344
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:01,886
Shit, man, you wasted half
of our food when you did that.

1345
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:04,680
Just thought I was doing
something nice for you guys.

1346
01:02:04,764 --> 01:02:08,059
Just to apologize
for my behavior at the party.

1347
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,477
Party I wasn't even invited to.

1348
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,771
I'm not an idiot.

1349
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,857
I know why you guys don't fucking call me
or hang outwith me anymore.

1350
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:17,985
It's because I party so fucking hard.

1351
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:21,489
Always have. Ever since I was a baby.

1352
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:23,282
I wouldn't just suck on my mama's titties.

1353
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:26,494
I would fucking bang 'em and motorboat 'em.

1354
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:31,207
Everything I've been doing
has just been a cry for help.

1355
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,085
When I came on your magazine, James,

1356
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,129
it was a cum for help.

1357
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:40,007
I've just been crying and c:omin'
and crying and c:omin',

1358
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:42,927
tears from the tip of my penis, dudes.

1359
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:45,972
I'm sorry, all right?
You can cum wherever you want.

1360
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:48,474
I don't even care about coming anymore.

1361
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:52,437
Right now, I'm just kind of into going.

1362
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,273
- Danny.
- Danny.

1363
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,441
- Hey.
- Come on, man.

1364
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:58,025
I fucked up.

1365
01:02:58,109 --> 01:02:59,402
I'm sorry, man. Come on, look,

1366
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,154
- I was wrong.
- I feel like shit, man.

1367
01:03:01,237 --> 01:03:02,738
I didn't want it to happen like this.

1368
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:05,283
- Let's just discuss it some more, okay?
- Yeah. Let's just talk, dude.

1369
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:08,035
We're giving you an option.
It's a choice, man.

1370
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,954
There's nothing to figure out, all right?

1371
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:12,707
You guys have said enough,
and there's no going back anymore.

1372
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:16,878
I don't know if there maybe is, like,
something you guys could give me

1373
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:19,547
so I could at least have some sort of
protection while I'm out there.

1374
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,966
Danny, you don't have to do this.

1375
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:23,426
- Yeah, man.
- All right,

1376
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:24,719
if you're really leaving

1377
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:28,139
then you should take this.

1378
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:29,891
Really?

1379
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:32,268
You don't know what's out there.

1380
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:37,273
Thank you, James.

1381
01:03:38,149 --> 01:03:41,569
It means a lot to you,
and I appreciate that you'd give this to me,

1382
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:43,488
you stupid, stupid motherfucker!

1383
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:49,577
Fucking psychopath. It's a prop gun!

1384
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,204
What, do you think
I'd put real bullets in here?

1385
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:53,581
You were gonna send me out there
with a fucking gun

1386
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:54,707
-filled with blanks?
- Fuck you!

1387
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,042
Don't turn this around on us.

1388
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,127
You just tried to shoot us,
you fucking dickhead!

1389
01:03:58,211 --> 01:03:59,253
Fucking murdering motherfucker!

1390
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:01,672
Whatever.
Fucking civilization is broken down.

1391
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:04,175
There's no more reason
for this false bullshit.

1392
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,177
You guys act like you're
so fucking high and mighty,

1393
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,513
like you've never made
a goddamn mistake before.

1394
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:10,556
Franco, you're just
a pretentious fucking nerd.

1395
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,682
Fuck you.

1396
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:12,850
And, Jonah,

1397
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:14,268
you fucking cunt.

1398
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,065
Craig, you didn't have my back, back there.

1399
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:21,275
- You fuckin' disappoint me.
- Bro.

1400
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,111
And, Seth, you duplicitous taint.

1401
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:27,114
- What?
- Then of course, there's Jay,

1402
01:04:27,198 --> 01:04:30,743
the self-righteous,
cock-sucking, two-faced backstabber.

1403
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:32,578
What the fuck are you talking about?

1404
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:34,413
I overheard your little
conversation with Craig, all right?

1405
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:36,791
The only reason
why you care about any of us is

1406
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:38,501
because you think
that's what God wants you to do.

1407
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:39,961
You don't give a shit about us.

1408
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:43,256
No, no, no, no, that's fucking
twisting that shit... You're fucking lying.

1409
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:44,674
Am I twisting this?

1410
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:49,512
I believe you were in Los Angeles
two months ago, at the Four Seasons.

1411
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:53,099
I saw you there, and you specifically
asked me not to tell Seth,

1412
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:57,228
so that you could maintain the illusion
that you always stay with Seth

1413
01:04:57,311 --> 01:04:58,396
when you're in Los Angeles.

1414
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:02,358
Jay.

1415
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:04,151
- Fuck, man.
-It's not...

1416
01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:06,571
Textbook twattage.

1417
01:05:06,654 --> 01:05:08,656
And just for the record, you guys,

1418
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:10,992
I'm choosing to leave,
you're not kicking me out.

1419
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:13,202
You guys had already said that
I could come back in

1420
01:05:13,286 --> 01:05:15,496
and I'm the one who said
that I'm not coming back in.

1421
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,831
Don't be cocky.

1422
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:23,629
Get the fuck out of here.

1423
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:26,966
Is that true?

1424
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:30,094
Yes.

1425
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:31,512
J3Y--'

1426
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:35,725
I know this is probably my fault
because I put you on a pedestal,

1427
01:05:35,808 --> 01:05:38,477
but you should not be
dishonest with your friends.

1428
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:40,646
But you really let me down.

1429
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:43,274
- Hey! Whoa!
- Jay, damn, man.

1430
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:45,735
- Fucken
- What the hell?

1431
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:47,695
It's all fucked, isn't it?

1432
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:49,780
- Jonah, you okay?
- Yeah.

1433
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:51,574
Bleeding?

1434
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:56,370
Yeah.

1435
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:02,918
His insides hurt worse than my outsides.

1436
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:12,053
Dear God,

1437
01:06:13,763 --> 01:06:16,057
I'd like to pray to You for a second.

1438
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,808
It's me, Jonah Hill.

1439
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,479
<i>From Moneyball.</i>

1440
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:28,194
I hate Jay so fucking much.

1441
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:31,238
I think he might be the worst person
You ever created.

1442
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:34,825
I don't want to judge You, but...

1443
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:38,162
What's up? What were You thinking that day?

1444
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:42,792
I love Seth, I love being his friend,
he's an awesome guy,

1445
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:48,756
but it's like Jay is the last connection
to his shitty, weird Canadian life.

1446
01:06:49,924 --> 01:06:51,676
Just do me one favor, God.

1447
01:06:53,886 --> 01:06:55,638
Just kill Jay.

1448
01:06:58,057 --> 01:06:59,642
That'd be so tight.

1449
01:07:57,867 --> 01:07:59,744
Stop, man.

1450
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:01,996
Seriously, Craig, stop.

1451
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:04,415
Your nails are sharp.

1452
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:17,678
This is no dream!

1453
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:20,931
This is really happening!

1454
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,058
No!

1455
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:39,742
<i>Something not that chill happened last night.</i>

1456
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:45,039
<i>Yo, so, I just drank
my own pee for the first time.</i>

1457
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:50,127
<i>And it ain't bad. I never thought to do it.</i>

1458
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:53,380
<i>I always thought, you know,
pee stink, whatever, but...</i>

1459
01:09:11,315 --> 01:09:13,234
I think we all remember how this works.

1460
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:15,486
Whoever gets the burnt match
has to go to one of Franco's

1461
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,488
neighbors' houses,
get us some food and some water.

1462
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:19,406
No-ho-ho. No, I'm not going first.

1463
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,950
<i>- I'll</i> go first.
- Thank you.

1464
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:22,785
Very mature of you. Thank you.

1465
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:28,582
Yes!

1466
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,417
Sorry.

1467
01:09:31,502 --> 01:09:32,503
Good job.

1468
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:37,424
You okay, Jonah?

1469
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:38,551
What's that?

1470
01:09:38,634 --> 01:09:39,718
You Okay?

1471
01:09:40,386 --> 01:09:43,222
Yeah. Just bad sleep. Crazy dream.

1472
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:44,598
Here, Jonah.

1473
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:49,186
Jonah.

1474
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,355
- Okay.
- Shit.

1475
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:52,940
Craigers, you feeling lucky?

1476
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:54,733
Will history repeat itself?

1477
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:58,529
Thank you.

1478
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:02,825
You got this, dawg.

1479
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:13,085
Seth! No! Not you!

1480
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,260
I'm not going.

1481
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,721
- What?
- I'm not going.

1482
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,097
I'm bowing out. I'm declining to go.

1483
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,308
- What?
- Let me break it down for you.

1484
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:29,268
I'm not fucking going.

1485
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:31,395
You are definitely going.
Tell him he's fucking going.

1486
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:33,772
Tell you what, why don't you
fucking go, Mr. Self-Righteous?

1487
01:10:33,856 --> 01:10:36,275
You're constantly saying what assholes
we are, how good you are.

1488
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:37,902
You go get us some fuckin' water.

1489
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:43,157
I will go.

1490
01:10:44,325 --> 01:10:45,951
Because I have

1491
01:10:46,035 --> 01:10:47,912
-something called honor.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1492
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:49,788
That's good. Yeah, you're very honorable.

1493
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:51,582
I'll go with you, Jay.

1494
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:52,833
Really?

1495
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:55,336
Is it because of our pact upstairs?

1496
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:57,838
Nah, 'cause you got them skinny-ass arms.

1497
01:10:57,922 --> 01:10:59,965
You couldn't carry enough to feed a hamster.

1498
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:02,468
It's working.

1499
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:07,348
Let's get that money.

1500
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:09,016
Let's do it.

1501
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,852
Yo. Out and to the left.

1502
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:20,361
Bye.

1503
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:26,700
Oh, my God.

1504
01:11:26,784 --> 01:11:28,035
What?

1505
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:30,204
That's so sad.

1506
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,540
Innocencelost

1507
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:40,923
What is that?

1508
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:42,174
Fire.

1509
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:43,717
There's, like, fire everywhere.

1510
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:45,094
Damn it!

1511
01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:47,388
Hey, hey!

1512
01:11:49,264 --> 01:11:51,475
Fuck, yeah. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1513
01:12:06,657 --> 01:12:08,409
- Hello?
- Shut the fuck up!

1514
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:10,119
- What?
- You yelling that shit for?

1515
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:11,912
- We got to find out...
- Don't yell no more, man.

1516
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:13,998
Crack you in the head with this frying pan.

1517
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:18,085
Okay. So we should probably split up,
cover more ground.

1518
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:20,421
What you think this is, Scooby-Doo?

1519
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:22,214
We're gonna go in there,
we're gonna find the kitchen,

1520
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,008
and get as much shit as we can, together!

1521
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,259
Then we're getting the fuck out of here.

1522
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:27,094
- All right, all right.
- All right?

1523
01:12:30,806 --> 01:12:31,807
Hey.

1524
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:33,517
Hey.

1525
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,185
What are you doing?

1526
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:39,273
That should be me out there.
I totally fucked those guys.

1527
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:43,777
Fuck was that?

1528
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:47,281
- Oh, fuck!
- Is he okay?

1529
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:48,532
Dude!Jonah!

1530
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,034
What the fuck? What do we do?

1531
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:51,744
- Do you know first aid or anything?
- No.

1532
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:52,911
- Jonah!
- I suck at first aid.

1533
01:12:52,995 --> 01:12:54,288
- Are you okay? Shit!
- Jonah?

1534
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:56,206
Oh, no. Low blood sugar. LBS.

1535
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,125
- LBS!
- He's having an LBS episode!

1536
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,252
<i>- I'll</i> get the Milky Way!
- You get the Milky Way!

1537
01:13:09,178 --> 01:13:10,637
Jay.

1538
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:15,392
Jonah, stay with me! Stay with me.

1539
01:13:15,476 --> 01:13:17,394
I got it, I got it, I got it, got it,
open his mouth.

1540
01:13:17,478 --> 01:13:18,771
- It's your friend, Seth.
- Open his mouth.

1541
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:21,315
Open his mouth. Open his mouth.
I'll get this in there.

1542
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,733
- Okay, okay.
- Shove it right in there.

1543
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,318
Jonah. Milky Way, Jonah.

1544
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:25,903
- You love the Milky Way.
- Yummy, yum.

1545
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:27,321
It's not fucking working, man!

1546
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:29,615
- What the fuck!
- How do we get it in there?

1547
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:32,826
Chew it up, chew it up and spit
in his mouth like a baby bird.

1548
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:36,747
- You just swallowed it, man.
-It's so good.

1549
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,499
Give me a bite.

1550
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:42,377
The second it hits your mouth is,
like, amazing.

1551
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:46,006
- Okay.
- Open it.

1552
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:55,015
What the fuck was that?

1553
01:13:55,099 --> 01:13:57,101
- That's Hebrew.
- That's not Hebrew.

1554
01:13:57,184 --> 01:13:58,560
It's fuckin' Latin or something like that.

1555
01:13:58,644 --> 01:14:00,270
I went to Hebrew school for six years.
That's not Hebrew.

1556
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:03,941
You will drown in a river of blood.

1557
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:05,943
The End of Days is here.

1558
01:14:06,026 --> 01:14:08,946
You will quiver
in the shadow of Kingdom Come.

1559
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:11,949
Judgment Day is upon you.

1560
01:14:12,032 --> 01:14:16,328
The Apocalypse is nigh!

1561
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,833
Hey, I think that's all it could fit.

1562
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:25,587
Man, let's take this back to Franco's,
get the fuck out of here.

1563
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:28,799
What are we going back for?

1564
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:29,967
What are you talking about?

1565
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:34,012
In theory, we could just fuckin' stay here.

1566
01:14:34,096 --> 01:14:39,977
And here, you don't have to sleep
in a friggin' tent under a dick.

1567
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,521
- I like my dick tent.
- I'm just saying,

1568
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:46,400
we could build a life here together, Craig.
I'd be really good to you.

1569
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:51,655
All I know is I'm scared as hell,
and I just want to get back to our friends.

1570
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:52,906
Yeah, but they're not my friends.

1571
01:14:53,407 --> 01:14:54,366
Seth is your friend.

1572
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:56,660
We've been growing apart for years.

1573
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:59,329
That's why I didn't stay
with him last time I was here.

1574
01:14:59,413 --> 01:15:01,832
And I stayed with him
this time to try and salvage it,

1575
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:03,667
but clearly that didn't work out.

1576
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,420
Jay, like it or not,

1577
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:08,755
those assholes are all we got.

1578
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:15,387
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, that was a creak.

1579
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:22,519
What is that?

1580
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:25,939
What is that? Is that bile?

1581
01:15:26,023 --> 01:15:28,066
I don't know. It's cold.

1582
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,401
Sniff it.

1583
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,945
No. You sniff it.

1584
01:15:34,114 --> 01:15:35,949
- What?
- It smells like puke.

1585
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,619
Don't get it on me!

1586
01:15:49,296 --> 01:15:50,589
- It's in my eyes!
- Dude!

1587
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:53,008
-It's in my mouth!
- He's gone!

1588
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:55,260
- Where is he?
- He's fucking gone!

1589
01:15:55,344 --> 01:15:57,596
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

1590
01:16:07,022 --> 01:16:09,650
Please, God! Jesus, Jesus!

1591
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:18,283
Fuck.

1592
01:16:19,034 --> 01:16:20,744
- Jonah!
- Jonah!

1593
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,955
Jonah, stop this!

1594
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:24,581
- Please!
- Jonah, where the fuck are you?

1595
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:26,333
Why did you vomit on us!

1596
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:31,672
Bad Jonah! Stop!

1597
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:33,590
Stop eating him!

1598
01:16:33,674 --> 01:16:35,676
Watch out! He's super strong!

1599
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:39,263
Shit!

1600
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:41,515
What is happen...

1601
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:42,766
Oh, no!

1602
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:44,601
I'm gonna tittie-fuck you, Seth.

1603
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:46,103
Don't tittie-fuck me!

1604
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:47,646
What are they, big B's or small C's?

1605
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:50,274
I'm gonna push your titties together.

1606
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:51,984
Push 'em together!

1607
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:53,652
I'll get you something to help!

1608
01:16:53,735 --> 01:16:55,862
- I'll pass you something!
- Okay, pass it to me.

1609
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,490
Fuck! Shit!

1610
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:05,622
Seth!

1611
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:09,209
We're getting crazy!

1612
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:16,383
Come on! Come on!

1613
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:20,304
Jesus, open, God damn you, open!

1614
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,475
No,no,no,no.

1615
01:17:31,273 --> 01:17:32,733
Jesus“.

1616
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:35,610
Oh, fuck.

1617
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:37,821
- We gotta hide. We gotta hide.
- I know!

1618
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:39,197
- He's coming! He's coming!
- I know he's coming!

1619
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:40,824
I don't know what the fuck to do!

1620
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,659
I don't know...

1621
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:44,411
Where are you going?

1622
01:17:44,786 --> 01:17:46,413
Shit.

1623
01:17:54,963 --> 01:17:56,923
- Please go away.
- He's sniffing.

1624
01:17:57,674 --> 01:17:58,675
I'm so scared, James.

1625
01:17:58,759 --> 01:17:59,926
Be quiet.

1626
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:03,180
- You're breathing really loud.
- Am I?

1627
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:04,723
- Don't breathe through your mouth.
- Okay.

1628
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,936
- Now you're doing loud nose breathing.
- Am I?

1629
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,813
I don't know where else to breathe from.

1630
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,608
- Is that...
- Seth.

1631
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:21,198
Oh, shit. Don't move.

1632
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:22,908
Shit, he's coming right this way. Oh, shit.

1633
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:24,284
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1634
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,794
Get out of my way! Move! Move!

1635
01:18:33,877 --> 01:18:35,837
Fuck!

1636
01:18:38,965 --> 01:18:39,966
You Okay?

1637
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,218
Come on!

1638
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:45,305
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1639
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:49,643
What the fuck! What are you doing?

1640
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:51,144
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1641
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:52,729
There's a fuckin' demon chasing us!

1642
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:54,398
- A demon?
- Demon?

1643
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:57,317
- What the fuck happened to you guys?
- That!

1644
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:58,819
- It's Jonah!
- He's possessed!

1645
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:00,153
He's crazy!

1646
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:03,490
Oh, fuck! You brained him.

1647
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,283
Is that... I was supposed to do that, right?

1648
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:06,493
Yeah.

1649
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,665
Motherfucker.

1650
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:13,917
- Fasten!
- Hurry!

1651
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,461
- Fasten, God damn you, bastard!
- He's gonna be fuckin'

1652
01:19:16,545 --> 01:19:17,921
bad news when he wakes up!

1653
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,840
He's fuckin' strong.

1654
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:21,591
- My side's good.
- Oh, shit!

1655
01:19:21,675 --> 01:19:23,260
All right, I'll fuckin' hit him.

1656
01:19:23,343 --> 01:19:24,928
- Fuck! Come on, come on!
- Okay!

1657
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,811
This shit's cray cray, guys.

1658
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:36,064
I mean, it's, like, the real, like Apocalypse.

1659
01:19:36,148 --> 01:19:40,735
It's, like, the Book of Revelations,
like that means there's a God.

1660
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,112
Right?

1661
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:44,865
I haven't led my life as though there's a God
this whole time.

1662
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:47,451
Who fuckin' saw that coming?
That there's actually a God?

1663
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:50,829
I'd say 95% of the planet.

1664
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,499
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

1665
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:56,626
You might want to stay away
from saying that.

1666
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:59,212
"Jesus fucking Christ"? Why?

1667
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:00,964
- Why can't I say that?
- One of the Ten Commandments.

1668
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:03,884
"Thou shall not take
the name of the Lord thy God in vain."

1669
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,385
Jesus isn't the name of the Lord.

1670
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:06,678
God is name of the Lord.

1671
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:08,805
Jesus, God, it's all the same.

1672
01:20:08,889 --> 01:20:11,183
-It's the Trinity.
- Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

1673
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:13,143
It's like Neapolitan ice cream.

1674
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:14,853
I don't even know what
the fucking Commandments are.

1675
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:19,065
Guys, I think this is sort of bullshit,
because we're all good people.

1676
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:22,319
I can look at each one of you in the eye,
I know you're good.

1677
01:20:22,402 --> 01:20:24,029
- I'm good.
- We're four actors.

1678
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:26,072
We bring joy to people's lives.

1679
01:20:26,156 --> 01:20:27,866
Yeah, but we don't do it for free.

1680
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:32,162
We get paid handsomely,
much higher than the average profession.

1681
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:35,707
It's not like it was just handed to any of us.
We've worked really hard to be here.

1682
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:37,918
Yeah, pretend like it's hot when it's cold.

1683
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,587
You sitting on the beach, it's freezing,

1684
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:44,758
you in your drawers, talking about
something, everybody's surfing.

1685
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:47,052
I think God might have just fucked up,

1686
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:50,180
made a mistake,
and left us behind by accident.

1687
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,224
I mean, He's got a lot of shit on His plate.

1688
01:20:52,307 --> 01:20:55,393
It's not an oversight, it's not a mistake, okay?

1689
01:20:55,477 --> 01:20:59,648
We got to face facts. We're here,
and there's a reason we're all here.

1690
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:02,025
Why are you so sure?

1691
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,194
I've done things, man. I...

1692
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:09,074
I gouged a man's eyeballs out.

1693
01:21:09,157 --> 01:21:10,909
- What the...
- Fuck off.

1694
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,744
- Craig.
- Well, I was a kid, man.

1695
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:15,038
It was a fuckin' bar fight.

1696
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:16,456
It was a bad foosball game.

1697
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:19,209
He said I didn't call spinneys,
and I fuckin' called spinneys.

1698
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:22,128
He got all in my face,
and I smashed a bottle across his face,

1699
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:24,714
and the first eyeball was an accident,

1700
01:21:24,798 --> 01:21:27,425
but then I was, like, fuck it,
and I went for the second one.

1701
01:21:27,509 --> 01:21:29,553
It was fucked up. But you know what?

1702
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:34,099
That shit happens. I'm saying, that's...
I think that's why I'm here.

1703
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:36,226
I got to admit something.

1704
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:37,602
L.-

1705
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:40,897
I fucked Lindsay Lohan.

1706
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:43,858
She was fucked up. She was high.

1707
01:21:43,942 --> 01:21:46,528
It was at the Chateau Marmont,
and she kept banging on my door.

1708
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:49,781
She kept calling me Jake Gyllenhaal.

1709
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:51,157
That's fucked up.

1710
01:21:51,241 --> 01:21:54,744
Yeah, I said, "Call me the Prince of Persia."

1711
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:58,081
See, that's what I'm saying, man.
We've all done bad shit, you know?

1712
01:21:58,164 --> 01:22:01,084
We've done more bad shit
than good in our lives, and

1713
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:06,006
it's time to pay the piper.

1714
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:08,133
Whoa, shit!

1715
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:10,218
Something's wrong.

1716
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:12,429
God did this.

1717
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:16,141
He gave us light, and then He took it away.

1718
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:17,601
You hear that?

1719
01:22:17,684 --> 01:22:19,769
It's the soundtrack of us going insane.

1720
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:22,689
Damn, I wish there was something
we could do to help him.

1721
01:22:23,732 --> 01:22:25,358
I know what we can do.

1722
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,077
The fuckin' stench.

1723
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:50,884
Jonah Hill?

1724
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:53,928
Jonah?

1725
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,516
Jonah Hill.

1726
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,727
Jonah Hill is no more.

1727
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:03,063
Demon?

1728
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,981
Yes?

1729
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:06,983
Fuck. That's not good.

1730
01:23:07,067 --> 01:23:08,360
That's not good.

1731
01:23:09,069 --> 01:23:10,654
Jay, you fool.

1732
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:13,198
I say unto thee,

1733
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,159
the power of Christ compels you!

1734
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:19,079
Does it? Does it compel me?

1735
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:21,206
The power of Christ compels you!

1736
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:24,292
- Does it, Jay?
- The power of Christ compels you!

1737
01:23:24,376 --> 01:23:26,419
Is the power of Christ compelling me?
Is that what's happening?

1738
01:23:26,503 --> 01:23:29,005
The power of Christ compels you!

1739
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:31,508
Guess what? It's not that compelling.

1740
01:23:31,591 --> 01:23:33,760
Jay, you serious right now?

1741
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:36,137
That's your fuckin' plan?
You're gonna repeat lines from The <i>Exorcist?</i>

1742
01:23:36,221 --> 01:23:38,390
I would assume
they did their fuckin' research.

1743
01:23:38,473 --> 01:23:40,350
- It's a movie!
-It's a manual.

1744
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:41,768
It's a fuckin' training manual.

1745
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:45,689
I say unto thee,

1746
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,441
the power of Christ compels you!

1747
01:23:48,525 --> 01:23:50,735
The power of Christ compels you!

1748
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:53,738
The power of Christ compels you!

1749
01:23:53,822 --> 01:23:56,700
Geez, it hurts a little bit.
It's, like, this little sting.

1750
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:59,202
The power of Christ compels you!

1751
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:02,956
- Seriously, fuck off.
- The power of Christ compels you!

1752
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,626
Jay?

1753
01:24:06,835 --> 01:24:09,587
- The power of Christ compels you!
- Holy shit!

1754
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:11,256
- You're pissing him off, man.
- Just stop it!

1755
01:24:11,339 --> 01:24:13,133
- Jay!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1756
01:24:15,635 --> 01:24:17,470
- The power of...
- Get the fuck down!

1757
01:24:17,554 --> 01:24:19,597
- Don't fucking push me, asshole!
- Geez, man!

1758
01:24:19,681 --> 01:24:20,682
- Easy!
'Fuck You!

1759
01:24:20,765 --> 01:24:22,934
- You're a fucking asshole, you liar!
- Still?

1760
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,562
- Yes. Still? Yes.
- Guys, guys, we got a possessed guy here!

1761
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:27,230
Do we have to argue about this right now?

1762
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:29,899
- Let 'em fight.
- We got an exorcism to finish. Hello?

1763
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:31,234
Do you want to know
why I didn't stay with you?

1764
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:32,861
- Yeah.
- You fuckin' changed.

1765
01:24:32,944 --> 01:24:35,822
You're a fuckin' sell-out.

1766
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:38,158
You did fuckin' sell out. Everyone says.

1767
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:42,078
At least I did change! You act like
you're fucking 18 years old still, Jay!

1768
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:44,497
Grow up, Jay. That's why he's yelling at you.

1769
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:46,624
You've been holding me back
this whole time!

1770
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,293
That means fuck you.

1771
01:24:48,376 --> 01:24:50,420
Come on, guys! Come on!

1772
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:53,757
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

1773
01:24:57,135 --> 01:24:58,303
Everybody, out!

1774
01:24:58,386 --> 01:24:59,637
Craig, stop 'em!

1775
01:24:59,721 --> 01:25:01,514
- Get apart!
- Now it's on.

1776
01:25:01,598 --> 01:25:04,017
Yo! What the fuck is all this, Franco?

1777
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:06,936
Looks like food. How'd that get there?

1778
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,397
What? You have more food?

1779
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:10,690
You knew he had extra food?

1780
01:25:10,774 --> 01:25:12,484
Yeah, he gave me one cracker.

1781
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:14,110
I would have sucked a dick for half a cracker.

1782
01:25:14,194 --> 01:25:16,488
All right, well, maybe I didn't want you
to suck my dick, all right?

1783
01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:17,739
- Look...
- I didn't want to suck it!

1784
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:19,449
- That's the point of what I said!
- It was my fucking food!

1785
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:21,659
- Guys, guys, guys, fire!
-Boys, boys, boys...

1786
01:25:21,743 --> 01:25:23,745
- Shit!
- Jonah's on fire!

1787
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:30,877
Put it out!

1788
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,378
Use your mouth! Put it out!

1789
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:42,722
Go, go, go, go, 90!

1790
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,191
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Where is he?

1791
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:54,442
Go, go, go!

1792
01:25:57,028 --> 01:25:58,655
Go, go, go, go, 90!

1793
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:00,490
Go, get outside!

1794
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:03,576
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
- Go, go on!

1795
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,703
Come on, hurry up, he's coming!

1796
01:26:05,787 --> 01:26:07,497
He's coming!

1797
01:26:20,635 --> 01:26:22,262
Watch out, watch out!

1798
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:24,973
Oh, my fortress!

1799
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,726
Boys, I just want to point out,

1800
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:30,270
we're out in the open now.

1801
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,105
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit, shit, shit.

1802
01:26:32,188 --> 01:26:34,357
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1803
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,567
- My Prius.
- Yeah!

1804
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,443
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1805
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:41,698
What is that?

1806
01:26:42,448 --> 01:26:44,450
No fucking way.

1807
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,536
We're screwed!

1808
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:49,080
We're totally screwed, guys.

1809
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:52,917
I got this.

1810
01:26:53,001 --> 01:26:54,544
- What?
- I'll distract the thing.

1811
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:56,588
I'll run over there screaming and shit,

1812
01:26:56,671 --> 01:27:00,300
and that should give you enough time
to get to the garage.

1813
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:02,010
Well, yeah, but that thing can kill you.

1814
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:05,471
Maybe I deserve it.
I've been shitty my whole life.

1815
01:27:05,555 --> 01:27:07,807
Being selfish, only doing shit for me.

1816
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:10,184
Maybe it's only right that the last thing I do

1817
01:27:10,268 --> 01:27:13,354
on this planet isn't for me.

1818
01:27:13,605 --> 01:27:14,856
It's for you guys.

1819
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:16,649
Craig, you don't have to do that.

1820
01:27:16,733 --> 01:27:18,026
Thank you very much, Craig.

1821
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:19,861
- I appreciate that.
- You spineless...

1822
01:27:20,612 --> 01:27:22,530
I love you guys.

1823
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:24,365
You're my best friends.

1824
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:26,451
You're a real mensch, Craig.

1825
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:28,703
See you on the other side.

1826
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:36,336
Hey, hey, asshole! Hey, come on!

1827
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:38,463
Pickle dick, demonic-looking motherfucker.

1828
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:40,673
Nobody's scared of you. You ain't a raccoon!

1829
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:42,550
Yeah, bring your ass, bitch!

1830
01:27:42,634 --> 01:27:45,511
Nobody's scared of you!
I'm Craig fucking Robinson!

1831
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,846
Yeah.

1832
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:48,097
- What's he gonna do?
- Craig.

1833
01:27:48,181 --> 01:27:53,144
I hope you like big dick, motherfucker,
'cause I'm about to fuck you raw!

1834
01:27:53,227 --> 01:27:55,521
For the last goddamn time!

1835
01:27:56,022 --> 01:27:57,649
Take your panties off!

1836
01:28:08,493 --> 01:28:10,119
Fuck,yeah!

1837
01:28:12,497 --> 01:28:13,456
It worked.

1838
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:15,041
What's happening?

1839
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:17,126
Craig! Craig!

1840
01:28:30,098 --> 01:28:33,184
Holy shit, do you guys
realize what this means?

1841
01:28:33,267 --> 01:28:34,811
That Craig was an angel this whole time?

1842
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:37,772
- No, no, it means we can still be saved.
- No, no.

1843
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:42,610
I don't fucking get it,
why does Craig get saved? I mean...

1844
01:28:42,694 --> 01:28:46,948
Craig sacrificed himself for us,
which means that there's still hope.

1845
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:48,825
- That means we can be redeemed.
- Yeah.

1846
01:28:48,908 --> 01:28:50,660
It means that if we're
actually nice to each other,

1847
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:53,538
we can get sucked up into Heaven, too.
That's the deal.

1848
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:55,331
All right, I got it, let's just head out

1849
01:28:55,415 --> 01:28:57,667
-to my place in Malibu.
- Yeah.

1850
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,920
Just survive long enough
until we do enough good things

1851
01:29:01,004 --> 01:29:03,047
and they accumulate
or do enough sacrifices,

1852
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:04,257
and we'll all go to Heaven together.

1853
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:06,300
That's a great idea, James.

1854
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:08,052
Seriously, really, really good idea.

1855
01:29:08,136 --> 01:29:09,971
Really, you're such a smart guy.

1856
01:29:10,054 --> 01:29:12,098
Thanks, Seth, you're such a nice guy.

1857
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:13,391
You got a great smile.

1858
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:15,184
- Thanks, man.
- And an awesome laugh.

1859
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:17,270
- I've heard it's annoying.
- How about that Jay back there, man?

1860
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:18,938
- Dude, Jay, you kidding me? Come on.
- Come on.

1861
01:29:19,022 --> 01:29:20,314
- One of a kind.
- Get out of here.

1862
01:29:20,398 --> 01:29:23,151
You got a cool body. You can walk around
with your shirt off anytime.

1863
01:29:23,234 --> 01:29:24,861
It's not working, this isn't working.

1864
01:29:24,944 --> 01:29:26,779
What, you thought we would be
Raptured already?

1865
01:29:26,863 --> 01:29:27,905
I thought it would happen already.

1866
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:29,115
No, we've just been talking nice.

1867
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:31,075
Talking nice doesn't get you into Heaven.

1868
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:33,286
Doesn't hurt to smile...

1869
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:36,914
What the fuck?

1870
01:29:36,998 --> 01:29:38,332
You guys Okay?

1871
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,126
- Oh, shit.
- Christ.

1872
01:29:50,344 --> 01:29:51,804
- Franco!
- Come on!

1873
01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:56,350
Yo, cut his fucking head off!

1874
01:29:56,434 --> 01:29:58,853
What's going on?

1875
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:00,897
No!

1876
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:02,190
"StOpl
- No!

1877
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:22,168
- Danny?
- What the fuck?

1878
01:30:22,251 --> 01:30:24,545
- You guys are still alive?
- Yeah.

1879
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:26,714
Holy shit, I didn't expect that.

1880
01:30:26,798 --> 01:30:28,716
Fuck out here.

1881
01:30:29,634 --> 01:30:30,718
Get...

1882
01:30:30,802 --> 01:30:32,553
- Shit, I can't believe you guys are here.
- Oh, Jesus.

1883
01:30:32,637 --> 01:30:36,390
That's fucking crazy,
and your timing couldn't be more perfect.

1884
01:30:36,766 --> 01:30:39,352
It's been a long time
since any of us have eaten,

1885
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:42,230
and you three gentlemen look delicious.

1886
01:30:42,313 --> 01:30:45,358
- What does that have to do with us?
- The fuck are you talking about?

1887
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:47,110
I'm a cannibal, hombre.

1888
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:48,986
We're gonna fucking eat your ass.

1889
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,655
Fuck you, you can't eat us. Fuck that, man.

1890
01:30:50,738 --> 01:30:53,574
I do whatever the fuck I want, when I want.

1891
01:30:53,658 --> 01:30:55,243
I butt-fucked this dude.

1892
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:57,411
See that?

1893
01:30:57,495 --> 01:30:59,080
I fucking slide right in that shit.

1894
01:30:59,163 --> 01:31:01,916
I do whatever I want. This is my gimp.

1895
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:03,543
Channing, introduce yourself.

1896
01:31:03,835 --> 01:31:04,919
Hey, what's up, guys?

1897
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:06,420
Y'all cool?

1898
01:31:06,504 --> 01:31:07,922
That's Channing Tatum.

1899
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,757
That's Channing Tatum, dude.
What the fuck?

1900
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:11,968
Channing fucking Tatum.
I found him wandering on the freeway.

1901
01:31:12,051 --> 01:31:14,720
I collected him, made him my bitch.
Get off my dick.

1902
01:31:14,804 --> 01:31:17,640
I call him Channing Tate-yum.

1903
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:19,976
- Hard-core, man.
- I got him trained good.

1904
01:31:20,059 --> 01:31:21,686
Watch, he does tricks. Wait, shake hands.

1905
01:31:21,769 --> 01:31:24,272
- All right, Seth.
- Fucking roll over.

1906
01:31:24,355 --> 01:31:25,857
- I'm gonna create a diversion.
- Yeah.

1907
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:27,817
- You and Jay make a run for it.
- What?

1908
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,443
Danny's gonna eat you.

1909
01:31:29,527 --> 01:31:32,530
Listen, full-on sacrifice for you, dawg,

1910
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:34,615
-like the ending to <i>Pineapple</i> 2.
- Yeah, lick that.

1911
01:31:34,699 --> 01:31:37,869
- That's Channing fucking Tatum, dawg.
- I love him.

1912
01:31:37,952 --> 01:31:40,413
That's fucking G.l. Joe, dude.
Fucking loves me.

1913
01:31:41,247 --> 01:31:43,749
Danny! We're friends! You can't eat us!

1914
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:48,379
I'd love to catch up,
but we're fucking starving, so let's eat!

1915
01:31:48,462 --> 01:31:49,547
FUCK you!

1916
01:31:51,299 --> 01:31:52,717
Run!

1917
01:31:54,969 --> 01:31:56,012
Eat this!

1918
01:31:56,846 --> 01:31:59,515
Shit, fuck! Get him!

1919
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:03,352
- Who wants it, you piece of shit?
- Man, we should go back.

1920
01:32:03,436 --> 01:32:04,812
- We should go back and help him.
- We should go back.

1921
01:32:08,649 --> 01:32:09,692
Fucking Rapture.

1922
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:11,777
- Holy shit!
- It worked!

1923
01:32:16,324 --> 01:32:17,742
What the fuck?

1924
01:32:17,825 --> 01:32:20,161
Go to hell, McBride!

1925
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:21,829
FUCK you!

1926
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:25,750
Suck my dick!

1927
01:32:30,213 --> 01:32:31,839
- Oh, shit.
- What happened?

1928
01:32:31,923 --> 01:32:34,091
What did I do? Take me back!

1929
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:36,260
- What did I do?
- I'll tell you what happened, Franco.

1930
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:41,807
You don't get to get sucked up into Heaven
'cause you were being petty. Tom Petty.

1931
01:32:41,891 --> 01:32:43,809
You may not have invited me to your party,

1932
01:32:44,602 --> 01:32:47,313
-but you're the guest of honor at mine.
- What?

1933
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:52,151
How fucking crazy is this?

1934
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,990
Seth, Jay!

1935
01:32:58,074 --> 01:32:59,700
Oh, shit, they're running after us.

1936
01:32:59,784 --> 01:33:02,495
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Run.

1937
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:04,038
Bring them to me!

1938
01:33:04,121 --> 01:33:06,499
- Fuck.
- Get 'em!

1939
01:33:06,999 --> 01:33:08,834
Got to get Rogen.

1940
01:33:10,169 --> 01:33:11,170
Over here.

1941
01:33:11,254 --> 01:33:13,005
- What? Over here, over here.
- Here. What?

1942
01:33:13,089 --> 01:33:15,841
Shit, shit.

1943
01:33:16,509 --> 01:33:18,386
They're around here somewhere.

1944
01:33:18,469 --> 01:33:20,304
They kept running, you fucking idiots.

1945
01:33:20,805 --> 01:33:22,390
Shit, are they still there?

1946
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:23,975
- I think they're gone.
- Are they gone?

1947
01:33:24,058 --> 01:33:25,977
- Oh, my God.
- Why did Franco flip off Danny?

1948
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,645
Why did he have to do that, man?

1949
01:33:27,728 --> 01:33:30,356
- He was in the clear.
- That is textbook.

1950
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:31,941
Vanity or...

1951
01:33:32,024 --> 01:33:33,276
- Is it vanity?
- Vanity or envy.

1952
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:34,735
Is it envy or wrath?

1953
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:36,821
- It's any of them, man.
- You can't do that.

1954
01:33:36,904 --> 01:33:38,489
It's being a sore winner, is what it is,

1955
01:33:38,572 --> 01:33:39,865
-more than anything.
- That's exactly what it is.

1956
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:40,950
- You can't be a sore winner.
- No.

1957
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:45,538
Well, this is another fine mess
we found ourselves in.

1958
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:50,084
Fuck.

1959
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:51,711
Listen, Jay...

1960
01:33:52,253 --> 01:33:53,671
Oh, shit.

1961
01:33:55,756 --> 01:33:57,925
Get out of here, let's get out of here.

1962
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:05,391
You've got to be fucking shitting me!

1963
01:34:05,558 --> 01:34:07,393
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

1964
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:09,186
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

1965
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:11,689
- That thing's big.
- Holy shit.

1966
01:34:11,772 --> 01:34:13,024
It's so big.

1967
01:34:13,107 --> 01:34:16,986
Oh, man. Oh, Jesus.

1968
01:34:25,202 --> 01:34:26,329
- We're gonna die, man.
- Okay.

1969
01:34:26,412 --> 01:34:27,496
Okay, we're gonna die.

1970
01:34:33,002 --> 01:34:34,920
- Jesus!
- Oh, no!

1971
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:41,761
- Shit.
- Listen to me, man.

1972
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:44,555
I'm a fucking idiot. I put myself up.

1973
01:34:44,638 --> 01:34:46,015
I'm self-righteous.

1974
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:47,558
- I think I'm better than you.
- No, no.

1975
01:34:47,641 --> 01:34:48,851
I was resistant to change.

1976
01:34:48,934 --> 01:34:50,895
- No.
- I should have grown with you.

1977
01:34:50,978 --> 01:34:54,315
I should have changed with you.
We should have changed together.

1978
01:34:54,398 --> 01:34:57,777
I didn't like what I became
so I hated what you became.

1979
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:59,653
It's fine, man. It's fine.

1980
01:34:59,737 --> 01:35:01,572
- I love you, Seth, fucking love you, buddy.
- I love you, man.

1981
01:35:01,655 --> 01:35:03,074
- I always loved you.
- Let's die together, man.

1982
01:35:03,157 --> 01:35:04,992
- Let's die together.
- I love you, Jay.

1983
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:18,339
- Holy shit, Jay, all right!
- Yeah, we did it!

1984
01:35:18,422 --> 01:35:19,799
I'm not getting sucked up into Heaven!

1985
01:35:19,882 --> 01:35:21,092
What do you mean? Why not?

1986
01:35:21,175 --> 01:35:22,760
I don't know why not!

1987
01:35:22,843 --> 01:35:23,928
Take my hand!

1988
01:35:24,011 --> 01:35:25,221
Okay, take me with you, Jay!

1989
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:26,889
I'll take you with me.

1990
01:35:28,557 --> 01:35:30,142
Yeah!

1991
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:35,689
- Yeah!
-It's working!

1992
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:36,982
Yeah!

1993
01:35:44,365 --> 01:35:46,909
Oh, no! He sees us!

1994
01:35:48,953 --> 01:35:51,247
He can't touch us!

1995
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,915
We're in a force field!

1996
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:59,672
Oh, shit! Shit!

1997
01:36:03,467 --> 01:36:05,094
It's not gonna take me with you!

1998
01:36:05,177 --> 01:36:06,262
We're going down!

1999
01:36:06,345 --> 01:36:09,265
Keep holding on
and you'll get pulled up, too!

2000
01:36:09,348 --> 01:36:11,267
It's not! No, I won't, man!

2001
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:13,060
I don't deserve to.

2002
01:36:13,686 --> 01:36:14,895
Fuck.

2003
01:36:18,607 --> 01:36:19,817
I'm gonna let go, Jay.

2004
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,026
You'll die!

2005
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:23,571
I know, but you won't.

2006
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:24,864
No!

2007
01:36:24,947 --> 01:36:27,867
I don't deserve to go to Heaven, but you do.

2008
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:29,368
You do, okay?

2009
01:36:29,452 --> 01:36:31,328
We're both gonna die if I don't let go.

2010
01:36:32,913 --> 01:36:35,249
I'm not gonna hold you back anymore.

2011
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:39,003
No!

2012
01:37:12,328 --> 01:37:14,413
Yeah!

2013
01:37:14,914 --> 01:37:17,374
Come, hold my hand, buddy!

2014
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:19,460
Hold my hand!

2015
01:37:19,543 --> 01:37:21,420
- Yeah!
- You did it!

2016
01:37:21,504 --> 01:37:23,088
- You did it!
- Yeah!

2017
01:37:23,172 --> 01:37:24,381
You did it!

2018
01:37:24,465 --> 01:37:26,800
Yeah!

2019
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:32,431
We're flying!

2020
01:37:57,831 --> 01:37:58,874
- Look!
- What?

2021
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:00,626
Wow.

2022
01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:07,508
Welcome to Heaven, motherfuckers.

2023
01:38:08,342 --> 01:38:10,010
Craig!

2024
01:38:11,637 --> 01:38:13,472
- Yay!
- Yeah !

2025
01:38:13,973 --> 01:38:15,432
- Craig.
- Oh, my...

2026
01:38:15,516 --> 01:38:17,685
- What?
- This is awesome.

2027
01:38:17,768 --> 01:38:19,436
- Are you an angel?
- Yes, sir.

2028
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,021
- That's so cool, man.
- That is so cool.

2029
01:38:21,105 --> 01:38:22,690
Congratulations, dude.

2030
01:38:23,023 --> 01:38:24,024
Fellas.

2031
01:38:24,108 --> 01:38:25,859
- Yeah.
- Yes.

2032
01:38:26,235 --> 01:38:27,695
Dude, you got one.

2033
01:38:27,778 --> 01:38:28,821
- What?
- That's so cool.

2034
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:29,989
- Do I have one?
- Do I have one?

2035
01:38:30,072 --> 01:38:31,240
- I can't see it.
- Do I have...

2036
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:32,825
- Wait.
- Let's touch 'em.

2037
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:35,327
- Dude, this is so...
- Wow.

2038
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:36,996
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

2039
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:38,330
Come this way.

2040
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:51,552
Right? Do you love it? Do you love it?

2041
01:38:52,219 --> 01:38:54,555
Whoa, they got weed in Heaven?

2042
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:56,432
- What?
- You tell me.

2043
01:38:57,016 --> 01:38:58,058
What?

2044
01:38:58,142 --> 01:39:01,103
Holy shit! That's awesome!

2045
01:39:03,731 --> 01:39:04,898
Wow.

2046
01:39:04,982 --> 01:39:06,483
That's insane, man.

2047
01:39:06,567 --> 01:39:07,901
No,no,no,no,no,no.

2048
01:39:07,985 --> 01:39:10,613
That's Heaven.
Anything you could think of is yours.

2049
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:13,991
Whoa!

2050
01:39:14,074 --> 01:39:16,785
Holy shit, this is awesome.

2051
01:39:16,869 --> 01:39:17,911
Segway!

2052
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,663
I've always wanted to ride
one of these things.

2053
01:39:19,747 --> 01:39:21,957
Go ahead, Jay, make a wish.

2054
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:23,083
Anything you could think of.

2055
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:25,044
Anything?

2056
01:39:33,385 --> 01:39:34,386
What?

2057
01:39:35,638 --> 01:39:37,640
No fucking way.
