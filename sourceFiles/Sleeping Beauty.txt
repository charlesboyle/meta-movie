1
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,585
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,840
- Your autograph, please.
- Sure.

3
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,014
Thank you.

4
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,207
Thanks for this.

5
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,980
Good. That's it.

6
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,362
Good.

7
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:56,342
I'm pushing the air in now,
just a little.

8
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,387
So the pressure in the chest
will change.

9
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,632
Do you need a ride, Lucy?

10
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,592
No, thanks.

11
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,843
Think I might do the dry cleaners.

12
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,016
See you.

13
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,126
Can I interest you in a line?

14
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,338
Yeah, why not?

15
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,052
Thanks.

16
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,388
My pleasure.

17
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,520
- This is Lucy.
- Hi.

18
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,647
Hi, Lucy.

19
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,692
Lucy in the sky.

20
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,987
We were just talking about which
one of us is gonna fuck you.

21
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,114
Really?

22
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,287
Why don't you toss for it then?

23
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,627
You in?

24
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,672
Heads or tails?

25
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,926
Head.

26
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,141
Cunt.

27
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,185
Head it is.

28
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,396
Yes, my prince. Did I say when?

29
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,358
Did I say tonight?

30
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,528
This year, next year.

31
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,657
Fair enough. We'll toss.

32
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,825
Tonight or next year.

33
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,911
Tonight...

34
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,996
head.

35
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,293
- Tonight.
- It's my lucky night.

36
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,381
Now, or in 5 hours?

37
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,426
OK, now.

38
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,555
Tails.

39
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,853
Tails never fails.

40
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,276
Let's go then, shall we?

41
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,408
Bye.

42
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,173
- Morning.
- Morning.

43
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,471
Have you got the rent?

44
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,476
The rent?

45
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,688
The rent.

46
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:06,903
As in the rent. The rent
is due, the rent is overdue.

47
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,157
Here's some. Won't kill them to wait.

48
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,326
You have no idea, do you?
It's her house.

49
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,372
Is it your house?

50
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,544
It's her parent's house. It's no
virtue on being born.

51
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,713
Just pay the fucking rent.

52
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,758
And while you're at it,
clean the fucking bathroom.

53
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,009
As we all agreed, it's your turn.

54
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,970
- I did clean the bathroom.
- You have to grout.

55
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,265
Grout.

56
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,353
In between the tiles,
the black stuff.

57
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,566
It will give me
great pleasure to grout.

58
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,511
Lucy.

59
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,980
Telephone. It's your mother.

60
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,114
- Line 3.
- Thank you.

61
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,456
Hi, mom.

62
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,750
How did you get this number?

63
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,795
No.

64
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,926
Do you want me to lose this job?

65
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,225
OK, yes. I've got it in my hand.

66
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,560
It's VISA.

67
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,563
5464...

68
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,692
6870...

69
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,946
1390.

70
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,951
The expiry is 04/15.

71
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,374
Sorry?

72
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,628
Yeah, I can see it. It's 399.

73
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,885
I have to go now, mom.

74
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,973
I have to go. OK, bye.

75
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,041
- Hello, Lucy.
- Hello, Birdman.

76
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,128
- Come in.
- I bare gifts.

77
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,849
Thanks.

78
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,063
- So, how are you?
- I'm very well, thank you. And you?

79
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,983
Oh yes, very well. Thank you.

80
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,320
- How's the family?
- Very well, thank you. And yours?

81
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,363
- Oh yes, very well.
- And how are the kids?

82
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,491
Yes, they're fantastic.

83
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,578
That's great.

84
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,876
It's good to see you.

85
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,047
You look beautiful.

86
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,090
Thank you.

87
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,859
I have something important to tell you.

88
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,158
Do you remember that time...
on the beach.

89
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,370
After we'd been to Andy's place,
that moment.

90
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,583
I wanted to kiss you.

91
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,588
You must have wanted me to kiss you.

92
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,968
I couldn't because of my tongue.

93
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,014
My tongue was furred.

94
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,142
Furred and thick.

95
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,312
Putrid.

96
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,482
The asshole, of the asshole,
of the asshole.

97
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,740
I couldn't kiss you.

98
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,995
That's OK.

99
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,249
I wanted you to know.

100
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,379
I just want to love my friends.

101
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,596
I know.

102
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,851
It's not an unreasonable request.

103
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,317
I'm so fucking tired...

104
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,279
of watching Oprah.

105
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,943
Hi. I'm Melissa. I'm calling about the ad
in the student paper.

106
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,242
Slim.

107
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,412
Pert.

108
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,711
What should I wear?

109
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,883
OK great. I look forward to seeing you.

110
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,094
Good bye.

111
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,532
Are you sure you don't want
a cup of tea or coffee?

112
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,953
- Water?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

113
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,297
Yes, I think we're ready.

114
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,467
Yes.

115
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,024
- Hello.
- Hi.

116
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,109
Please, come in.

117
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,238
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

118
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,368
Thank you for coming.

119
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,580
Such a pleasure to see
such a unique beauty.

120
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,835
Let me tell you how things
should proceed.

121
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,921
I'll describe the job and then
if you're interested...

122
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,090
we'll discuss particulars,
how does that sound?

123
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,051
Yes. Good.

124
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,180
We're looking for Silver service waitress
to work at private functions...

125
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,349
in lingerie that we will supply.

126
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,434
You will be working with
other girls...

127
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,521
some of whom will have
more responsibilities.

128
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,732
There is room for promotion.

129
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,902
The pay is $250 on hour cash.

130
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,072
You'll be engaged on a freelance basis.

131
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,075
Job by job.

132
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,161
Either one of us can terminate our
arrangement at any time...

133
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,456
so please be sure to maintain another
more reliable source of income.

134
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,418
I understand.

135
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,798
We rely on mutual trust.
And discretion.

136
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,886
And I'm obliged to tell you they're
heavy penalties...

137
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,974
very heavy penalties
for any breaches of discretion.

138
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,355
- Am I clear?
- Yes.

139
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:32,528
My sincere advice to you is to
use the money wisely.

140
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,825
Think of it as a windfall,
pay off a student loan.

141
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,037
Please, please do not think
of this as a career.

142
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,249
Just work hard for a short
amount of time.

143
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,420
Your vagina will not be penetrated.

144
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,592
- Your vagina will be a temple.
- My vagina...

145
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,596
is not a temple.

146
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,768
While that's quite true my darling, you won?
Ever be penetrated.

147
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,981
Now. Will you stand up
for me please and strip.

148
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,618
Thomas?

149
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,215
Open your mouth, darling.

150
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,726
Not pierced?

151
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,817
Do you have any tattoos?

152
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,987
Good.

153
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,156
Stand your feet apart a few inches.

154
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,435
What's this?

155
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,355
I had a mole removed.

156
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,652
Please, get dressed.

157
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:41,949
I have some questions that
I need to ask you.

158
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,119
Are you on any medication?

159
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,205
Just the pill.

160
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,291
Anything else?

161
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,419
- No allergies? Antidepressants?
- No.

162
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,464
- Prozac? Effexor?
- No.

163
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,716
Are you a smoker?

164
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,760
No.

165
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,804
Maybe the occasional...

166
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,934
jazz cigarette. Very rarely.

167
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,063
Other drugs? Anything at all toxic?

168
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,149
No, never.

169
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,442
Why not?

170
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:21,405
Throughout history humankind has used drugs.
Drugs are a form of...

171
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,658
grace.

172
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,744
Aspirin for the soul.

173
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,790
My mother is an alcoholic
with a violent temper.

174
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,918
She runs an astrology hot-line.

175
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,553
We have a doctor that we'd
like you to see. For blood tests.

176
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,515
- Will that be a problem?
- No, that's fine.

177
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,685
You called us on a public telephone.
You have mobile?

178
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,854
- Yes.
- Good.

179
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,940
We'll cover all your expenses,
all your work-related expenses.

180
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,150
Now.

181
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,153
Silver service.

182
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,199
- Are you familiar with Silver service?
- Yes.

183
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,537
From what side does one serve the fish?

184
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,707
- Right side.
- Left side.

185
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,753
Thomas, take note.
Thomas is going to help you.

186
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,967
You are very beautiful.
Very talented.

187
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,261
But we're going to make you
even more beautiful.

188
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,389
Even more talented. Come.

189
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,520
And your name...

190
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,607
We'd like to call you Sara.

191
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,737
OK. Thank you.

192
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,468
Fuck!

193
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,597
- You all right, darling?
- Yeah.

194
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,980
- Would you like a lavender tissue?
- Sure.

195
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,364
I'm sorry.

196
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,492
Fuck.

197
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,004
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

198
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,133
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you. And how are you?

199
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,135
Oh yes, fine. Thank you.

200
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,304
OK sit down at the table.

201
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,307
To what do I owe this
extraordinary pleasure?

202
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,517
Nothing special.

203
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,646
Just upgrading my skill set.

204
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,859
Nothing special?

205
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,115
White or white?

206
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,883
Can we watch some porn?

207
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,094
No.

208
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,396
What have you done
to your fingers?

209
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,808
Sara?

210
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,389
Hi, Sara. I'm Sophie.

211
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,685
- You look lovely.
- Thanks.

212
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:47,982
OK. Now, I need you to go into the
dressing room for me and fix your make up.

213
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,985
You'll find a lipstick palette in there
and I want you to match...

214
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,154
an exact match...

215
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,370
You're kidding me.

216
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,745
It's not a game.

217
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:47,203
You're OK? Good.

218
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,414
Ready?

219
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,459
Let's go.

220
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,253
Thank you friends for coming
here tonight.

221
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,506
As ever, it is wonderful to see you.

222
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,766
This evening we're serving
Beluga caviar with toasted brioche.

223
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,921
Service.

224
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:30,389
Galantine of quail stuffed with black truffle
on the nest of fried leek and herbs.

225
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:32,600
Curious choice.

226
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,812
I first tried that dish
many years ago.

227
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:40,816
On the occasion of my 20th
wedding anniversary.

228
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,028
But tonight, I've asked my chef
to do what he can...

229
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,155
to bring it back to life.

230
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:51,202
Perhaps you'll be able to tell me
whether it really does taste so good.

231
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:56,666
Or if it is the memories of Elizabeth
and that night that make it so special.

232
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,752
To the dish itself.

233
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:03,840
To the dish.

234
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,051
To memories.

235
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,504
- Brandy?
- Thank you.

236
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:50,845
Such fair skin.

237
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:53,890
Brandy?

238
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:12,700
Thank you.

239
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,557
Not to worry.

240
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,644
Upsy daisy.

241
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:42,980
No harm done.

242
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:56,410
Sorry...

243
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,704
Don't worry.
You did really well.

244
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,005
Leave those for the cleaners.

245
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,134
We won't be needing you
any more tonight.

246
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,223
Thanks.

247
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,420
- You look lovely.
- Yeah, you too.

248
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:36,547
Your hair looks great.

249
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:46,974
Can I leave early tonight?

250
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,061
- Just this once.
- Thank you.

251
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,129
It gets a bit easier.

252
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,215
It's never easy, though.

253
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,386
How long have you been
doing it for?

254
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,723
What kind of a question
is that?

255
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:33,813
I'm sorry.

256
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:54,625
- Thanks.
- No problem.

257
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:33,206
May 1?

258
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,416
Yeah, be my guest.

259
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:45,635
Some people fake their deaths.
I'm faking my life.

260
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,931
You're doing a good job.

261
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,228
I want to show you something.

262
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,955
I would really love to
suck your cock.

263
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:21,254
Hallelujah.

264
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:54,453
Hi, Lucy.

265
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:57,748
What time is it?

266
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:15,349
Can I get you anything?

267
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:17,435
Coffee?

268
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:20,479
Yeah, coffee. Thanks.

269
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:29,030
Hey, Birdman?

270
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,033
Will you marry me?

271
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:35,203
Yes.

272
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,289
Thank you.

273
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:41,417
- Not at all.
- It's very kind of you.

274
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:44,754
It's a pleasure.

275
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,142
Thanks.

276
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:11,864
I'm ready, I think.

277
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:16,994
I think I'm nearly ready.

278
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:30,466
We can get you back into detox.

279
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,636
I could, I'm flush.

280
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:36,848
Thank you.

281
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,061
I don't think I'd make it
this time.

282
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,235
You could.

283
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,408
Do you believe that?

284
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,707
I don't know.

285
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,644
Sandhill Dunnart.

286
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,856
Nocturnal and endangered.

287
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,817
A marsupial mouse.

288
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:32,987
Thought to be extinct
until recently.

289
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:36,115
Its main predators include
owls and bats.

290
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:40,453
Little is known about the animal
due to its rarity.

291
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:45,625
First they eat insects but
will also eat meat on occasion.

292
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:48,753
Sharp, carnivore's teeth.

293
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:52,924
Scared, Sandhill Dunnart will make
a loud noise...

294
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:56,010
as it moves into an
offensive position.

295
00:43:59,263 --> 00:44:01,182
What it really is...

296
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:04,393
the Sandhill Dunnart...

297
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:09,649
is a miniature, a more
tenacious kangaroo.

298
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:26,165
Hi, Thomas. No time, no hear.

299
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:30,419
I'd be happy to do what I can,
try me.

300
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:34,590
Sorry?

301
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,763
For how long?

302
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:45,059
That's it?

303
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:49,230
How much?

304
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:56,529
OK yes. Yeah, I understand.

305
00:44:57,488 --> 00:44:58,531
OK. Bye.

306
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,513
- Hey.
- Good afternoon.

307
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:22,466
Come in. Come through.

308
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:24,552
Welcome to my home.

309
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:26,721
I hope the trip wasn't too grueling.

310
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,765
- No, it was fine. Thank you.
- Wonderful.

311
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:33,853
Perhaps you'd like a shower
to refresh you after your long drive.

312
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:37,023
There's a bathroom at the end
of the corridor on the right.

313
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:39,066
You'll find a robe behind the door.

314
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:44,280
Oh, and try not to let your
hair get wet.

315
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:45,406
Sure.

316
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:02,006
I'm ready.

317
00:48:05,134 --> 00:48:07,303
- Are you feeling well?
- Pardon?

318
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:10,473
Are you in good health?

319
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:12,642
Yeah, I'm fine.

320
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:04,610
You're going to sleep
and wake up.

321
00:49:04,777 --> 00:49:06,821
It'd be as if these hours
never existed.

322
00:49:07,864 --> 00:49:09,824
You won't even dream.

323
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:14,078
For an hour or two after you wake
you'll feel, yes, slightly...

324
00:49:14,954 --> 00:49:16,163
groggy, but then fine.

325
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:19,166
Perfectly fine.

326
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,335
Not nearly as bad as a hangover.

327
00:49:22,378 --> 00:49:24,422
Such a sleep works wonders.

328
00:49:25,506 --> 00:49:26,549
You'll feel...

329
00:49:28,551 --> 00:49:29,719
profoundly restored.

330
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:25,942
Thank you, Clara.

331
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:34,325
A few months ago,
a strange thing happened.

332
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,413
I was idling through my bookshelves,
when I noticed a book...

333
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:42,583
my brother's once given me
for my birthday.

334
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:44,710
A collection of short stories.

335
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:49,924
Well, I started to reread
one of those stories.

336
00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:55,221
It was about a man who one morning
wakes up and cannot...

337
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:58,182
bring himself to get out of bed.

338
00:50:58,307 --> 00:51:01,561
He shuts his eyes is self defense.

339
00:51:03,604 --> 00:51:07,650
He reexamines his life.
He's seized with a restlessness.

340
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:12,989
He packs his bags, cuts all ties, he can
no longer live among the people he knows.

341
00:51:13,906 --> 00:51:15,950
They paralyze him.

342
00:51:16,075 --> 00:51:19,120
He's monied, he goes to Rome.

343
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:24,250
He wants to burrow under the earth
like a bulb, like a root.

344
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:28,671
But even in Rome he cannot escape
people from his former life.

345
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:33,843
So, he decides to return to the city
where he was born and educated...

346
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:38,890
but which he can't quite
bring himself to call home.

347
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:43,269
Well, the move doesn't help.

348
00:51:45,146 --> 00:51:48,399
He feels he has no more right
to return than a dead man.

349
00:51:49,442 --> 00:51:53,654
What can he do? He desires an extreme
solution to his conundrum.

350
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:58,826
He aches for nothing less than
a new world, a new language.

351
00:52:00,953 --> 00:52:02,997
Nothing changes.

352
00:52:04,123 --> 00:52:08,127
Out of indifference, and because he
can't think of anything better to do...

353
00:52:09,212 --> 00:52:13,299
he decides once more to
leave his hometown, to do some hitching.

354
00:52:13,382 --> 00:52:17,512
A man picks him up, they ride off into the
night when BANG, the car smacks into a wall.

355
00:52:17,637 --> 00:52:21,766
The driver dies, our man
is hospitalized, broken up.

356
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:29,065
Months pass, his wounds heal.

357
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:34,153
Now he wishes for life.

358
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:39,367
He has a confidence in himself,
in things he doesn't have to explain.

359
00:52:39,534 --> 00:52:44,747
Things like the pores in his skin,
all things corporeal.

360
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:50,002
He can't wait to get out of the hospital,
away from the infirm and the moribund.

361
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:58,135
"I say unto thee, rise up and walk.
None of your bones are broken".

362
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:01,305
The end.

363
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:07,520
When I reread those words "Rise up and walk.
None of your bones are broken"...

364
00:53:08,771 --> 00:53:10,857
I felt a tremendous sadness.

365
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:14,986
Do you know what the opening
line of the story is?

366
00:53:16,988 --> 00:53:23,202
"When a man enters his 30th year
people will not stop calling him young".

367
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:26,330
30.

368
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:29,542
I'd been given the book
for my thirtieth birthday.

369
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:33,588
"The Thirtieth Year"
by Ingeborg Bachman.

370
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:37,717
So I had heard.

371
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:40,011
I had been told.

372
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:45,183
I knew all along, even if
I didn't really know.

373
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:51,314
The great true things are unsurprising.

374
00:53:53,524 --> 00:53:56,569
But what did I do back then?

375
00:53:57,778 --> 00:54:00,781
I carried on.

376
00:54:02,783 --> 00:54:05,870
I carried on dutifully

377
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:10,291
We were the happy couple, Elizabeth and I.
That's how people saw us.

378
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,463
But in truth, I did not cherish my wife.

379
00:54:17,548 --> 00:54:19,634
And I did not cherish my friends.

380
00:54:22,678 --> 00:54:24,805
Or even my children.

381
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:32,104
I just carried on.

382
00:54:37,276 --> 00:54:38,444
I made my way.

383
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:44,617
But with each step I cringed.
I was on the back foot, the defensive.

384
00:54:47,703 --> 00:54:49,664
And now...

385
00:54:51,874 --> 00:54:56,128
tonight, for the first time
I say...

386
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:00,174
my bones are broken.

387
00:55:02,176 --> 00:55:03,427
Broken.

388
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:09,642
One day I will need your help.

389
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:18,985
All of my bones are broken.

390
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:28,244
You're safe.

391
00:55:30,538 --> 00:55:34,750
There's no shame here.
No one can see you.

392
00:55:37,795 --> 00:55:40,882
But our rules must be respected.
No penetration.

393
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:43,885
Thank you, Clara.

394
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:04,901
Take care.

395
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,862
You will feel better very soon.

396
00:58:08,946 --> 00:58:10,072
Thanks.

397
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:24,545
Your instinct was right.

398
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:27,673
We'll see.

399
00:59:14,554 --> 00:59:15,721
You really are a fuckwit.

400
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:19,976
2 weeks and you're out.

401
00:59:21,894 --> 00:59:23,062
Adios amigo.

402
00:59:23,855 --> 00:59:25,106
Chinga tu madre.
(Fuck your mother)

403
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,280
I'm really sorry.

404
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:36,409
Me too.

405
01:00:02,602 --> 01:00:03,769
Good morning.

406
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,331
Is this Excel on still available?

407
01:00:24,373 --> 01:00:28,544
That's right. Fantastic place.
Out of the city.

408
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:30,796
I have keys, I can show you
if you like.

409
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:33,799
No, it's fine.

410
01:00:33,966 --> 01:00:37,011
I'm sure the Excel on
will be excellent.

411
01:00:41,265 --> 01:00:44,352
- It is better to see it, though.
- No, it's OK.

412
01:00:47,438 --> 01:00:49,398
I have a friend in the building.

413
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:53,694
Well, if that's the case,
then we can definitely do that.

414
01:00:54,737 --> 01:00:55,821
Do you have photo ID?

415
01:00:57,823 --> 01:00:59,867
Some paperwork.
You know how it is.

416
01:01:00,034 --> 01:01:02,119
A stitch in time saves nine.

417
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:43,179
Hi, Thomas. This is Sara.

418
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:45,389
I was just wondering if
Clara is out of her meeting.

419
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,521
Maybe you could give me a hand.

420
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:55,650
Thing is, I have a new lease.

421
01:02:56,609 --> 01:02:58,778
I was just wondering if there's
any work available.

422
01:03:04,116 --> 01:03:07,078
I'd be really grateful if you
could keep me in mind.

423
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:10,248
Thanks very much. Bye, Thomas.

424
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,484
Nearly done.

425
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:57,336
It's OK.

426
01:04:14,812 --> 01:04:16,063
Here it comes, it's all right.

427
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:20,067
Sorry.

428
01:04:21,068 --> 01:04:22,320
I have an important call,
I really have to take it.

429
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:25,323
I'll be back, Dr. Frankenstein.

430
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:28,576
OK. Bad monster.

431
01:04:30,536 --> 01:04:31,579
Look.

432
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,707
It's my bag. I'm coming back, OK?

433
01:04:58,689 --> 01:05:00,858
We have one rule.
No penetration.

434
01:05:03,986 --> 01:05:09,242
Only way I can get a hard on these days
is if I swallow a truckload of Viagra...

435
01:05:10,076 --> 01:05:13,412
and then some beautiful woman
jams her fingers up my ass.

436
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:21,671
I'm the one that needs
the penetration.

437
01:05:21,754 --> 01:05:23,798
I don't expect that
good fortune tonight.

438
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,925
You're quite right.

439
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:29,887
Thanks, Clara.

440
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:25,878
Stretch your cunt, you little bitch.

441
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:50,296
I'm gonna press your button
and make you all wet.

442
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:55,426
Then I'm gonna fuck you
with my big dick.

443
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:03,809
I'm gonna fuck you with my
horse's prick and make you fucking scream.

444
01:09:26,749 --> 01:09:28,960
You fucking little bitch.

445
01:09:39,345 --> 01:09:42,306
You fucking little whore.

446
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:23,139
You fucking little bitch.

447
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:24,617
Hi.

448
01:11:27,662 --> 01:11:29,747
OK, I'm coming.

449
01:11:37,046 --> 01:11:39,090
Excuse me.

450
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:16,711
It's OK, I'm here.

451
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:19,714
Hello, Lucy.

452
01:12:25,094 --> 01:12:27,221
Take your top off.

453
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:57,205
I love drinking.
I'm really good at it.

454
01:14:59,248 --> 01:15:00,374
When did you last see him?

455
01:15:03,544 --> 01:15:06,547
About 3 or 4 months ago.
Took him out to dinner.

456
01:15:07,632 --> 01:15:09,759
He was wearing your old suit,
I think. The gray one.

457
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,973
I haven't seen the Birdman in...

458
01:15:18,017 --> 01:15:20,061
Well, when was the last time
I saw you?

459
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:23,272
A Year?

460
01:15:26,526 --> 01:15:29,487
They say it was 2 weeks before
his brother found him.

461
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:33,658
2 weeks in this weather.

462
01:15:36,786 --> 01:15:38,871
Will you marry me?

463
01:15:40,122 --> 01:15:42,041
What?

464
01:15:44,126 --> 01:15:45,336
Why?

465
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:48,339
I mean

466
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:50,508
Why now?

467
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:53,553
You had your chance.

468
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:55,680
Go on.

469
01:16:00,768 --> 01:16:01,853
Fuck you.

470
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:06,065
Fuck you to death.

471
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,152
That's one way to put it.

472
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:15,408
I'm with Helen now.

473
01:16:20,746 --> 01:16:22,623
I can't believe you.

474
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:25,918
I don't believe you.

475
01:16:27,003 --> 01:16:28,880
You don't believe you.

476
01:16:30,006 --> 01:16:31,132
Fuck it.

477
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:39,473
Helen is courteous.

478
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:43,603
You should try it sometime.

479
01:16:46,606 --> 01:16:47,773
Courtesy.

480
01:16:50,818 --> 01:16:52,028
Courtesy.

481
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:11,797
You'll be safe here.

482
01:17:12,757 --> 01:17:15,801
There's no shame.
No one can see you.

483
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:17,970
Thank you, Clara.

484
01:17:18,137 --> 01:17:21,098
I do ask that there?
Will be no penetration.

485
01:17:22,183 --> 01:17:25,228
I also ask that you take care
not to leave any marks.

486
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:27,396
Thank you.

487
01:19:38,694 --> 01:19:40,780
We do fire people here, you know?

488
01:19:43,866 --> 01:19:45,117
Well?

489
01:19:48,204 --> 01:19:50,164
All right, you're fired.

490
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,335
Thank you.

491
01:20:17,358 --> 01:20:18,359
Excuse me?

492
01:20:19,443 --> 01:20:21,404
Hello, excuse me?

493
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,698
Hi. Can I get some help?

494
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:27,827
What do you think of this one?

495
01:20:29,787 --> 01:20:30,997
Yeah, not bad.

496
01:20:32,081 --> 01:20:34,000
OK, I'll take it then.

497
01:20:35,168 --> 01:20:37,086
Cool. Up here.

498
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,642
OK. Let's get going.

499
01:20:54,812 --> 01:20:59,066
We pick up with black 129,
making a bold move to attack his triangle.

500
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:03,112
It's an impressive move,
unexpected.

501
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:07,325
And then, what does the
master do?

502
01:21:08,367 --> 01:21:11,579
He counter attacks, with white
130 to the right.

503
01:21:12,705 --> 01:21:15,708
White 130? Why did he do that?

504
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:19,003
After 27 long minutes of deliberation...

505
01:21:20,004 --> 01:21:24,217
why did the master play a move,
that would result in his own defeat?

506
01:22:52,722 --> 01:22:53,723
Are you gonna come to the party?

507
01:22:53,848 --> 01:22:55,892
I can't. Have a big day tomorrow

508
01:22:55,892 --> 01:22:58,019
- How big?
- I'm sleeping.

509
01:22:58,895 --> 01:23:02,064
What?
Live a little. Just a little.

510
01:23:04,192 --> 01:23:06,194
- What is it?
- I don't know.

511
01:23:08,446 --> 01:23:10,531
But it's something good for you.

512
01:23:12,533 --> 01:23:13,701
Why not?

513
01:23:18,789 --> 01:23:20,958
There you go.
Back from the dead.

514
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:24,086
Fear of death is the number 1 hoax.

515
01:24:30,862 --> 01:24:32,822
Lucy, turn it off.

516
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:47,503
Hello?

517
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:53,676
Yeah. In 2 minutes. OK.

518
01:24:57,805 --> 01:25:01,976
You need to get some blinds.
Fucking hell.

519
01:25:40,556 --> 01:25:41,641
Lucy.

520
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:44,685
Come back inside.

521
01:25:46,812 --> 01:25:47,980
- You're sure?
- She's fine.

522
01:26:32,859 --> 01:26:34,694
Can you pull over?

523
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:36,946
Pull over!

524
01:27:28,039 --> 01:27:29,123
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

525
01:27:32,126 --> 01:27:34,253
- Are you well?
- Fine, thank you.

526
01:27:36,339 --> 01:27:39,383
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

527
01:27:41,594 --> 01:27:43,679
A shower always works wonders.

528
01:28:16,045 --> 01:28:18,005
I'd like to ask a favor.

529
01:28:26,347 --> 01:28:29,517
I need to see what goes on in there.
Just once.

530
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:36,691
I understand. Believe me, I do.

531
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:39,861
But my clients...

532
01:28:41,028 --> 01:28:46,117
How can I expose them,
to be frank, to blackmail?

533
01:28:47,201 --> 01:28:48,286
Just once.

534
01:28:49,328 --> 01:28:51,372
That's not the way that
we do things.

535
01:28:53,457 --> 01:28:55,543
- Please, Clara.
- I'm sorry.

536
01:29:09,098 --> 01:29:10,308
And I can assume you're quite well?

537
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:14,353
Perfectly fine, thank you.

538
01:29:15,521 --> 01:29:17,481
And you're in good health?

539
01:29:18,649 --> 01:29:20,526
