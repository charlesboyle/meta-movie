you sent here, Colonel.

We'd have to
reroute to Mezzouna,
join the 21st Panzer.

At least then
we'd have a chance.

And the records will show
that we didn't have enough
water to reach Sidi Mansour?

00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,042
How are you going to
deal with Goebbels?
Himmler? The SS?

174
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,045
They will wipe you out!
It doesn't matter!

175
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,009
It only matters
that we act, now,
before we lose the war.

176
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,305
Otherwise,
this will always be
Hitler's Germany.

177
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,145
And we have to show
the world that not all
of us were like him.

178
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,814
That is not enough for me.

179
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,693
There has to be
a chance of success.

180
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,863

I'd come see you
in Bamberg.

STAUFFENBERG: Valkyrie.

195
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,419
We've already
considered Valkyrie.
It isn't suitable.

196
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,629
Not as it's currently written,
but the Colonel has an idea

197
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,922
I think we should consider.

198
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,257
Excuse me.
What is Valkyrie?

199
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,925
BECK: Operation Valkyrie.

200
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,303
The Reserve Army
has thousands of men
all over Berlin.

201
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,931
Valkyrie is Hitler's
contingency plan

202
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,559
to mobilize those men
during a national emergency.

203
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,061
The sole purpose of
the order is to protect
Hitler's government

204
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,521
if he's cut off
or killed.

205
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,273
And what use
is this to us?

206
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:06,026
Valkyrie is designed
to contain civil unrest.

207
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,863
But what if the SS
were staging a coup?

208
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,911
State Security is trying
to overthrow Hitler.

209
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,164
How would High
Command respond?
We would have no choice.

210
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,957
We would declare
a military state
of emergency.

211
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,750
Exactly,
and initiate Valkyrie.

212
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,712
Hitler's own Reserve Army,
using Hitler's own plan,

213
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,425
will have no choice
but to seize power in Berlin
to prevent the SS takeover.

214
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,180
They'll think
they're fighting for Hitler's
government, not against it.

That's what you're
saying, isn't it?

218
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,401
How else are you going
to convince people the SS
are trying to seize power?

219
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,361
We have to kill Hitler.

220
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm disappointed
in you, Colonel.

221
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,781
I thought a man
of your background

222
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,826
would suggest a more
honorable approach.

223
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,538
OLBRICHT: Your plan has a few
minor obstacles, Colonel.

224
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,000
Firstly, Valkyrie
would have to be rewritten
to exclude the SS.

225
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,836
Then I'll need
your help to get a copy.

226
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,089
Rewriting an order
is one thing.

227
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,843
Distributing it is another.

228
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,220
In this case,

229
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,848
we'd be willfully
circulating written
evidence of high treason.

230
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,601
Evidence requiring
Hitler's signature.

231
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,193
Well, we can all draw
straws for that job.

232
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,111
And what about Fromm?

233
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,363
Fromm? Who is Fromm?

234
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,073
He's the commander
of the Reserve Army.

235
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,866
I can put
the reserve troops
on alert,

236
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,452
but only Fromm
can initiate Valkyrie.

237
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,874
Can you get to him?

238
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,297
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

239
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,590
He's a careerist pig.

240
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,260
But one who's gone
as far as he can go
in Hitler's army.

241
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,387
It's no secret
he's not happy
about it.

242
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,390
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

243
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,059
Make him see the light.

244
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,528

is through there.

00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,585

you'd surrender

253
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,045

will see you now.

What is it you want?

256
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,365
I wanted to
introduce our new man,
Colonel Stauffenberg.

257
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,369
Ah! From Africa.

258
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,832
I... I'd offer you my hand,
but I might not get it back.

259
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,463
I'd say the General
has lost more important
things this morning.

260
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,889
It's about time
they put somebody with
balls into this office.

261
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,724
Please, sit down, Colonel.

262
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,643

if you must.

you're critical of
the war, Colonel,

00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,619
not that you don't seem
to have good reason.

266
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,663
I am critical
of indecision,
General.

267
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,748
In the field?
In Berlin.

268
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,170
So that's why
you're here,
I take it, to...

269
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,421
To make decisions.

270
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,256
I've already
made my decision.

271
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,926
I'm here to help
others make theirs.

They say when there's
no clear option,

273
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,811
the best thing
is to do nothing.

274
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:12,106
We're at war.
We must act.

275
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,108
Sometimes rashly.

276
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,613
And what rash action
did you have in mind,
Colonel?

277
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,953
That would be a decision
for the supreme military
commander, sir.

278
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,539
A supreme commander.

279
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,877
Second only to
the Chancellor.

280
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,260
If I were that man,

281
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,515
this war would be
going quite differently.

282
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,601
Well, we were thinking
the same thing.

283
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,238
I don't need to remind you

284
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,659
that we've all sworn an oath

285
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,747
to the Führer.

286
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,591
Having said that,
I'm going to forget this
conversation ever took place,

287
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,092
in the strict understanding

288
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,012
that such talk
never occurs again
under this roof.

289
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,722
Is that clear?
BOTH: Yes, sir.

290
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,599
Now, you can tell
your friends, Colonel,

291
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,268
that I always come down
on the right side.

292
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:36,148
And as long as
the Führer is alive,
you know what side that is.

293
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,741
Heil Hitler.

294
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,868
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.

(SINGING IN GERMAN)

296
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,736
Of course! Yes!
Very good guess!

297
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,471
You realize how close
I am to Hitler.

298
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,266
With one word
I can make
you disappear.

299
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,018
My associates don't know
we've been talking,

300

if that's what
you're afraid of.

301
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,187
When the SS catch you,

302
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,607
they will pull you apart
like warm bread.

303
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,652
It will be a crime
just to have
known you then.

304
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,197
I warn you, don't try
to contact me again.

305
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,782
You won't report me.

306
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,368
Maybe if you had
when I first
approached you,

307
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,830
you might have been
keeping your oath.

308
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,373
Now you're just as
guilty as the rest of us.

309
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,792
And you think
that makes me
a sympathizer, hey?

310
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,503
Give a man a choice of
betraying his fellow
officer or his Führer

311
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,089
and you think his actions
will show you his heart.

312
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,092
It is not that simple.
Yes. Yes, it is.

313
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,888
For the last time,
don't push me to
make a decision.

314
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,640
I don't have a choice.
It's clear now.

315
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,437
Without you,
there is no hope
of success.

316
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,523
You're nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship!

317
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,942
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

318
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,570
What makes you think
you're stronger than
the people, the Reich?

319
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,238
The very momentum
of history!

320
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,573
This is going to happen.

321
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:53,118
Action is inevitable,
as are the consequences.

322
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,703
When they come for me,
I'll do everything I can

323
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,371
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it,

324
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,165
but don't delude yourself.

325
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,292
You were involved
in a crime
against your country

326
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,294
long before you met me.

327
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,382
There may still be time
to redeem yourself.

328
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,013
Only God can
judge us now.

329
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,939
STAUFFENBERG: Hitler had
Operation Valkyrie designed

330
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,775
to completely secure
his government
in six hours.

331
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:29,488
I'm rewriting the order
so we can seize control
of the government in three.

332
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,239
As written,
the order spreads
reserve troops

333
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,742
across all of Germany's
19 military districts,

334
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,871
including occupied cities
like Paris, Vienna
and Prague.

335
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,665
This is a waste
of resources.

336
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:43,627
Since all of these districts
follow orders from Berlin
without question,

337
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,129
you take Berlin,
you take Germany.

338
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,132
I'm rewriting Valkyrie

339
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,842
to direct the majority
of our strongest units

340
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,095
to focus
entirely on Berlin.

341
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,722
We'll surround
the government quarter,

342
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,891
occupy all SS
and police barracks.

343
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,601
Once we have control
of the government,

344
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,396
we'll shut down
all concentration camps.

345
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,148
Any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot.

346
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,734
I've been transferred
to the front.

347
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,572
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

348
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,492
You know these orders
better than anyone.

349
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,162
That's why I'm putting you
in charge of the military
wing of the operation.

350
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,372
Beck agrees.

351
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,540
Why not Olbricht?

352
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,710
No. It's your plan. It's you.

353
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,921
One more thing.
You need to be
absolutely certain

354
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,007
no conflicting orders
get out after the flash.

355
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,592
It is not enough
to kill Hitler.

356
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,428
We need to isolate
his chain of command

357
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,055
and cut them off
from the outside
world immediately.

358
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,017
Yes, I've already
considered that.

359
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,893
I think I have just
the man who can help.

360
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,812
Who is he?

361
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,314
Perhaps it's better
I don't say.

362
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,238
You know,
God promised Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom

363
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,700
if he could find
just 10 righteous men.

364
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,537
I have a feeling that,
for Germany,
it may come down to one.

365
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,462
Let's begin.

366
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,257
"The Führer, Adolf Hitler,

367
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,595
"is dead."

368
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,479
Heil Hitler, General.

369
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,943
Would you excuse us,
please? Thank you.

370
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,245
You play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully.

371
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,914
It's the only time
I get to relax.

372
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:47,542
You've been promoted
Chief of Staff
for the Reserve Army.

373
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,754
Excuse me?
Congratulations.

374
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,967
I am busy
with other things.
Unfortunately,

375
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,596
your nocturnal activities
don't count as service
to the Reich.

376
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,806
I'll refuse the promotion.

377
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,016
You'll do no such thing.

378
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,685
Tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation,

379
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,604
but in this world
I still outrank you.

380
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,107
You will accept
the promotion.

381
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,150
You'll have real
access to Hitler,

382
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,362
his advisers,
his schedule.
We need this.

383
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,034
I've looked through
your changes to Valkyrie.

384
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,161
I approve.

385
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,830
I'll need you to get
Hitler to sign it.

386
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,712
Now. There's a man here
to interview as your adjutant.

387
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,965
He comes highly recommended.

388
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,306
Close the door.

389
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,020
Be seated.

390
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,819
Do you know how this war
will end, Lieutenant?

391
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,780
The portrait
will be unhung,

392
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,075
and the man will be hung.

393
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,794
I'm engaged in high treason
with all means available
to me.

394
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,629
Can I count you in?

395
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,098

Anything at all.

Colonel Stauffenberg,
I'd like to review your
presentation to the Führer.

of the Colonel's bag

are for the Führer's
eyes only.

I am the Führer's eyes,
Lieutenant.

404
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,225
The Colonel is
a member of my staff
at the War Ministry.

405
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,352
He doesn't answer to you.

406
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,816
They're waiting.
This way.

May I present
Colonel Stauffenberg,

410
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,150
our new chief of staff
for the Reserve Army.

411
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,569
Heil, my Führer.

412
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,452
May I say
what an honor it is
to meet an officer

413
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:55,248
who has sacrificed
so much for Germany.

414
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,215
If only more of my men
were like you.

415
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,219
Let this man stand
as an example
to all of you.

416
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,097
He is the ideal
German officer.

417
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,354
My Führer.
Colonel Stauffenberg was
asked to come here today

418
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,483
to brief us on
mobilizing troops of
the Reserve Army to...

419
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,443
To repel the invasion.

420
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,363
HITLER: Invasion?

421
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,450
At Normandy, my Führer.

422
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,745
Oh, yes.

423
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,748
Normandy.

424
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,043
That will not
be necessary.

425
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:46,174
Reichsmarschall G鰎ing
assures me that everything
is completely under control.

426
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,720
Thank you, Colonel.

427
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,893
My Führer, if I may.

428
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,939
I have an amended copy
of Operation Valkyrie
for your approval.

429
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,534
You know
your Wagner,
Colonel?

430
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:05,378
The Valkyrie.
Handmaidens of the Gods,

431
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:10,550
choosing who will live
and who will die,
sparing the most heroic

432
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,387
from an agonizing death.

00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,729

National Socialism

434
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,108
if one does not
understand Wagner.

435
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,128
I'm sure whatever
changes you've made
are for the best.

You're dismissed.
Send your man home.

444
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,721
with the careful application
of high explosives.

445
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,183
The trick is
not to be around
when they go off.

446
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,228
Two 975-gram
packs of Plastit W.

447
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,730
Enough explosive
to cripple a panzer.

448
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,484
Your detonators,
your fuses.
British time pencils.

449
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,613
This acid capsule
is your trigger.
When you're ready to arm,

450
00:42:55,698 --> 00:43:00,577
attach the detonator
to the bottom of
the time pencil, like so,

451
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,497
insert the entire device into
either end of the Plastit W,

452
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,668
crush the acid capsule,
and you're live.

453
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:14,924
When the acid
eats through the wire
holding back the firing pin,

454
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,677
well, you'll want
to be very far away.

455
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,181
For you.

456
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,975
How much time
will we have?

457
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,768
Theoretically
there's a 30-minute delay,

458
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,271
but with the kind of heat
you can expect
at the Wolf's Lair,

459
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,523
I'd give you
10, 15 minutes, tops.

460
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,483
That's hardly precise.

461
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,029
This is state-of-the-art.
You can have small
or precise, not both.

462
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,281
Might this just be
a little too small?

463
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,743
No. Hitler's bunker
will magnify the blast.

464
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,788
It is constructed of
reinforced concrete.
Steel door, no windows.

465
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,208
The air pressure generated by
just one of these explosives
in a space like that

466
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,044
will kill everyone
instantly.

467
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,379
The second charge
will be entirely redundant.

468
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,300
Lf, by some miracle,
Hitler does survive,
what then?

469
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,719
We still initiate Valkyrie.

470
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,138
At that point,
there will be
no turning back.

471
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,390
But we'll have
an advantage.

472
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,144
We have an inside man
at the Wolf's Lair.

473
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:11,105
After the flash,
he'll cut off communication
with the outside world.

474
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,483
While Hitler's inner circle
is struggling to regroup,

475
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:17,278
we'll have
the momentum we need to
seize control in Berlin.

476
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,573
Himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well.

477
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,493
Don't proceed unless
you can get them both.

478
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,078
What?

479
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:29,707
Don't proceed unless
you're confident you can get
both Himmler and Hitler.

00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,091
This is Goerdeler, isn't it?

481
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,847
I'll hold off,
if the decision
is unanimous,

482
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,893
but I want another man
on the committee.
Not a politician.

00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,270
Who?
Him.

STAUFFENBERG: Him.

485
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,275
Fine.

486
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,822
But remember,
this is a military operation.

487
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,450
Nothing ever goes
according to plan.

488
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,441
I'll take the children
to Bamberg.

489
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,824
If I fail,

490
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,329
they'll come for you.

00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,458
All of you.

492
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,546

BECK: Gentlemen.
Good morning.

494
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:31,287
Hitler has scheduled
a military briefing
for today at 1:00.

495
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,873
Stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present.

496
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,709
They're here.
BECK: Before arming
the explosives,

497
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,670
Stauffenberg will call
for authorization to proceed.

498
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,964
After the flash,
his inside man

499
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,634
will sever all communications.

500
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,220
Assuming Fromm
refuses to join us,

501
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,472
Olbricht would take command
of the Reserve Army

502
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,474
and initiate Valkyrie.
Initiate Valkyrie.

503
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,226
Then he'll notify
all district commanders

504
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,895
that the SS is attempting
to seize power.

505
00:46:55,979 --> 00:47:00,399
The Reserve Army
will arrest all SS, Gestapo
and Nazi officials.

506
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,652
By then, Stauffenberg
will have returned to Berlin

507
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,154
and taken command
of the Reserve Army.

508
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,908
Witzleben and I will assume
the roles of commander of

01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:30,355
but they're coming down
on the northern and
the southern fronts as well.

679
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:35,360
As you can see, my Führer,
if the enemy continues
at this rate,

680
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,863
the situation in
the East Prussian
sector is critical.

681
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:43,201
Lack of supplies
is continuing to weaken
our main units,

682
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,286
and reserves are
severely depleted.

683
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,373
My Führer, you remember
Colonel Stauffenberg?

684
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,924
HEUSINGER:
As you are all aware,

685
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,886
in the past two days alone,
the 10th Army
has given up Ancona,

686
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,973
the 14th Division
has been pushed out
of Livorno.

687
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:08,810
Army Group Center
has already lost 28
of their 40 divisions.

688
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,730
That is a total of
almost 350,000 men.

689
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:21,865
Since the Red Army
first attacked
nearly a month ago,

690
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:25,243
our troops have
already been pushed back
to the Polish border.

691

693
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,833
This,
compounded with the loss
of the 4th Army in Minsk,

694
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,878
threatens the entire
eastern perimeter.
Yes, sir.

695
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:38,339
We must consider
pulling men from
Army Group North Ukraine,

696
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,924
as well as the Romanian...

697
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,724
...and prevent
further losses.

698
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:50,810
Unless we can
quickly dispatch
new blocking divisions

699
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,938
at vital points
along the German right,

700
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,356

There's a telephone
call for you.

702
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,526
...by the enemy in
less than a fortnight.

703
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,405
And we run the risk
of losing all the ground
we have managed to gain

704
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:06,326
in the last three years.
Our spearhead...

705
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,454
General Fellgiebel, sir.
He says it's urgent.

706
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:15,376
Yes, General,
this is Stauffenberg.

707
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:23,092
...Russian air activity
has proven just as impregnable
as their ground force.

708
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,303
(SHOUTING) Why?
HEUSINGER: My Führer...

709
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:35,438
In some areas
they outnumber us
seven to one.

710
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:38,274
If we can afford
to give ground

711
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,777
along the Italian
front, I further...

712
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,032
One thing is certain,

713
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:49,869
the Red Army will continue
an aggressive push west,

714
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:50,995
even at the expense...

715
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,502

rebuild at this...

716

and closing on
Army Group at Lake Peipus.

718
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:13,726

immediately withdrawn,
it will be a catastrophe.

with an urgent message
for General Olbricht.

732

(STUTTERS)
I couldn't be sure.

Well, get him
back on the line.

738
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:06,339
Sir, the bomb did go off.
That much was clear.

739
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:09,467
Fellgiebel's next step will be
to sever all communications.

740

Sorry, Colonel.
No one gets in or out.

741

We have an order
from the Führer.

742
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,566
We have to get to
the airfield immediately.
Open the gate.

743
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,402
I'm very sorry,
but my orders are
to keep the gate...

744
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,320
I just gave you
an order, Sergeant.

745
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,322
Sir!

746
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,574
Sir. Excuse me.

747
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,252
Colonel Stauffenberg
for Field Marshal Keitel.

748
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,051
Colonel Stauffenberg
was explicit.

749
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,719
We initiate
Valkyrie regardless.

750
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,430
Only Fromm can initiate.
You know that.

751
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,597
Then tell him
Hitler's dead.

752
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,391
Or arrest him.
But do it now.

753
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:02,311
Sir, you have to give the
order to initiate Valkyrie.
This is our only...

754
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,480
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from Fellgiebel.

755
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,815
Get him back
on the phone now.

756
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:08,276
Every second
we stand here arguing
is a second lost.

757
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,777
The risk is too great.

758
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,780
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

759
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,199
He did his part,
and now you're
abandoning him.

...Kolbe won't let me
pass the main gate.

765
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,587
Yes, sir, I explained that.

766
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:30,423
Perhaps you can make
him understand, sir.

767
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:38,389
Everything's fine now, sir.
Thank you.

768
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,227
Open the gate!

769
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,654
At least put
the Reserve Army
on alert.

770
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,323
When Stauffenberg returns,

771
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:59,660

then we'll proceed.

01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:19,053
You did.

847
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:29,271
This is treason.

848
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:32,191
Right now, the Reserve Army's
assuming control of Berlin.

849
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:34,026
Are you with us or not?

850
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,695
Do you realize
what you've done?

851
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,822
The Führer is alive.
I delivered the bomb myself.

852
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,075
I saw the blast.
He is dead.

853
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:44,912
Are you with us?

854
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:46,413
(STAMMERS)
I don't believe
this is happening.

855
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:49,792
This is some kind of a joke.
Are you with us or not?

856
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:52,461
Colonel, if what
you say is true,

857
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,172
you should shoot
yourself immediately.

858
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,590
The rest of you
are under arrest.

859
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:58,383
No, General. You are.

860
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:07,267
I don't know where
you think this is going.

861
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,939
Get me Operations.

862
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,566
This is Colonel Stauffenberg.

863
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,111
Seal off the War Ministry
per Operation Valkyrie.

864
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,237
No one gets in or out

865
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:20,781
without authorization
from General Olbricht's
office.

866
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:40,509
General Beck.

867
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:42,970
You're not wearing
your uniform, sir.

868
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:46,140
This should be seen
as a movement of the people.

869

(DOOR OPENS)

870
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:55,149
Colonel Stauffenberg?
Yes.

871
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,740
The chief has guaranteed
the full support of
the Berlin Police.

872
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:09,454
You will have no
interference from my men.
You have my word.

873
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,209
Thank you.

874
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:53,415
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

875
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,881
Thank you for coming.

876
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,264
Gentlemen, in three hours
I want confirmation

877
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,183
that the government
quarter is ours

878
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:14,645
and SS Command
has been cleared
of every living soul.

879
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,564
You all know
what must be done.

880
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:20,943
By nightfall, I want to know
that Hitler's Germany

881
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:22,778
has seen its last sunrise.

882
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,283
(HORN HONKING)

883
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:56,478
STAUFFENBERG: Yes, sir.
All replacements
have been authorized.

884
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:57,980
In fact,
Field Marshal Witzleben

885
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:00,023
has been appointed
Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces.

886
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:02,484
That's exactly why
he's been appointed.

887
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:03,694
If he was a member
of the Party,

888
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:05,112
he'd be locked up
as a suspect.

889
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:07,364
Yes, sir,
I understand your concern,
but this is an emergency.

890
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,157
The commanding officer
at the 11 th District, please.

891
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,284
I need a decision, Major.

892
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,160
Tell your men
that acts of vengeance
will not be tolerated.

893
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,371
STAUFFENBERG: Why hasn't
anyone occupied the Tegel
broadcasting station?

894
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,039
Can I speak to
the commanding officer
in Hannover, please?

895
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,291
BECK: We represent
a different form
of government.

896
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,792
STAUFFENBERG:
I'd be careful
who you said that to.

897
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:20,460
Loyalty to the Party
isn't what it used to be.

898
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:21,878
Yes, Paris. France.

899
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,338
Not since they
murdered the Führer.

900
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:24,965
And, Josef. Thank you.

901
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:26,383
You've made
the right decision.

902
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:29,553
District 13 is ours.

903
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,608
By order of
Field Marshal
von Witzleben,

904
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:46,903
you are under arrest
for crimes against the state.

905
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:57,998
This is Stauffenberg.
I'm trying to connect
with Major-General Thadden.

906
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:59,499
No, I've already spoken
to 413 Battalion.

907
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,209
You'll have no trouble
getting reinforcements.

908
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:03,170
The order
explaining everything
will be in your hand shortly.

909
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,922
No, these are your orders.
Excellent.

910
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:10,510
My wife is in Bamberg
with my children.

911
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,012
Would you please
try to raise them
on the phone?

912
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,139
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

913
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:16,099
General Schwedler
has issued
the Valkyrie orders

914
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,225
and has sealed off
headquarters.

915
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,186
Good. Check on
the radio stations
every 20 minutes

916
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,480
till we
have confirmation
they're ours.

917
01:29:33,993 --> 01:29:35,202
STAUFFENBERG: Well,
with all due respect, sir,

918
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:36,578
you can't believe
everything you hear.

919
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:38,497
That is SS propaganda.
He's dead.

920
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:42,626
Only the commander
of the Home Army is
authorized to give orders.

921
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,878

BECK: Hello, Christian?
Our men in
the transport offices

923
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,341
have secured the railway
communications network,

924
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:50,425
but there are
repeater stations...

Yes. I give you my word.
...telephone and

to your family.

STAUFFENBERG:
Mertz? Call Potsdam.

930
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,355
Tell them to place
all available units
under our control.

931
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,232
You have your men.
Now get control
of the radio.

932
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:07,234
We have control
of the government quarter.

933
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:09,319
We don't have Berlin yet.

Arrest orders, sir.

01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,389
One from
Colonel Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry

937
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:40,100
to arrest Reich
Minister Goebbels.

938
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:42,102
The other is from
the Wolf's Lair,

939
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,187
to arrest
Colonel Stauffenberg.

940
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,903
Send them both through.

941
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,198
Our job is not to
interpret orders,

942
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:57,951
our job is to pass
them along, regardless.

01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:00,745

be all, Sergeant.

You're all going
to pay for this!

01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:25,061
Do you hear me?

947
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:39,826
New arrest orders, sir.

948
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,578
For Stauffenberg
and Goebbels.

949
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:45,165
Do we arrest them both?

950
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,710
I would hate to
find out I'm being
taken advantage of.

951
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:50,545
You really think
it's a coup?

952
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,089
Of that I am certain.

which side we're on.

seeing that this
gets done.

I've just spoken
to Colonel Linstow.

960

They've arrested
1,200 SS and Gestapo
officials in Paris.

Not a single shot fired.

01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:15,880
What can I do
for you, Major?

968
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:19,092
My battalion
has an order to blockade
the government quarter

969
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:21,303
and place you
under arrest.

Yes, my Führer.

975

Then listen to me
very carefully.

976

I want these traitors
taken alive.

977
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,350
Yes, my Führer.

978
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:14,856
You heard what he said.

979
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,317
The Führer wants
the traitors taken alive.

980
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:20,737
Yes, sir.

981
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:50,684
It's a coup, all right.
We can't afford to remain
neutral any longer.

982
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,107
You have to make
a decision.

983
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:02,195
When it's over,
we better wind up
on the right side.

984
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:10,120
Very well.

985
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:14,874
Send through
all communications
from the Wolf's Lair.

986
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,752

from Stauffenberg.

988
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:29,180
But they're part
of the coup.

989
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:31,725
I've just been
on the phone
with Hitler himself.

990
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,226
We are the coup,
you idiot.

991
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:34,978
We've been duped.

992
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:40,483
We've lost contact
with District 11.

993
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,739
The switchboard
is overloaded.

994
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:47,824
Give it 10 minutes
and try again.

995
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,039
Give me General Bieler,
District 11.

996
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:56,499
We still need...

997
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,293
I don't want to
leave any section...
Keep trying.

998
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:02,130
Out of my way.
Where is General Fromm?

999
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:08,678
General Fromm is no longer
in command. I am.

1000
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,389
Beck?
What are you doing here?
What is going on?

1001
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:12,974
The Führer is dead.

1002
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:14,601
The SS are staging a coup.

1003
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:17,312
We've initiated
Operation Valkyrie
to crush the uprising

1004
01:36:17,396 --> 01:36:18,938
and save Hitler's Germany.

1005
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:22,317
You will present the order
to your troops.

1006
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:25,570
I will do no such thing until
I speak to General Fromm.

1007
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:29,032
You will follow your orders,
or you are under arrest.

1008
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:36,080
This is treason.
I will take no part.
The Führer is not dead.

1009
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,958
The Führer is not dead!
Stop him!

1010
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:42,545
The Führer is not dead!
The Führer is not dead!

1011
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:46,049
I have sworn an oath!
This is treason!

1012
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:49,302
You all swore an oath!
Listen to what I have to say.

1013
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:52,931
You are all making
a terrible mistake!

1014
01:36:53,766 --> 01:37:00,230
The Führer is not dead!

Please try
my wife again.

1016

Bamberg, please.

1017
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,169
Take your hands off me!

1018
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:30,218
HAEFTEN: Sir.

Over 215 enemy tanks
have been annihilated

STAUFFENBERG: Lieutenant.

1023
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:52,490
I can't get through
to General Gerlach.

1024
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:55,785
Send a runner
down to his office.
Bring him here.

1025
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:00,331
BECK: Yes, thank you.

1026
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,792
Yes, this is Stauffenberg.

1027
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,295
I was speaking to the General
about five minutes ago.

1028
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:06,671
He told me
he'd return my call.

1029
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:08,172
I've yet to
hear from him.

1030
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:10,758
I trust everything
in your district
is under control?

1031
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:13,303
BECK: Hans,
I need your answer.

1032
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:15,054
There's no more time
for indecision.

1033
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:17,765
And the General knows
I'm waiting?

1034
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,309
I'm ordering you
to put him on
the phone immediately.

1035
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:21,227
The army gave their oath
to a liar, Hans.

1036
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,562
STAUFFENBERG: Hello?

1037

BECK:
One who's broken
his own oath...

1038

Hello?
...to the people
a hundred times over.

1039
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:28,276
Hans, listen to me...

1040
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,847

has been terminated!
Stand down!

an attempt was made
on the Führer's life.

1042
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:09,359
The Führer himself
suffered no major injuries

1043
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:11,319
beyond light burns
and bruises.

1044
01:39:11,403 --> 01:39:13,780
He resumed his work
immediately.

1045
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:16,449
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

1046

Colonel Brandt
and staff assistant Berger.

1047
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,871
Lighter injuries
were sustained by
General Jodl

1048

Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

1049
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:28,544

1054
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:48,106
whom the almighty God
has so visibly blessed today.

1055
01:39:51,944 --> 01:40:00,076

Shortly after the attempt
on his life,

1067
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:44,203
the Führer was joined
by Reichsmarschall G鰎ing

1068
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:47,915
and, as scheduled,
received Mussolini for
an afternoon briefing.

1069

Stay tuned for
the Führer's address
to the German people.

My family?

1071
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,466
Our lines have been cut.

1072
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:01,763
I'm sorry.

1073
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,891
Go.

1074
01:41:05,434 --> 01:41:07,226
It's all right. Go.

1075
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:26,954

We have to get
you out of here.

Get him out of here.

Stop!
STAUFFENBERG:
Stand down!

1080
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:59,922
I said stop!
I said stand down!

1082
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:28,993

Colonel Stauffenberg?

1084
01:43:43,425 --> 01:43:46,385
By orders of the Führer,
you're under arrest.

1085
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:12,578
If you have any last messages
to your wives and children,

1086
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,497
I will hear them now.

1087
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:17,875
Very well.

1088
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,086
A court-martial convened by me
in the Führer's absence

1089
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:21,295
will pronounce sentence.

1090
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,256
Beck, you're under arrest.

General Olbricht,
Lieutenant Haeften,

and the Colonel whose name
I will not mention,

1093
01:44:31,014 --> 01:44:32,390
are condemned to death.

1094
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,934
General. My orders are
to take these men alive.

1095
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:36,519
Noted, Major.

1096
01:44:38,146 --> 01:44:40,189
I'd like a pistol,
please.

1097
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:44,777
For personal reasons.

1098
01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:04,588
Get on with it.

1099
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:06,882
With all respect...
That will be all, Major.

1100
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:09,260
Killing us won't hide
your involvement.

1101
01:45:09,344 --> 01:45:12,596
FROMM: My involvement?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1102
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:13,973
You knew and did nothing.

1103
01:45:14,057 --> 01:45:15,516
You're as guilty
as any of us.

1104
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,435
FROMM:
Spare me, Lieutenant.

1105
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:19,770
No one will be spared.

1106

earlier times.

1108
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:47,006
This is an outrage
that has never before
been perpetrated here!

A field marshal
and a general

1110

declare that they could
do things better

1111
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,930
than he who is
the Führer of us all!

1112
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:58,642
You confess to
having said this?
Yes.

1113

HITLER: My fellow Germans.

1114
01:46:05,442 --> 01:46:08,110
I speak to you tonight
for two reasons.

1115
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:13,616
First, so that
you can hear my voice
and know that I am unhurt.

1116
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:18,621
Second, so that you may know
the details of a crime

without parallel
in German history.

1118
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:26,045
A small clique of ambitious,
dishonorable officers

1119
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:28,464
have conspired
to eliminate me.

1120
01:46:29,966 --> 01:46:35,471
Except for
a few bruises and burns,
I was completely untouched.

1121
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,809
I see in this
the hand of Providence,

1122
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:43,604
directing me
to complete my work.

1123
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,074
Look them in the eye.

1124
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:59,412
