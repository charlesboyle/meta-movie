00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,138
I watch a lot of cop show
on TV...

178
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,767
Isn't there suppose to also be...

179
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,749
Isn't there suppose to be
a good cop?

180
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:30,768
Oh yes. But we're not done yet.

181
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:34,283
Hi, buddy. I'm your friendly
neighberhood police officer.

182
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,499
Would you like a glass of water?
Yeah, yeah actually.

183
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,541
Too bad. Security Cameras
picked up this.

184
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:42,113
You were found
at the construction site.

185
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:44,231
Convulsing with a strange piece.
That's disgusting.

186
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:47,052
Then why is it permenantly
stuck to your back?

187
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,432
What?

188
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:52,636
Take it back, get off me.
Oh come on it's chasing me!

189
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:56,180
Look, It's not my fault. I have no
idea how this thing got on my back.

190
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:58,692
Of course, buddy, I believe you.
Great!

191
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,788
I believe you too.

192
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:03,438
You see the quotations I'm making
with my claw hands?

193
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:05,737
It means I don't believe you.

194
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:08,014
Why else would you show up
with that thing on your back.

195
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,972
Just three days before President.
Business is going to use the Kragle.

196
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:14,497
To end the world?
President Business is gonna end the world?

197
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:15,929
But he's such a good guy.

198
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,266
And Octam. They make good stuff.

199
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:21,170
<i>Music, dairy products,
coffee, TV shows,</i>

200
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:24,665
<i>Surveillance systems,
All history books, voting machines...</i>

201
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,040
Wait a minute.
Come on, you can't be this stupid.

202
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,790
Come on..
This is a misunderstanding.

203
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,804
I'm just a regular
normal, ordinary guy

204
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:34,295
and I'm late to meet
My Best Friends in the whole world

205
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:36,984
and they're probably missing me right now.
They are probably out looking around.

206
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:39,494
"Hey Where's Emmet?"
"Where's my Best friend Emmet?".

207
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:42,265
You know what? Ask all my friends.
They will tell you.

208
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,608
Oh. We asked them alright. BOOM.

209
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:47,904
That guy
He's not a criminal mastermind.

210
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:50,125
<i>See? He is always kind of a...</i>

211
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,598
<i>Average.. Normal kind of guy.
Thank you.</i>

212
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,814
<i>But he's not like normal like us...</i>

213
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:00,510
<i>He's not that special.</i>

214
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,975
<i>I'm so confused...
Who are we talking about?</i>

215
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:08,068
<i>Wait, does he work with us?
Gail does not remember me?</i>

216
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:09,518
<i>Look at Randy here.</i>

217
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,975
<i>He likes sausage, that's something.</i>

218
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,983
<i>Gail is perky, that's something.</i>

219
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:19,869
<i>And Harry well... - When you say Harry,
I go ...Ha..Haa .ha. a ha ha haaa.</i>

220
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,746
And when you say <i>
the other guy, I go...</i>

221
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,795
<i>I know that guy,
But I know like zippy-zap about him.</i>

222
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,254
We just talked earlier.

223
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:36,711
And all I am mean he does is say yes
to everything everybody else is doing.

224
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,976
He's just sort of a..

225
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:40,292
And a little bit of a...

226
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:42,211
Blank slate I guess.

227
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,384
<i>That will be $ 42, please.</i>

228
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:48,478
We all have something that makes
us something, and Emmet is...

229
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,572
Nothing.

230
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:55,727
There you go.

231
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:58,067
I told you I said I was nobody.

232
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:02,969
It's the perfect cover.
Cover? Cover for what?

233
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,461
I can't break him. Take him to the
melting chamber.

234
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,629
What? No!

235
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,145
No!!!

236
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:10,951
No!!!

237
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:13,408
You're going to melt me?
Am I gonna die?

238
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:16,028
You'll live You'll be fine.

239
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,520
President Business,
I have him right here, sir.

240
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:21,830
Yes. We have told him he'll live
so he doesn't try to escape.

241
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:24,268
But, eh.. we're lying to him.

242
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,850
Wait, what did he just say?

243
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:27,903
Hold still.

244
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:31,278
Wait! There's obviously been a mixup here.
You got the wrong...

245
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,079
That is going to start hurting
pretty soon.

246
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:06,867
No, no, no no. Ohh who.

247
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:08,579
Ohh, whoahh.

248
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:09,943
Who are you?

249
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:17,894
It's you?
Come with me if you wanna not die.

250
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,312
Hi, everybody!

251
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:24,832
How's the melting...
Hey, hey, hey hey!

252
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,151
Red Alert! Red Alert!
I need everyone.

253
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:29,638
Repeat, everyone to go after
the special.

254
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:33,640
The tunnel's that way.

255
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,960
Oh boy.

256
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:38,772
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.

257
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:41,022
We'll build a motorcycle
out of the alleyway.

258
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:47,570
GEAR

259
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,813
So, Ah.. Didn't catch your name.

260
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:58,380
Or anything about..
What you're up to,

261
00:14:58,381 --> 00:14:59,686
or what we're doing here.

262
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:02,923
It's brilliant sir that you've had it being
a useless nobody,

263
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:05,054
But, you can drop the act,
with me, It's cool.

264
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,358
Oh, the act?

265
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:13,777
Jump on. Let's go.

266
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:20,509
Hang on, sir.

267
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,498
All units,
Cut 'em off on neon, now!

268
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:24,802
Or whatever you can.

269
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:26,620
10-4, bad cop!

270
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,340
- Watch out!
- Hold on.

271
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:34,090
We need to meet-up with Vitruvius
tell him the piece has been found.

272
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:35,954
Ah-ha.
They're up on the motor rail.

273
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:38,034
Release the Copper-chopper.

274
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,417
Oh no!

275
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:51,795
Can you please tell me
what is happening?

276
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:54,473
I'm rescuing you, sir.
You're the one the prophecy spoke of.

277
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:56,668
- You're the Special.
- Me?

278
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:00,420
You've found
The piece of resistance.

279
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,275
And the prophecy states.

280
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:05,964
That you're the most important,
The most talented, interesting

281
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,758
and the most extraordinary
in the universe.

282
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,677
That's you, right?

283
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,659
Yes, that's me.

284
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,673
Great. You drive. What?

285
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,882
I wanna go home.

286
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,576
This is not what I meant.

287
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:43,141
Oh no! Look out, Special.

288
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:45,711
Sorry!
Never driven a motorcycle, sorry.

289
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,801
Wow, that's amazing.

290
00:16:56,262 --> 00:17:00,061
That was incredible. Your even better
then the prophecy said you'd be.

291
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,528
Really?
I'm Ahh.. I'm Wild-Style.

292
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,470
Oh, I'm sorry what was it?
Wild-Style.

293
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:06,774
- Wild-Style?
- Yep.

294
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,162
- What are you a DJ?
- No.

295
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:10,242
Oh then that's your name, It's Wild-Style?
Yeah.

296
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,134
Like on your birth certificate
it's says Wild-Style?

297
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,204
Let's not talk about my name.

298
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:16,131
Don't let the Special get away.
We block the freeway.

299
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:17,486
Hang on, sir.

300
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:19,352
What are you doing?

301
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:22,629
Let's fly.

302
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,022
Head for the secret tunnel.

303
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,632
These are the city limits.
Let's just head for the tunnel.

304
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:31,916
You want me to drive to that
wierd swirly hole?

305
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,415
- Are you insane?
- Don't break, go! Don't stop, go. Now!

306
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:38,265
Can't do this.
That is against the instructions.

307
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:41,771
Wait. What's your favorite restaurant?
Any chian restaurant.

308
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:43,570
Favorite TV Show?
Where are my pants.

309
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,675
Favorite song?
Everything is awesome.

310
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:46,979
Oh no.

311
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:57,869
Darn, darn, darn! Darny darn!

312
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,210
Wait. Where are we?

313
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,399
THE OLD WEST

314
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,515
This is so weird...

315
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:46,053
You're not the special.
You lied to me!

316
00:18:46,054 --> 00:18:48,009
Well I mean.. It
depends..It realy kinda..

317
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,146
Your'e not even a
Master Builder, are you?

318
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,994
Well, I know what a Master Builder is.

319
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:55,206
Why don't you tell me what it is
that way I can see if you're right?

320
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,149
You ruined the prophecy.

321
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,972
Look, I'm Sorry, Ok?
You just that...

322
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,595
Made being a Special
sound so good.

323
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:06,817
And to think I was going to follow you
to the end of the universe.

324
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,587
You were?

325
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,887
Well here is the thing, how do we
know for sure that I'm not the special?

326
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,762
We just don't know it yet...
Quiet.

327
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:16,671
Yo warn you want a giant turkey leg?

328
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,675
You have any idea
what it does to your..

329
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,075
Oh My G-o-s-h!

330
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:24,378
Just put the hat on.

331
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,566
Oh, and this, and this
and this, and this.

332
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,548
And by the way,
I have a boyfriend.

333
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:33,058
Ahhh.. not sure exactly
why you'd bring that up.

334
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,732
It's super serious
and you do not want to mess with him.

335
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,119
- Ok.
- So. Don't get any ideas.

336
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,158
I never have any ideas. Wait!

337
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,230
Take 'em up you felles
hands where I can see them.

338
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,923
Hey, listen do'ye think you can explain
to me like why am I dressed like this,

339
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:51,495
with this big words in the sky were all
about and like where we are, in time?

340
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:56,440
Your home, Bricksberg
is one of many realms in the universe.

341
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:59,402
There is also this one, the Pirates club,
Knights club, vikings land,

342
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:02,482
and the clown town, and bunch others
that we don't need to mention.

343
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:06,111
Lord Business, or as you think you know
him, President Business,

344
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:09,439
Stole the Kragle,
the most powerful object in the universe.

345
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,743
Blah, blah, blah...

346
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:14,336
Proper name, Place name
and stuff...

347
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:16,601
It's the Special.

348
00:20:16,602 --> 00:20:19,099
I am so pretty I like you

349
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,326
but I'm angry with you
for some reason.

350
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:26,848
Putting the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle and disarm it forever.

351
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:28,309
Great.

352
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,999
I think I got it,
but just in case...

353
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,577
tell me the all thing again.
I wasn't listening.

354
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:36,862
<i>OK. All of the people in the universe</i>

355
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:41,201
<i>were once free to travel,
and mingle and build whatever they wanted.</i>

356
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:44,263
<i>But President Business
was confused by all the chaos.</i>

357
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:46,680
<i>So he erected walls between
the worlds.</i>

358
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:49,321
<i>And came obcessed
with order and perfection.</i>

359
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:52,461
<i>And he stole a mysterious
secret-super weapon called.</i>

360
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:54,954
<i>The Kragle!
And he hired Bad Cop to hunt down</i>

361
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,313
<i>all the master builders
Who were always changing everything.</i>

362
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:01,177
<i>Those of us who remained
well we went to hiding</i>

363
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,296
<i>built a tunnel to survive.</i>

364
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:05,367
And we searched for the
Piece of the resistance.

365
00:21:05,368 --> 00:21:08,423
The only thing that can
stop the Kragle.

366
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:10,057
Kragle. I know that.

367
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:12,500
That might have been that cop
He said something about the Kragle.

368
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:15,531
The President Business was going
to use the Kragle to end the world

369
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:17,448
in three days.
I can't make any sense of it.

370
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:18,751
The Taco Tuesday.

371
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:21,183
I knew that was suspicous.
There is no time to lose.

372
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:24,433
We must find Vitruvius and get to the
Office Tower before it's too late.

373
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:27,911
Ok. How scary can
someones' office be?

374
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:36,268
THE PRESIDENT BUSINESS OFFICE

375
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:39,667
President Business, we're
trying to locate the fugitive

376
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:42,987
but his face is so generic, it matches
any other face in owr database.

377
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:45,596
Diabolical. Ok.

378
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:49,917
Have Bad cop meet me in my office
in 23 seconds. Ciao!

379
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,832
Coffee sales are through
the roof, sir.

380
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,745
Great to hear it. Let's rebuild
that roof to be even higher.

381
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,048
The Roof Team is on it!

382
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,230
Sir, can you approve this Poster
for Taco Tuesday?

383
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:00,706
Perfect!
WOO!! I love everyone in this room.

384
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:02,381
- We love you, sir.
- Hey, guys.

385
00:22:02,382 --> 00:22:04,099
Great job on the radio seg.!
Thank you, sir.

386
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,615
We love listening to
this song over and over again.

387
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:11,163
Keep it up, guys.
Honey, Where are my pants?

388
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:15,350
Hilarious. That never gets old.
It does not.

389
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:18,030
Bad Cop is waiting
for you, in your office.

390
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:21,484
Wonderful, fantastic.
Would you cancel my 2 o'clock?

391
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:25,076
This meeting can run
a little bit deadly.

392
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,327
<i>Activating Helmet.</i>

393
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,629
<i>Light sequence.</i>

394
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,651
<i>Flames attached.
Engage dramatic entrance.</i>

395
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,719
- Bad-Cop.
- Lord Business,

396
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,413
I know the Special got away,
but...

397
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:47,821
Don't be so serious.
Where's the other guy?

398
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:50,835
Hey. Hey, buddy. I missed you.

399
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,138
Oh.. Did you really?

400
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,000
Have I ever shown you my relic collection?
Nope.

401
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:56,939
I don't think you have.
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.

402
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,924
This one is the cloak of Ban-da-id.

403
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,172
I heard it's super painful
to take off. Do you want to try it on?

404
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,670
Well, I... No, but thank you.

405
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:07,590
We got some great work over the years
together bad-cop.

406
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:09,747
Capturing all those
Master Builders

407
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,687
and torturing them,
and what not.

408
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:13,909
- Thank you, sir.
- Although,

409
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,674
You did let the Piece of Resistance go.

410
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:17,416
The one thing the could ruin my plans.

411
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:19,815
The one thing I asked you to take care of.

412
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:21,983
That's super frustrating.

413
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:26,482
It makes me want to pick up whoever
is standing closest to me

414
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:32,487
and just throw him through this window and
out into the infinite abyss of nothingness.

415
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:37,740
But I want to do it so bad.

416
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:40,269
I know you do, sir.
But Please, please don't.

417
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,747
And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.

418
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:47,704
People everywhere are
always messing with my stuff.

419
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:50,131
But I have a way to fix that.

420
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:56,345
 A way to keep things exactly the way
they are supposed to be. Permanently.

421
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,182
Behold!

422
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:02,525
The most powerful weapon
of all the realms.

423
00:24:03,312 --> 00:24:05,793
The Kragle!

424
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:13,296
As you can see, they're loading
the Kragle on a big machine upstairs.

425
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:17,675
I call it the Tentacle
Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.

426
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:19,827
Or TAKOS. The "S" is silent.

427
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:25,484
So on Taco Tuesday, it will spread the
Kragle over everyone and everything

428
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:28,729
with the bunch of super
scary nozzle, like this one.

429
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,039
I'll show you how it works.
Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

430
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,484
Oh, Don't worry.
I won't test it on you.

431
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:36,593
I'll do it on your parents.

432
00:24:37,152 --> 00:24:39,014
- What?
- Hiya, son.

433
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:41,897
Hi.
How is it going in the big city?

434
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,408
Mommy, Daddy.
What are you doing here?

435
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:46,996
Ok, pa.
I just want to you to act naturally.

436
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:49,302
- Like you were going 'bout your day.
- Got you.

437
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:51,005
Keep your hand up like that.

438
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:55,274
Ma, scoop two steps into the right.
Pa, why do...

439
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:57,222
Whenever I talk to Ma,
you start to move.

440
00:24:57,223 --> 00:24:59,350
I'm sorry, sir.
Get back to where you were.

441
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:01,177
- Here?
- Perfect. That's great.

442
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:02,813
,You can't do anything better
There's no reason why you should move.

443
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:04,117
Right. Now, Ma,

444
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:06,997
hand on his shoulder,
and you... Pa, you're just moving.

445
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:09,309
And you just wrecked it!
You wrecked it!

446
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,619
Bad cop, you see what I'm talking about.

447
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,430
All I'm asking for is
Total perfection.

448
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,504
Send in the Micromanager.

449
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:22,128
What are you doing?
My god, what is this?

450
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:25,946
Hold still you guys.

451
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:32,178
Then, I'll just spray them with TACO.

452
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,740
- Oh pa, hold me.
- Oh darling.

453
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:38,820
Can't move me legs.

454
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:43,578
Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
Surely, you feel bad for your parents.

455
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:46,441
And you want to help them, Don't you?
We're Ok, son.

456
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:48,387
Just a little stuck, that's all.

457
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:50,256
Go ahead,

458
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:53,957
finish the job.

459
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,772
Of course, sir. No, I don't want to.

460
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:58,537
You have to. I don't want to.

461
00:25:58,538 --> 00:25:59,841
Would you -Please be quiet.
I can't.

462
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,144
You must. But they...

463
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:02,447
Shut it! It's not nice...

464
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:05,944
It's your job, man!
I can't do it, they're innocent.

465
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:07,248
Just as I thought.

466
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:10,184
Your Good Cop side is
making you soft, Bad Cop.

467
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:13,132
Robots, bring me the
Police crest inceptor and

468
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:15,890

Remover of na-eel!

You Already left the
Special get away once.

470
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,235
- Sir. - We're just gonna make
sure it doesn't happen again.

471
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:24,471
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

472
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:31,455
- Oh, son!

00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:37,443
that everyone will stop
messing with my stuff.

475
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:39,209
Or you're gonna be with me.

476
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,915
Or you gonna be stuck having a tea
party with your mom and dad?

477
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:47,385
Son. Sorry, Dad.

478
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:50,513
I have a job to do.

479
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:10,595
All you have to do
is blend in and act like you belong here.

480
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:14,090
Perfect. Hi there, I'm a cowboy.

481
00:27:14,714 --> 00:27:16,214
Bang bang, b, b bang bang.

482
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:20,216
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Bullet Bullet, gun.

483
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,326
- What are they looking at?
- I made a mistake.

484
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:24,158
You should be just still,
Act like a stool.

485
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,183
- Howdy, guys?
- Wait, No, stool don't talk.

486
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:28,599
- Don't sit on me.

487
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:30,629
Let me show you how it's done.

488
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:38,091
What a lady

489
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:43,000
Ok. We'll just find the wizard
and get this over with.

490
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:50,255
Psst, there he is.

491
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:54,489
Vitruvius.
Who? I've never heard of that man.

492
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,540
Who I am not. Who are you?
It's me.

493
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,479
I am a blind man and cannot see.

494
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,003
- It's Wild-Style.
- Are you a DJ?

495
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:05,083
Why does everybody? Wait, wait.

496
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:08,371
Were you the student I used to have who
was so insecure who kept changing his name?

497
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:10,355
No, no. Yeah, first Dark Storm,

498
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,451
Then Jemminy, then Wild-Style then...
No, no.

499
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:14,307
Smazzy Pants. Okay, yes.

500
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:17,128
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.

501
00:28:19,102 --> 00:28:22,077
"10" SECONDS LATER

502
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,980
Wow! Man...

503
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:30,459
You have a very wierdly
decorated place.

504
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,298
- Thank you.
- Vitruvius.

505
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:35,551
- We have found the Piece of Resistance.
- Is it true?

506
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:38,977
Yeah, but...
Wild-Style, the prophecy states that.

507
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:43,336
You are the Special.
Embodiment of good, foiler of evil,

508
00:28:43,337 --> 00:28:45,611
the most talented,
the most briliant,

509
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:48,148
The most important person
in the universe.

510
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:54,092
That would be great but...
Emmet is the one who found the piece.

511
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:58,753
Okay, Emmet! The prophecy says
you are states that you are the Special.

512
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:01,215
The most talented...
I'm not sure he's the Special, actually

513
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:03,585
because he's not
even a Master Builder.

514
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:06,190
Watch. Emmet, just give a watch around,
you and build something simple.

515
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,331
Great. Like an awesome race car.

516
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:09,635
Do you have the instructions?
No.

517
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:13,321
You must create the instructions
in your mind, my leige.

518
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,648
Oh, Ok. Racecar.

519
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:19,165
Well, There's a lot of really cool stuff
here.

520
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:24,074
Don't see.. a wheel or...

521
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,015
three more wheels.

522
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:33,362
See? He can't do it.
He will never be a master builder.

523
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:35,854
Of course not. Not if you keep
telling him he can't.

524
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:37,668
He need to see that he can.

525
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:39,779
What are you doing?
We are entering your mind.

526
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,834
What are you doing?
We are entering your mind.

527
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:44,795
To prove to you have the unlocked potential
of a good to be Master Builder.

528
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:54,195
Wow. Are we inside
my brain right now?

529
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:56,407
It's big. I must be smart.

530
00:29:57,107 --> 00:29:59,726
I'm not hear a lot of
activity here.

531
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:02,469
I don't think he ever had
an original thought in his life.

532
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,829
Haha. That's not true.
For instance,

533
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,266
once time I want to have a
bunch of my friends to watch TV.

534
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,866
Not unlike this TV
that just showed up magically.

535
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:14,159
And not everybody
can fit in on my one couch.

536
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,462
And I thought to myself:

537
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:18,683
Well, what if there's such a thing
as a bunk-bed, but as a couch.

538
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:21,179
Introducing, the double-decker couch.

539
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,105
So everybody would watches TV
together, and be buddies.

540
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:27,020
That is literaly the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

541
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:29,425
Please Wild-Style,
let me handle this.

542
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:32,784
That idea was just the worst.

543
00:30:32,785 --> 00:30:36,540
There must be something around here
that proves his potential.

544
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:39,037
If the man upstairs chose
him to be the Special,

545
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,482
There must be a reason.
Who is the man upstairs?

546
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:43,828
See? He does't even know
about the man upstairs.

547
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:47,513
He has like super gross hands* that
looke like they're made out of sausages

548
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,425
like Eagle talons mixed with squid.

549
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:52,329
You are seeing that...

550
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:56,240
Whoahh that's what I was just
thinking about.

551
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:56,642
How did you...

552
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:58,101
I had this weird dream
that I touch the piece

553
00:30:58,102 --> 00:31:00,565
but I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.

554
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,911
Emmet, you had a vision.

555
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,709
I did?... Master Builders

556
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,614
spend years training themselves
to clear their minds enough

557
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,017
to have even a fleeting glimpse of
the Man upstairs. And yet..

558
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:14,966
Your mind is already so prodigiously empty

559
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:18,387
that, there is nothing in it to clear away
in the first place.

560
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:21,048
With proper training,
you could become.

561
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,356
- A great Master-builder.
- I could?

562
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:25,571
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

563
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:29,795
I can't do any of the stuff, that the
prophecy says I'm supposed to do.

564
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:32,363
All you have to do

565
00:31:32,564 --> 00:31:33,434
is to believe.

566
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:37,887
Then you will see everything.

567
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:40,022
Are you ready, my son?

568
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:44,739
Yes, I am.

569
00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:47,001
I think.

570
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:48,962
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

571
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:53,061
We must assemble... The
Master Builders.

572
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:55,651
Do you think Zepellins
are a bad investment?

573
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:10,584
Any of you Fella's seen this guy?

574
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:15,976
Wait a minute, partner.
Draw a cowboy hat on him.

575
00:32:17,774 --> 00:32:19,129
WANTED

576
00:32:22,261 --> 00:32:24,715
These mechanical birds
will get our message out.

577
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:27,103
They will go to an Internet cafe
and e-mail

578
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:29,595
the remaining Master Builders,
who will utilise this in the secret realm

579
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:31,499
of cloud cuckoo land.

580
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,559
Cuckoo land? But what happened
to that whole training part.

581
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,015
Don't worry, Emmet.
Your training begins now.

582
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:43,213
- You in there open up.
- Your training begins later.

583
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,068
On three. 1...

584
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:56,978
- I think we're in the clear.
- Freeze, Turkeys

585
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,641
All I want is a piece of resistance.

586
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:02,103
We You would rather 'he die'
than give it to you.

587
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:04,520
I would not rather... He died...

588
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:07,973
Look everybody we can do this
the easy way or we can do it...

589
00:33:07,974 --> 00:33:09,723
Go! Run!! Do it the hard way.

590
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:11,025
Fire! Fire!

591
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,702
Vitruvius, which way
to cloud cuckoo land.

592
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:16,756
Head for the big bright thing
in the sky.

593
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:18,419
You mean the sun? Yeah, yeah,
thats it

594
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,607
lets get out of here. Use this.

595
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,677
What are you doing? Lets go!

596
00:33:24,276 --> 00:33:26,067
I don't know what I'm doing.

597
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:30,958
Goodbye!

598
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,662
Oh dang!

599
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,673
I've got Pigs!

600
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:47,701
I hate pigs! Guys quit playing
around the mud I could use your help

601
00:33:47,702 --> 00:33:50,538
Wild-Style,
I could really use your help.

602
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,408
Oink!

603
00:34:10,694 --> 00:34:13,286
Vitruvius, they're gaining on us.
Build something.

604
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:15,631
- Let the Emmet try.
- No, let not let Emmet try.

605
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:17,507
- I haven't had any training.
- Thats OK.

606
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:20,097
Let's start with how to become
A Master Builder.

607
00:34:20,098 --> 00:34:22,708
Step 1: Trust your instincts.

608
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:24,565
Okay. Build-something!

609
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,736
Build something!

610
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Take that

611
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,120
Harness your instincts
are terrible.

612
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,514
No The wheel.

613
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:49,042
I can't control it much longer.

614
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:52,123
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

615
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,806
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

616
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:57,495
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

617
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:00,791
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

618
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:04,205
Spins around round round round
Ohhh

619
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:07,661
Emmet, where you going?

620
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,387
Ohh this better work.
Hang tight!

621
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:15,843
Dang damn it.

622
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,308
Well done Emmet!

623
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:24,458
Hey Haaaay -I did it!
Wow you actually did it!

624
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,034
Train!

625
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:36,508
Oh no!

626
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,056
- Get out off my train.
- Run!

627
00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:45,997
Wild-Style.

628
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:51,254
He's gonna ram us.

629
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,699
Quick quick, I have an idea,
Give me that piece.

630
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:56,671
Now, the ramp.

631
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:06,168
- What the heck?
- Rest in pieces.

632
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:10,763
Ohh No!
Wait! Wait! No no

633
00:36:19,558 --> 00:36:21,753
Hey thanks for saving my life
back there.

634
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:26,624
Even if, you know eventually
you turn out to be pointless.

635
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:29,465
Well for what its worth it.

636
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:33,295
This has been about the greatest
15 minutes of my life.

637
00:36:39,476 --> 00:36:40,778
What ...The.

638
00:36:43,753 --> 00:36:46,351
- Relax everybody, I'm here.
- Batman!

639
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:47,678
- Whats up, babe?
- Babe!

640
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,910
What?
Oh sorry. Batman This is Emmett.

641
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:52,309
Emmet,
this is my boyfriend, Batman.

642
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,775
I'm Batman.

643
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,079
That's your boyfriend?

644
00:36:58,712 --> 00:37:01,900
- Batman? Huh Where'd you guys meet?
- Its actually a funny story.

645
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:03,203
Right Bat?

646
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:04,507
There he is.

647
00:37:04,508 --> 00:37:05,872
Police to meet you, Bad Cop.

648
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:08,195
The pleasure was all mine.

649
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:10,991
You big dumb baby

650
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,100
Your car is a baby chariot

651
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:16,781
Ohh no Your boyfriends gone.

652
00:37:16,782 --> 00:37:19,472

653
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:24,140
Sooo ahh hey Guys...

654
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:27,766
I think we're gonna crash into the sun.
Yeh but its gonna look really cool.

655
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:36,891
Ahh is this cloud cuckoo land?
I don't see any clouds.

656
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:39,936
Or cuckoos.
No, No, this is middle Zealand.

657
00:37:39,937 --> 00:37:41,239
A Wondrousl land.

658
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,729
Full of knights,
castles, mutton, torture weapons,

659
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,632
poverty, leeches,
Illiteracy and...

660
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:49,508
Dragon!

661
00:37:49,509 --> 00:37:51,023
Yep, That too.

662
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:55,904
Once we arrive at cloud cuckoo land.

663
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:57,676
We'll raise an army of
Master Builders...

664
00:37:57,677 --> 00:38:00,988
Anyway, you guys got to check out
this new subwoofers I installed in the back

665
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:03,323
I call it the Dog.
Just listen to them bark.

666
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:07,555
Can you turn that down a bit?
This is a song I wrote

667
00:38:07,556 --> 00:38:08,967
for Wild-Style

668
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:12,377
<i>Darkness.
It's about me being an orphan.</i>

669
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:13,986
<i>No parents</i>

670
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:17,288
This is real music, Emmet.
The Batman is a true artist.

671
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:21,117
He's dark, rooting
Well I'm dark and rooting too

672
00:38:21,118 --> 00:38:25,080
- Guys, look, a rainbow!
- So you gonna drive up the curve part

673
00:38:26,061 --> 00:38:27,503
Take it all the way to the top.

674
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:29,893
And park the car.

675
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:33,718
Friends,
welcome to cloud cuckoo land!

676
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,022
Now...

677
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,888
I just need to give
the secret knock.

678
00:38:51,382 --> 00:38:53,516
Okay...

679
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:03,173
I just want to come right out,
I have no idea what's going on

680
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,900
Or what is that place is at all.
Hello, I'm am Princess Uni-Kitty

681
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:11,647
and I welcome you all
to cloud cuckoo land

682
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:17,850
but theres no signs or anything.
How does anyone know what not to do?

683
00:39:17,851 --> 00:39:20,992
Here In Cloud cuckoo land
there are no rules!

684
00:39:20,993 --> 00:39:25,605
There's no government, no babysitters,
no bedtime.

685
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:29,445
No frowning faces
No bushy moustaches,

686
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:33,974
And no negativity of any kind.
You just said the word 'no'

687
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:36,531
Like a thousand times.
and there also no consistency

688
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:40,790
- I hate this place.
- Any idea is a good idea,

689
00:39:40,814 --> 00:39:42,483
Except the not happy ones

690
00:39:42,484 --> 00:39:44,482
Those you push down deep inside

691
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:49,835
where you'll, never, never,
ever find them.

692
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:52,671
Your fellow Master Builders
are gathered in the dog.

693
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:53,976
The WHAT?!!

694
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,995
- Is that Superman?
- Bonjour!

695
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,732
Girl,
What are you doing right now?

696
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,035
It's Superman! Hey, what's up?

697
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:06,106
Lantern. Green Lantern.
You want to sit together at the meeting?

698
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:09,018
I have to go back to Krypton.

699
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:10,436
Didn't Krypton blow up?

700
00:40:10,437 --> 00:40:11,914
My fellow Master Builders,

701
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:14,314
including, but not limited to
Robin Hood,

702
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:16,774
Mermaid lady, Gandalf
Swamp creature

703
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:18,503
1980's ...something space guy.
Hi!

704
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:21,452
2002 NBA All Stars
and Wonder Woman.

705
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,766
You have traveled far to be here,
for a moment of great importance.

706
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:31,113
We have learned that Lord Business
plans to unleash a full weaponised Kragle

707
00:40:31,114 --> 00:40:35,404
on Taco Tuesday, to end
the world as we know it.

708
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,040
Please!, calm yourselves.
Green Ninja, Milhouse,

709
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:43,054
Nice Vampires, Michelangelo,
Michalangelo and Cleopatra.

710
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:47,402
There is yet one hope,
the Special has arisen.

711
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:51,787
- Have the young man step forward.
- As you wish, Dobledore.

712
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:54,628
I'm the Gandalf.
Its Pronounced Dumbledore.

713
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:56,627
Dobledore? No! Dumbledore!

714
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,463
- You said Dobledore.
- Vitruvius!

715
00:40:58,464 --> 00:41:01,744
Time to get away right now, cos I'm not
going to remember any of it...but here we go.

716
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:06,945
The Special will now
give an eloquent speech.

717
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,594
Go ahead man you got this.

718
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:16,180
Okay.

719
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,041
Hello, I'm Emmet.

720
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,316
Ohh And this is
the piece of Resistence.

721
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:37,836
Thank you.

722
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,678
Well ..

723
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,839
I know that I for one am very excited
to work with you guys.

724
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,326
Get into the octant tower

725
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:47,791
find the Kragle
and put this thing on the thing.

726
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:50,939
And I know its going to be really
hard...

727
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,953
Really hard?

728
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:57,221
Wiping your bum with a hook
for a hand is really hard.

729
00:41:57,222 --> 00:41:59,018
This be impossible!

730
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,564
The last time we tried to storm
Lord Business's office.

731
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:04,334
We used every plan we could conceive.

732
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:08,532
The result was a massacre too terrible to
speak of.

733
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:11,932
Who are you? The name be Metal Beard.

734
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:16,377
- I will tell you me tale of woe.
- Oh great here we go again.

735
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:21,525
I arrived at the foot of the tower, with me
hardy Master builder crew

736
00:42:21,526 --> 00:42:26,029
Only to find the Kragle was all the
way up on the infinity-th floor.

737
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,533
Guarded by a Robot army

738
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:32,601
and security measures of every kind
imagineable.

739
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:33,951
Lasers.

740
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:35,664
Sharks.

741
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,940
Laser Sharks.

742
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:40,667
Overbearing assistants.

743
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:46,300
And strange dangerous relics
that entrap, snap, and zap.

744
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:50,599
And there be a mysterious room
called The Think-tank.

745
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:55,292
I barely made it out one with just me head

746
00:42:56,558 --> 00:42:58,561
and organs.

747
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:01,534
- Okayyy.
- I had to replace every part

748
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:04,520
my once strapping virile
Pirate body

749
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:08,506
with this useless hunk of garbage,
You see before you.

750
00:43:08,507 --> 00:43:10,801
So if ye think it be a good idea
to return

751
00:43:10,802 --> 00:43:14,437
to that forsaken place, Special

752
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:19,119
What idea have you, that be better
than the ideas of 100

753
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,839
of our fallen
Master Builder brothers.

754
00:43:22,215 --> 00:43:26,703
Well technically, I'm not exactly
a Master Builder yet.

755
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,105
WHAT?

756
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,172
Please, everyone ...everyone
Please...

757
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:35,212
Rubbish. Yeah, it's true.

758
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,714
I may not be a Master Builder,

759
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,504
I may not have a
lot of experience.

760
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:43,571
Fighting, or leading
or coming up with plans.

761
00:43:44,342 --> 00:43:46,491
Or having ideas in general.

762
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:49,716
In fact, I'm not all that smart.

763
00:43:50,555 --> 00:43:54,151
And I'm not what you'd call
creative type.

764
00:43:54,562 --> 00:43:58,442
Plus, generally unskilled.

765
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:03,198
Also, scared, and cowardly.

766
00:44:04,136 --> 00:44:05,800
I know what you're thinking.

767
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:10,848
He is the least qualified person
in the world to lead us.

768
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,097
And you are right.

769
00:44:13,098 --> 00:44:16,751
Is that supposed to make us feel better?

770
00:44:16,752 --> 00:44:20,418
There was about to be a "but".
You're a but.

771
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:23,605
You'll all be on your own.

772
00:44:23,606 --> 00:44:26,317
I'll be leaving this lost cause.

773
00:44:28,037 --> 00:44:29,365
Why are you leaving?

774
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,873
A house divided against itself.

775
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:33,538
Would be better than this.

776
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,649
Abraham Lincoln. You Bring your
space chair right back here.

777
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,275
Come on, guys.

778
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,755
We can still do this, Right?

779
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:46,832
Well you were right about him being
a ding dong.

780
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:51,262
Get him outa here.

781
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:58,017
Well at least it can't get any worse.

782
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:01,594
I was wrong.

783
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,773
It's the orb of..

784
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:10,467
Oh-Ohh, its the bad guys.

785
00:45:11,472 --> 00:45:13,240
- How did he...
- Go!

786
00:45:13,241 --> 00:45:16,690
Come on everyone, protect the special.
Whats that on his angkle?

787
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:21,223
It's a tracking device.
Take the Master Builders prisoners.

788
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:25,412
Oh he lead them right to us
Guys, no no it's not my fault

789
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:29,221
You're the worst leader I have ever seen.
To the Batmobile.

790
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:32,562
- Dang it
- To the invisible jet

791
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:36,435
- Dang it
- Every man for himself.

792
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:38,436
No, we have to protect piece.

793
00:45:38,437 --> 00:45:42,374
Shaq, did you know what time it is?
It's game time.

794
00:45:44,977 --> 00:45:46,605
You'all ready for this?

795
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,420
Ohh no they were ready for that.

796
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:52,942
It didn't break. Because it's Kragled

797
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:54,244
Machine Gum.

798
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:56,112
Fire.

799
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,755
I can't move. Don't worry
Superman, I'll get you outa there.

800
00:46:00,756 --> 00:46:02,291
No don't

801
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,487
Ohh my Gosh, my hands are stuck.

802
00:46:04,488 --> 00:46:07,452
My legs are stuck as well.
I super hate you.

803
00:46:10,172 --> 00:46:13,520
- Bat, help me out here.
- I said, every man for himself.

804
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,219
Hey you gotta be there for me

805
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,553
Fine. Fine. Fine.

806
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:24,958
I need to have a better attitude about it.
I had a great attitute

807
00:46:25,982 --> 00:46:29,620
The special is in the northwest quadrant,
we've got him cornered.

808
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:32,441
Where'd he go?

809
00:46:37,314 --> 00:46:40,029
Oh no they have got out cloud stablizers.

810
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,938
Lets go We need to get
Emmet out of here!

811
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:43,418
Can't we build something?

812
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:45,277
Hey I'm Ben, but you can
call me Benny.

813
00:46:45,278 --> 00:46:47,102
Can I build a ship. Watch this

814
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,441
No you can't, the skies are surrounded

815
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:54,381
That's okay, I didn't want to really build
a space ship anyway that's cool

816
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:57,154
Where can we go where we can't be found?

817
00:46:57,155 --> 00:47:00,382
Maybe we can go underwater?
What if we went underwater?

818
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:02,330
Great idea, babe
Thank you, Batman.

819
00:47:02,331 --> 00:47:03,645
Your idea are the best.

820
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:05,725
But hey I just said that.
We could build a submarine.

821
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:08,742
- A-bat-submarine. Patent bending.
- With rainbows

822
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,083
And dreamcatchers,
in case we take a nap.

823
00:47:11,084 --> 00:47:14,016
Like an underwater spaceship.
But you can't built all of them at once.

824
00:47:14,017 --> 00:47:15,367
Ready? Break!

825
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:19,580
Okay... These are the colour I make,
Blue raspberry and sour apple.

826
00:47:19,581 --> 00:47:21,643
If anybody has black parts I need them okay

827
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:25,482
I only work in black, and sometimes
in very very dark gray.

828
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:27,244
- Use the yellow prints.
- You guys can I help?

829
00:47:27,268 --> 00:47:29,099
No, it has to be this way, no I need that

830
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,462
Where is he? Anyone know what this is?
And do you need it

831
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:36,685
- I could use wings, rocket boosters.
- Get our retro space out of my area

832
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:39,671
You guys hey tell me exactly what to do.
And how to do it.

833
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:42,834
Emmet, don't worry about
what the others are doing.

834
00:47:42,835 --> 00:47:46,677
You must embrace
what is special about you.

835
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:58,120
There he is. All Units attack the sub

836
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,944
Emmet, get in here.

837
00:48:09,488 --> 00:48:11,308
Stop him!

838
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:13,268
Don't let them get to the water.

839
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:15,803
Dive! Dive! Everybody in,
we're falling under

840
00:48:33,092 --> 00:48:34,394
Oh no.

841
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,190
My home...

842
00:48:58,183 --> 00:48:59,486
It's gone.

843
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:05,802
I feel something inside its like...

844
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:08,557
the opposite of happiness.

845
00:49:08,558 --> 00:49:12,094
I must stay positive.

846
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,096
Bubble gum.

847
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:19,048
Butterflies.

848
00:49:23,176 --> 00:49:25,006
Cotton Candy.

849
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:29,073
I'm so sorry, Uni-Kitty.

850
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,355
You want to sit down and talk about it?

851
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:36,990
What the heck is that?

852
00:49:36,991 --> 00:49:38,833
It's a double-decker couch.

853
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:44,476
Which seemed like a good idea, at the time,
but I now realise, its not super helpful.

854
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:49,585
But it has cup holders
seat flip up with coolers underneath.

855
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:54,018
You are so disappointing,
in so many levels.

856
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:57,135
Why are my pants cold and wet?

857
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:03,344
The wall are crying.
We are going to be part of the sea!

858
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,620
This is not how Batman dies.

859
00:50:07,493 --> 00:50:11,483
Emmet, hold on. Hold on. Wild-Style.

860
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:15,049
Deep breath. Deep breath everyone

861
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:35,363
Micro-managers, whats going
on down there?

862
00:50:36,217 --> 00:50:38,834
<i> Scanning submarine wreckage </i>

863
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:41,875
<i> No survivors detected.</i>

864
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:45,191
Scan the entire ocean of you have to

865
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:47,460
We've got to find that beast.

866
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:51,009
Let's take these prisoners back to Lord
Business and give him the good news.

867
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,443
The Special is... no more.

868
00:50:58,073 --> 00:51:01,457
Hello, everbody. Superman
Wonder Woman.

869
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,761
I had no idea you'd be here.

870
00:51:02,762 --> 00:51:06,270
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.
Greetings... ALL.

871
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,718
Welcome to my think-tank.

872
00:51:10,993 --> 00:51:13,276
All Master Builders you
captured over the years...

873
00:51:13,277 --> 00:51:17,052
You brought them here. -You are a
very perceptive person. Superman.

874
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:20,960
They've come up with all the instruction
for everything in the universe

875
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:23,645
- Robots.
- No, no!

876
00:51:28,773 --> 00:51:30,532
Can't get much worse than this.

877
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,820
Hello, neighbor! Oh no.

878
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:35,850
It's Green Lantern! Ohh
My Gosh, we're roomates.

879
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:37,378
How crazy is that.

880
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:40,212
Does anyone have some Kryptonite
there, they could give me?

881
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,858
Where is the Special?

882
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:46,543
The special and the piece of Resistance,
are at the bottom of the ocean.

883
00:51:46,544 --> 00:51:49,319
Are you telling you don't him?

884
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,013
Sir, my scuba teams
are looking for his remains

885
00:51:52,014 --> 00:51:53,317
as we speak.

886
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:57,043
Bad Cop he could still be alive.
The piece could still be out there.

887
00:51:57,044 --> 00:52:00,891
The only remnants of the Special
was a double-decker couch.

888
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:05,342
Wait, hold on, a double-decker
couch... Yes, sir.

889
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:09,281
Really? So its like a bunk-bed couch.
Is that what its like?

890
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:10,891
Thats weird.

891
00:52:10,892 --> 00:52:12,486
If you're sitting in the top middle

892
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:14,576
How you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?

893
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:17,532
If you're sitting on the bottom,
and you're watching TV.

894
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:20,362
Are you're gonna have to walk
rough a bunch of dangly legs.

895
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,154
Who gonna want to
sit at the bottom?

896
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:27,810
It's literally the most useless
idea I have ever heard.

897
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:35,915
Well, we're still alive. Yeeeah.
The Doubledecker couch.

898
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:39,913
It wasn't totally pointless after all.
Its the one thing that stayed together.

899
00:52:39,914 --> 00:52:43,709
I always believed in you, Emmett.
I don't want to spoil the party...

900
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,385
but does anyone else notice we're stuck in
the middle of the ocean, on this couch?

901
00:52:47,386 --> 00:52:52,163
I mean It's not like a big gigantic ship is just gonna
come out of nowhere and save us. My Gosh!

902
00:52:56,584 --> 00:52:59,771
Alas!..Matey's.

903
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:08,759
Metal beard I thought you said
we were a lost cause

904
00:53:08,783 --> 00:53:10,026
You are!

905
00:53:10,027 --> 00:53:15,590
Did you not hear me whole story
cicumscribing the folly of this whole enterprise?

906
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:17,963
That's kinda hard not to hear
when you're yelling everything.

907
00:53:17,964 --> 00:53:22,648
- So why did you come back?
- This be double land couch.

908
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,308
I watch Lord Business's forces
completely overlook it.

909
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:30,563
Which means we need more ideas like it.

910
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:32,841
- Thank you
- Ideas so dumb and bad.

911
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:36,586
That no one would ever think they could
possibly be useful.

912
00:53:37,485 --> 00:53:41,613
Oh Thank you.
So Special-what we do?

913
00:53:44,256 --> 00:53:45,558
Errr...

914
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:47,743
Well.

915
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:51,142
What's the last thing Lord Business

916
00:53:51,143 --> 00:53:53,154
expects Master Builders would do?

917
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:54,609
Build a Space-ship?
Kill-Chickens?

918
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,460
- Marshmallow.
- Why, this?

919
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:04,187
No!!...Its follow the instructions.

920
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:08,992
No! no! Listen wait. Listen.

921
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:14,251
Guys you all so talented,
and imagionative.

922
00:54:14,811 --> 00:54:18,175
But, you can't work together as a team.

923
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,593
I'm just a construction worker.

924
00:54:20,993 --> 00:54:22,866
But when I had a plan,

925
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:26,708
and we're all working together we
could build a skyscraper.

926
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:31,878
Now you are all master builders.

927
00:54:31,879 --> 00:54:36,139
Just Imagine what could happen
if you did that.

928
00:54:37,353 --> 00:54:39,353
You could save the universe.

929
00:54:39,935 --> 00:54:42,751
Well said, Emmet. Well said!!

930
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:46,659
Really? This be a fine speech there Laddy.

931
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:48,321
Okay.

932
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,544
Someone get me some markers.

933
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,864
Some construction paper.

934
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,628
And some giltter glue!

935
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:04,383
I call this:

936
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,999
Emmet's plan to get inside the tower.

937
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,830
Put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle

938
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:10,134
and save the world.

939
00:55:10,135 --> 00:55:12,904
I've built a hundreds just
like these back in the city.

940
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:15,734
If we could just get in there,  I'll know
where the air-ducts, and wiring are located

941
00:55:15,735 --> 00:55:17,037
I can get us anywhere.

942
00:55:17,038 --> 00:55:18,494
How will we get inside.

943
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:21,423
In a spaceships. Space-Ships!

944
00:55:21,424 --> 00:55:23,531
- Great idea. A Bat-spaceship.
- No.

945
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:26,188
They they are expecting us to
show up in a Bat-Spaceship..

946
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:28,463
Or Pirate-Spaceship or a
Rainbow-Sparkled-Spaceship

947
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:30,412
On of those sounds awesome to me.

948
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:35,472
My idea is to build a Spaceship, that's
exactly like all the other Octant deliveries Spaceships

949
00:55:35,473 --> 00:55:38,912
So now the special Spaceship I am
building for all of you all right now?

950
00:55:38,913 --> 00:55:40,631
Sorry Benny. Maybe next time.

951
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:43,559
You really let me oxygen out of my tank here

952
00:55:44,668 --> 00:55:47,040
Yeah, but according to your
precious instructions,

953
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,753
this ship needs a HyperDrive.

954
00:55:48,754 --> 00:55:51,130
We don't have that part
Maybe we could find one.

955
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:53,963
What do you think a Spaceships
gonna appear out of the blue.

956
00:55:53,988 --> 00:55:55,705
Are you kidding me,
the same thing?

957
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:02,971
Chewie, we're supposed to be
halfway to Naboo

958
00:56:02,972 --> 00:56:04,567
for a street party. Right now.

959
00:56:04,568 --> 00:56:08,477
This HyperDrive keeps malfunctioning,
taking us to losers system like this.

960
00:56:08,478 --> 00:56:12,454
Captain Solo, we must go, you know
how they get if we are not punctual.

961
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:15,696
The droids right. Lets roll.
Now hold on Hans

962
00:56:15,697 --> 00:56:18,498
This mightn't be the right galaxy
after all,

963
00:56:18,499 --> 00:56:20,911
because I see a heavenly body.

964
00:56:20,912 --> 00:56:24,732
Ohh well I have a boyfriend
and it is super serious. Right babe?

965
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,288
Of course it's serious

966
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:28,628
- Got room for just one dude?
- Woah, Babe.

967
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:30,898
If it's a cool dude like you.

968
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:33,181
You're trying to bail on us?
I'm not trying to bail.

969
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,324
You're asking if you could go
with them on their party.

970
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,627
<i>That thing is fill wth...</i>

971
00:56:36,628 --> 00:56:38,590
You speak french now? Babe, look

972
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:40,887
if this relationship ever going to work between us

973
00:56:40,888 --> 00:56:43,562
I need to feel free to party
with a bunch of strangers,

974
00:56:43,563 --> 00:56:44,864
whenever I feel like it

975
00:56:44,865 --> 00:56:49,522
- What? Babe.
- I will text you.

976
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:52,466
Where you'd get that sweet
space cape, brother?

977
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:55,923
<i>Party time!</i>

978
00:56:56,894 --> 00:56:58,283
Babe?

979
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:09,031
Wild-Style...

980
00:57:09,032 --> 00:57:13,738
You're such an amazing person, and you
know if Batman can't see that then.

981
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:17,456
He's just, He's just as blind..as
a.

982
00:57:17,457 --> 00:57:21,979
A guy who's eyes stopped working.

983
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:27,468
And let me tell you something, Batman
is the worst person I've ever met.

984
00:57:27,469 --> 00:57:30,928
- Need a HyperDrive?
- No way!!

985
00:57:30,929 --> 00:57:32,903
- I knew it! I knew that
- You really had me there!

986
00:57:32,904 --> 00:57:34,205
Those guys are so lame

987
00:57:34,206 --> 00:57:35,883
all I did was play space checkers.

988
00:57:35,884 --> 00:57:39,219
Plus it turned out the hairy one dude
and the metal one to.

989
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,994
All dudes. But wont they notice their
hyperdrive is missing?

990
00:57:41,995 --> 00:57:45,491
Come on, Chewie.
Hit the HyperDrive.

991
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,100
Nahh They'll be fine.

992
00:57:49,611 --> 00:57:51,221
LET'S MAKE A SPACESHIP!

993
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:57,606
Step 1: Alright we need a
red 4 piece unit over at the..

994
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:01,184
Uni-Kitty, you're suppose to follow
the instructions, remember?

995
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:02,486
Sorry!

996
00:58:02,487 --> 00:58:06,474
This That gives me the goosebumps!
What do I even? I can't!

997
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:09,801
Nice.

998
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:11,508
Step 2:

999
00:58:11,509 --> 00:58:14,919
We piloted the ship to the service entrance
so we can get pass to the dangerous

1000
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,419
but also kinda cool laser gate.

1001
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:21,040
Space-ID? I have a drive on.

1002
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:24,211
Who are you here to see
I'm here to see your butt.

1003
00:58:24,212 --> 00:58:27,824
Is that the last name BUTT
or first name Your an...

1004
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:38,857
First try.

1005
00:58:39,413 --> 00:58:42,608
<i>Step 3:
We break into Lord Business's office</i>

1006
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:45,552
and we'll plunder his collection
of relics for disguises

1007
00:58:46,367 --> 00:58:50,569
Step 4: Benny and Metal beard sneak their
way into the master control room.

1008
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:53,824
Motion Sensors triggered
in sector 12. 10-4

1009
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:02,472
Are you thinking what I'm thinking,
Ohhh.

1010
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:04,623
Ohhhh.

1011
00:59:07,472 --> 00:59:10,849
Metal-Beard, that was awesome.
First law of the sea.

1012
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:13,925
Never place your rear
end on a pirates face.

1013
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:16,678
Once inside they'll use their
technical knowhow.

1014
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:17,984
To disable the Kragle sheild.

1015
00:59:17,985 --> 00:59:21,848
I am a computer.
Cool talking computer!

1016
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:26,437
Please disable the shield systems.
Of course

1017
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:29,628
There are no movies in
your area with that title

1018
00:59:30,093 --> 00:59:33,880
Step 5: Vitruvius will provide look-out,
to make sure we're not being followed.

1019
00:59:33,881 --> 00:59:36,198
OK. Step-6:

1020
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:38,481
Batman and Uni-kitty
go into the boardroom

1021
00:59:38,482 --> 00:59:40,916
to make one last change
to Lord Business's plan.

1022
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:44,009
I move that we freeze the universe.
Can I get a second on that

1023
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:47,560
I second. Bruce Wayne,
C.E.O of Wayne Enterprises.

1024
00:59:47,561 --> 00:59:52,500
Bruce Wayne? Who's that?
Sounds like a cool guy.

1025
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,834
We'd like to invest in your company.
Your weapon to

1026
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,152
control the unverse, sounds
super-sweet, I must say.

1027
00:59:59,153 --> 01:00:04,066
It is. Indeed super-sweet. Cool!
What kind of sound system? Does it have.

1028
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:08,326
Sound System? Well I mean we have an iPod
Shuffle -Wait a second.

1029
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:10,303
Your telling me you have a machine
to control the universe

1030
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:12,382
and you can't listen to tunes in surround
sound.

1031
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:14,980
Embarrassing. Well we - We...

1032
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:17,310
We need to get that done.
I want 8 foot speakers.

1033
01:00:17,311 --> 01:00:19,268
Great call. Yeh
I want speakers...

1034
01:00:19,269 --> 01:00:21,793
That you can hug
with his arms and your legs

1035
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,415
and just feel the beat.

1036
01:00:24,117 --> 01:00:27,951
Listen up we need new instruction
for bigger system for TACO.

1037
01:00:27,952 --> 01:00:30,772
We will never help...Whatever you said boss

1038
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,784
Then once the instructions,
are printed.

1039
01:00:32,785 --> 01:00:35,003
Wild-Style and I will enter
the Kragle room.

1040
01:00:35,304 --> 01:00:38,699
Place the thing on the other thing,
and save the universe.

1041
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:41,789
I didn't draw that.
Is that me exploding?

1042
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:43,738
I didn't mention that earlier

1043
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:46,716
when you re-unite the piece with
the Kragle it might explode?

1044
01:00:46,717 --> 01:00:48,943
No. But might not, right?

1045
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:52,599
Sure, sure, sure.
Let's go with that.

1046
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:55,778
Attention everybody, incoming
speaker delivery

1047
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:09,339
Who are you two?
We are transfers from downstairs.

1048
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,664
What? Excuse me?

1049
01:01:10,665 --> 01:01:13,624
Your robot voice, sounds a
awful lot like a human voice.

1050
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,953
Give me a break.
I've never built a robot before.

1051
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:17,915
What do you mean? You
have always been a robot.

1052
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:20,055
No. No. No. Do not listen to her.

1053
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:22,299
What are your robot
serial numbers?

1054
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:30,894
Everything is Awesome.

1055
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:34,823
No way this is my jam.
This is also my jam.

1056
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,731
Everything is Awesome.

1057
01:01:36,732 --> 01:01:39,348
Everything is good
When you're part of the team.

1058
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:42,027
Sing. I do not want to sing this song.

1059
01:01:42,028 --> 01:01:44,284
Everything is awesome.

1060
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:48,140
Everything is cool
When you're part of the team.

1061
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:53,707
Everything is awesome
when you're part of the team.

1062
01:01:54,118 --> 01:01:55,622
Quick, let's go.

1063
01:01:56,962 --> 01:01:58,772
I thought you like that song.

1064
01:01:58,773 --> 01:02:00,249
I don't

1065
01:02:02,821 --> 01:02:04,705
I don't want to put this
tough act but I don't

1066
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:06,508
think you're as mean as
you're trying to say

1067
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:09,247
ME? I'm not mean. What are you talking
about? Just saying you were all

1068
01:02:09,248 --> 01:02:12,260
He is not special.
He can't possibly be Special.

1069
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,509
This guy? Are you kidding?

1070
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:19,131
I don't think thats you.
The real you anyway.

1071
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:29,052
Look, Emmet ...I

1072
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,899
I wanted it to be me, ok

1073
01:02:33,894 --> 01:02:35,806
I wanted to be the special.

1074
01:02:36,276 --> 01:02:39,614
and I know that sounds super
mature, it's just...

1075
01:02:40,115 --> 01:02:44,023
Ever since I heard the prophecy,
I wanted to be the one.

1076
01:02:44,405 --> 01:02:47,446
I was right there
in that construction site...

1077
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:49,571
right on top of it, and then...

1078
01:02:51,097 --> 01:02:52,737
It turn out to be you.

1079
01:02:59,111 --> 01:03:02,305
That night in the city when you thought
that I was the special...

1080
01:03:05,466 --> 01:03:09,149
when you said I was
talented and important.

1081
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:12,749
That was the first time
anyone had ever told me that.

1082
01:03:14,033 --> 01:03:16,353
It made me want to do everything
I could, to be the guy, ,,

1083
01:03:16,354 --> 01:03:18,575
you were talking about.

1084
01:03:21,818 --> 01:03:24,124
Lucy. What?

1085
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:29,087
That was my real name.
You asked earlier, and its...

1086
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:31,391
Lucy.

1087
01:03:34,905 --> 01:03:36,209
I really like that name.

1088
01:03:40,488 --> 01:03:42,814
Hey what are you two losers tallking about?

1089
01:03:42,815 --> 01:03:44,646
Oh nothing. Thought I'll help you guys.

1090
01:03:44,647 --> 01:03:46,687
Let the weird cat thing to stall

1091
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:50,268
Business, Business, business.
Numbers. Is this working?

1092
01:03:50,269 --> 01:03:52,023
Yes! Yay.

1093
01:03:52,024 --> 01:03:53,325
There's Bad Cop.

1094
01:03:57,067 --> 01:04:00,496
Okay, wait for my signal.
Good luck, Emmet.

1095
01:04:00,977 --> 01:04:05,358
Lucy... I think this might
be goodbye.

1096
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,195
I don't like goodbyes.
Let's just call this:

1097
01:04:08,852 --> 01:04:11,562
"See you later, alligator."

1098
01:04:11,563 --> 01:04:13,958
"See you later, alligator"?

1099
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:17,676
After a while, crocodile.

1100
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,422
Who's Lucy?

1101
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:25,893
Batman, when we get inside the room
there'll be audio sensors everywhere.

1102
01:04:25,894 --> 01:04:27,731
We have to be really really quiet

1103
01:04:27,732 --> 01:04:30,954
Don't worry dad I read your
dumb instructions. Stop yelling at me.

1104
01:04:30,955 --> 01:04:32,685
Benny, What's the status with the shield?

1105
01:04:32,686 --> 01:04:36,446
Yeah it's going great.
If somebody were to listen to me

1106
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:39,032
Downloading the latest episode
"Where are my pants?"

1107
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:41,600
<i>What are you talking about?
You know what I want.</i>

1108
01:04:43,681 --> 01:04:44,983
Bad cop.

1109
01:04:44,984 --> 01:04:46,928
<i> Hi this is
Lord Business's assistance, </i>

1110
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:49,110
<i>he would like you to come
to his office immediately.</i>

1111
01:04:49,111 --> 01:04:51,354
I'll be there thanks. You're welcome sir

1112
01:04:54,962 --> 01:04:56,523
Hey who is that?

1113
01:04:59,616 --> 01:05:02,462
Thats the signal, but
the shield is still up.

1114
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,906
We'll wing it.

1115
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,545
Its a Bat punt.

1116
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:13,401
Benny, disable the shield.
Disable the shield. Now.

1117
01:05:13,402 --> 01:05:16,390
<i>Disable the shield!
Searching for Albanian restaurant.</i>

1118
01:05:16,391 --> 01:05:19,981
<i>No! I never once said anything!
I do not understand what you mean.</i>

1119
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,827
- Disable the shield!
- Benny, what's going on?

1120
01:05:22,828 --> 01:05:24,457
<i>Disable the shield. Come on</i>

1121
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:28,364
<i> You are undermining me.
Which phrase would like me to undermine?</i>

1122
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:30,721
Disable the shield. Let me try.

1123
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:34,935
Be he disabling of yon shield.

1124
01:05:34,936 --> 01:05:37,009
Disabling shield. What?

1125
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:43,067
Okay. In three.

1126
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:46,196
Two.

1127
01:05:47,285 --> 01:05:48,617
One.

1128
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,408
Lets do this.

1129
01:05:52,496 --> 01:05:53,945
Lucy!

1130
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,859
Lucy! No!

1131
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:03,315
Oh man

1132
01:06:05,832 --> 01:06:09,133
Sneaking around the corner.

1133
01:06:10,947 --> 01:06:16,104
Vitruvius, I see you've accidently
wandered into my Think-tank.

1134
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,839
And by the way, I found
a few of your friends.

1135
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,777
I wish -I mean, all of them.
Sorry!!

1136
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:24,537
Acceptable work Bad Cop
Thank you, sir.

1137
01:06:24,538 --> 01:06:27,391
Robots, destroy this old man
at once.

1138
01:06:27,392 --> 01:06:30,524
Did -You just call me old?
Yeah, so what?

1139
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:34,723
Well Junebug I really prefer
the word "experienced".

1140
01:06:52,046 --> 01:06:53,348
You see, Emmet?

1141
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:57,203
A corrupted spirit is no match
for the purity of imagination...

1142
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:02,857
Vitruvius! No!

1143
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:10,003
Vitruvius. My sweet Emmet, come closer.

1144
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:13,443
You must know something
about the prophecy.

1145
01:07:13,444 --> 01:07:15,709
I know, I'm doing
the best, but...

1146
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:17,539
The prophecy...

1147
01:07:18,276 --> 01:07:20,970
I made it up. What?

1148
01:07:21,556 --> 01:07:24,613
I made it up. It's not true.

1149
01:07:25,106 --> 01:07:28,664
That means I'm just...
I'm not the special?

1150
01:07:28,988 --> 01:07:30,378
You must listen.

1151
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,561
What I'm about to tell you,

1152
01:07:32,562 --> 01:07:35,429
will change the course
of history.

1153
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,294
No.

1154
01:07:51,783 --> 01:07:55,386
Hey, not so special anymore, huh?

1155
01:07:57,367 --> 01:08:00,899
Look guess what? No one ever
told me I was special.

1156
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,262
I never got a trophy
just for showing up.

1157
01:08:04,263 --> 01:08:08,991
I'm not some special little
Snowflake... No!!

1158
01:08:09,342 --> 01:08:11,709
But as unspecial as I am...

1159
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:16,615
you are a thousand billion times
more unspecial than me.

1160
01:08:16,616 --> 01:08:20,058
Robots bring me the sword
of exact zero.

1161
01:08:20,059 --> 01:08:23,783
Yes, Lord Business.
It must be weird.

1162
01:08:23,784 --> 01:08:27,446
One minute your the most special
person in the universe.

1163
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,874
The next minute you're nobody.

1164
01:08:32,582 --> 01:08:36,022
Ohh I have a nice spot for
this, in my relics room.

1165
01:08:37,093 --> 01:08:39,875
Ohh ho my mistake. There it goes.

1166
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:41,425
No!

1167
01:08:41,426 --> 01:08:43,287
Bye-bye forever.

1168
01:08:43,288 --> 01:08:47,568
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

1169
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,224
Release the Kragle.

1170
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:53,900
<i>Computer? Yes, sir.</i>

1171
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:56,409
Set the electric shocker
to 100 Mississipis.

1172
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:57,610
<i>No problems.</i>

1173
01:08:57,611 --> 01:08:59,934
And terminate everyone, already on it

1174
01:09:00,235 --> 01:09:04,207
Emmet, that should give you enough time to
witness the first location to be Kragled.

1175
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:05,946
Your hometown. No!

1176
01:09:06,047 --> 01:09:08,837
Bad Cop, we may have to leave
you here to die.

1177
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:11,623
What? Sir? It's not personal.

1178
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:16,332
It's just business.
Lord Business.

1179
01:09:16,962 --> 01:09:18,285
Ciao.

1180
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:24,062
<i>Begin zaping termination in
99 Mississipis.</i>

1181
01:09:24,063 --> 01:09:27,932
<i>98 Mississipis. 97 Mississipis.</i>

1182
01:09:27,933 --> 01:09:29,832
<i>And so on...</i>

1183
01:09:48,961 --> 01:09:53,803
<i>Attention everyone.
This is President Business.</i>

1184
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:58,586
<i>Hello, welcome to Taco Tuesday.</i>

1185
01:09:58,587 --> 01:10:03,806
Don't worry about this big
black balloon blocking the sun.

1186
01:10:03,807 --> 01:10:05,994
What you need to worry about
is this question.

1187
01:10:05,995 --> 01:10:08,358
I'm about to ask you.

1188
01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:10,779
Who wants a taco?

1189
01:10:14,284 --> 01:10:16,553
Taco! Taco! Go crazy

1190
01:10:18,037 --> 01:10:22,076
Alright everyone. Act normal.

1191
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,100
Perfect

1192
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:27,737
Now, everybody says "freeze".

1193
01:10:30,545 --> 01:10:34,129
So, I guess running around
and screaming, is normal.

1194
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,619
Micromanagers,
commence micromanagement.

1195
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,139
Commencing micromanagement.

1196
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:48,594
Please. Please...
Won't somebody help us

1197
01:10:48,595 --> 01:10:51,117
Emmet you'll think
of something, right?

1198
01:10:51,118 --> 01:10:52,515
Like you always do.

1199
01:10:53,765 --> 01:10:55,453
Didn't you hear him.

1200
01:10:55,454 --> 01:10:57,201
The Prophecy's made up.

1201
01:10:58,305 --> 01:11:00,014
I'm not the special.

1202
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:03,697
To think for a moment I might be.

1203
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,683
<i>Emmet... Who said that?</i>

1204
01:11:08,684 --> 01:11:12,792
I did
I am the ghost of Vitruvius.

1205
01:11:16,393 --> 01:11:20,717
Emmet, you didn't let me finish
earlier, because I died ..

1206
01:11:20,718 --> 01:11:22,896
The reason I made up the prophecy.

1207
01:11:22,897 --> 01:11:27,396
Was because I knew that whoever
found the piece, could become the special.

1208
01:11:27,397 --> 01:11:30,118
Because the only thing
anyone needs to be special.

1209
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,392
Is to believe, that you can be.

1210
01:11:33,093 --> 01:11:36,924
I know it sounds like a
cat-poster but it's true

1211
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:40,788
Look at what you did, when
you believed you were special.

1212
01:11:41,204 --> 01:11:43,829
You Just need to believe it
some more.

1213
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:47,014
How can I just decide to
believe, that I'm special.

1214
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:48,447
When I'm not.

1215
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:52,178
Because the world depends on it.

1216
01:11:57,437 --> 01:12:01,434
<i>- Zapping termination in 35 mississipis.
- What ?</i>

1217
01:12:01,435 --> 01:12:05,246
<i>34, 33...</i>

1218
01:12:05,247 --> 01:12:09,253
<i>32, 31...</i>

1219
01:12:09,254 --> 01:12:13,218

01:12:17,305 --> 01:12:21,343
<i>26, 25...</i>

1222
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:33,445
Emmet, what are you...

1223
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:41,299
Lucy... Wait, what do you...

1224
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,231
Now it's your turn
to be the hero.

1225
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:45,209
Nooo!

1226
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:49,883
See you later-alligator. Don't!

1227
01:12:51,555 --> 01:12:53,948
No Emmet!

1228
01:12:56,032 --> 01:12:58,038
<i>6...</i>

1229
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:01,727
<i>5, 4...</i>

1230
01:13:01,728 --> 01:13:05,406

01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,178
<i>1, 0... Error.</i>

<i>Termination Failure.</i>

1233
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,246
Emmet...

1234
01:13:28,706 --> 01:13:30,255
He saved us.

1235
01:13:31,404 --> 01:13:35,037
What do we do now? There's gotta
be a bright sight here somewhere

1236
01:13:35,038 --> 01:13:36,844
Does anyone have any ideas?

1237
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:39,628
Emmet had ideas.

1238
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:44,001
Arrr if only there were more people
in the world like he.

1239
01:13:48,087 --> 01:13:49,533
Maybe there are.

1240
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,813
Meet me downstairs in
10 seconds.

1241
01:13:51,814 --> 01:13:53,446
AFTER 10 SECONDS

1242
01:13:53,447 --> 01:13:57,681
<i>Honey, where are my pants?</i>

1243
01:13:58,663 --> 01:14:01,273
Hey guess what found your pants. Series is over.

1244
01:14:01,274 --> 01:14:04,532
Benny, send this out to everyone in the universe.

1245
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:08,063
1980's something technology,
Now your talking.

1246
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:13,947
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

1247
01:14:13,948 --> 01:14:15,949
You don't know me,
but I'm on TV,

1248
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:17,701
<i>So you can trust me.</i>

1249
01:14:17,702 --> 01:14:20,247
I know things seem kinda bad right now.

1250
01:14:20,849 --> 01:14:23,065
But there is a way out of this.

1251
01:14:23,982 --> 01:14:28,089
This is Emmet. And he was
just like all of you.

1252
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,949
An face in the crowd followed
the same instructions as you.

1253
01:14:32,721 --> 01:14:35,605
He was so good at fitting in,
no one ever saw him

1254
01:14:36,025 --> 01:14:37,805
And I owe you an apology.

1255
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:40,465
Because I used to look
down on people like that.

1256
01:14:40,466 --> 01:14:43,555
"I used to think they were
followers"

1257
01:14:43,556 --> 01:14:46,474
"with no ideas or any vision.."

1258
01:14:46,475 --> 01:14:48,874
<i> Because it turns out Emmet <i>
had great ideas.</i></i>

1259
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:53,114
<i>And even they seemed weird,
and kinda pointless</i>

1260
01:14:53,115 --> 01:14:57,618
<i> they actually came closer than anyone
else to save the universe. </i>

1261
01:14:58,063 --> 01:15:01,075
<i>And now we have to finish
what he started,</i>

1262
01:15:01,076 --> 01:15:04,678
 <i> By making whatever weird
things pop into our heads </i>

1263
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,092
<i> All of you have the ability inside
of you to become a ground breaker </i>

1264
01:15:08,093 --> 01:15:10,995
<i> and I mean literally
break the ground </i>

1265
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:13,649
<i>Clear up the pices, clear apart your walls</i>

1266
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:17,251
<i>Build things only you can build,
defend yourselves.</i>

1267
01:15:17,252 --> 01:15:21,995
<i>We need to fight back against
President Business's plan to freeze us.</i>

1268
01:15:22,472 --> 01:15:25,336
<i> Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday</i>

1269
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:29,425
<i>It will be known as freedom friday.</i>

1270
01:15:31,374 --> 01:15:33,957
But still on a Tuesday!

1271
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:41,636
End of the line.

1272
01:15:43,895 --> 01:15:45,298
Bad Cop?

1273
01:15:45,299 --> 01:15:47,379
I hope there's still a good cop
in me somewhere else.

1274
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,307
I'll hold these guys up.
You go stop em yeyy!

1275
01:15:53,599 --> 01:15:56,293
Great idea,
but how will we get there?

1276
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:04,305
I could...

1277
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:08,901
I could build. I could build a spaceship.

1278
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:14,617
Your not gonna say no? Build away!
Whatever your name is.

1279
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,510
Spaceship!

1280
01:16:23,726 --> 01:16:25,117
Spaceship!

1281
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:29,715
Spaceship. Spaceship!

1282
01:16:29,716 --> 01:16:33,230
Spaceship!

1283
01:16:33,231 --> 01:16:35,178
All units, attacking that Spaceship.

1284
01:16:36,574 --> 01:16:37,876
Spaceship!

1285
01:16:38,764 --> 01:16:41,071
Where did he go? Space-Ship!

1286
01:16:43,624 --> 01:16:46,809
Wild-Style, look! It's the citizens.

1287
01:16:52,314 --> 01:16:53,656
Tally hoe

1288
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:56,137
And the Old West.

1289
01:16:56,659 --> 01:16:58,776
And don't forget us Master Builders.

1290
01:16:58,777 --> 01:17:00,768
What is going on?

1291
01:17:00,769 --> 01:17:05,184
You stop building! Just stop it!

1292
01:17:09,214 --> 01:17:11,276
Great job. This might actually work.

1293
01:17:11,277 --> 01:17:15,218
It was your speech with
rouse this hearty crew

1294
01:17:15,219 --> 01:17:17,557
If only Emmet we here to see this

1295
01:17:17,558 --> 01:17:19,711
He'd say something adorable like...

1296
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:31,564
<i>Forever.</i>

1297
01:17:42,883 --> 01:17:45,337
It is another vision?

1298
01:17:47,235 --> 01:17:48,688
Where am I?

1299
01:17:49,525 --> 01:17:52,535
Is that the Office tower?

1300
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,030
What was that?

1301
01:18:04,245 --> 01:18:08,242
No.

1302
01:18:09,343 --> 01:18:11,539
The spaceship!

1303
01:18:12,316 --> 01:18:14,177
What in the world is that?

1304
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,341
It's adorable.

1305
01:18:20,894 --> 01:18:21,394
Oh Ohh.

1306
01:18:22,255 --> 01:18:24,408
No! No!

1307
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:27,877
Don't eat me!, Do not eat me
Do not eat me. Please!!

1308
01:18:27,878 --> 01:18:29,381
Hi, Emmet.

1309
01:18:31,536 --> 01:18:32,847
Hi?

1310
01:18:36,117 --> 01:18:37,655
Is this?

1311
01:18:38,267 --> 01:18:39,621
The man...

1312
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:47,480
The man upstairs.

1313
01:18:55,234 --> 01:18:56,537
What happened?

1314
01:18:57,575 --> 01:19:00,068
No, no. This is a disaster.

1315
01:19:00,714 --> 01:19:03,602
Why... What?

1316
01:19:03,603 --> 01:19:05,004
What?

1317
01:19:05,005 --> 01:19:09,482
Why a dragon on top of the development?

1318
01:19:09,483 --> 01:19:12,512
I was just playing.
I know it's hard to understand,

1319
01:19:12,513 --> 01:19:14,603
but this is dads stuff OK?

1320
01:19:14,604 --> 01:19:19,319
All of this that you see before you
is all your fathers.

1321
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,786
And everything is thought out...

1322
01:19:21,787 --> 01:19:26,643
- What did you do down here? Did you the top off of the tower?
- It was an accident.

1323
01:19:26,644 --> 01:19:29,009
You accidentally.

1324
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:34,362
Expertly, carefully took the
entire top off of the tower?

1325
01:19:34,363 --> 01:19:36,250
- Yes.
- You know the rules.

1326
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:39,448
You know the rules this is not a toy.
I kind of is... NO!!

1327
01:19:39,449 --> 01:19:44,185
Actually its a highly sophisticated
interlocking brick system.

1328
01:19:44,186 --> 01:19:45,939
But we bought it at the toy store.

1329
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:49,857
We did but the way I'm using it
makes it an adult thing.

1330
01:19:49,858 --> 01:19:52,281
The box says that is for 8-14

1331
01:19:52,282 --> 01:19:56,229
Thats a suggestion.
They have to put that on there.

1332
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:59,685
You can't expect me to be able
to resist playing with all this?

1333
01:19:59,686 --> 01:20:02,602
Look move your stuff over to
the Christmas decorations.

1334
01:20:02,603 --> 01:20:05,344
All those bricks, you
can build anything you want.

1335
01:20:08,422 --> 01:20:10,968
Finn, we gonna play a little game.

1336
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:14,807
It's called: "let's put everything
back the way you found it."

1337
01:20:14,808 --> 01:20:16,772
But Dad, you don't understand.

1338
01:20:16,773 --> 01:20:20,059
So I can make things the way they're
supposed to be..

1339
01:20:22,983 --> 01:20:24,285
Permanently.

1340
01:20:27,444 --> 01:20:28,928
More Kragle?

1341
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:31,937
This rebellion ends right right now!

1342
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:41,842
Oh . No! Stop.

1343
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:47,862
Fire in the hole.

1344
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:54,785
Wait, what is happening?
We're going down

1345
01:20:54,786 --> 01:20:56,088
Mayday! Stop!

1346
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:02,170
Hold on, We're coming for ya!

1347
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:05,704
Stop. oh no.

1348
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:17,112
Too Many micromanagers.

1349
01:21:17,113 --> 01:21:18,628
What am I holding here?

1350
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:21,621
It's a battle ship. No, its a
hodge podge that's what it is.

1351
01:21:21,622 --> 01:21:25,068
Whats Batman on it?
What is this a robot pirate?

1352
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,984
Stop it!, No stop it. Stop!

1353
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:32,077
I thought I glued over
the constructor worker.

1354
01:21:33,168 --> 01:21:35,296
Here, give that to me.

1355
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:37,880
Stop it!

1356
01:21:37,881 --> 01:21:40,225
<i>All those were my friends, stop it.</i>

1357
01:21:40,226 --> 01:21:43,994
We were a hearty crew but it be

1358
01:21:43,995 --> 01:21:45,601
It be over.

1359
01:21:46,225 --> 01:21:47,675
No!

1360
01:21:50,201 --> 01:21:53,965
A Piece of Resistance.
I can still save them.

1361
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:57,376
Let's get this..off this
construction worker

1362
01:21:57,377 --> 01:22:00,451
He's not just a construction worker dad
He's a hero.

1363
01:22:00,452 --> 01:22:01,884
Nope he's not.

1364
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:06,896
He is a ordinary, regular,
generic construction worker.

1365
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:09,295
And I need to put him
back, where he belongs

1366
01:22:10,872 --> 01:22:13,762
Now where is my exacto knife.

1367
01:22:16,429 --> 01:22:18,630
I gotta get the piece of resistance.

1368
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:22,900
If I could get the attention
of the smaller creature...

1369
01:22:23,636 --> 01:22:24,938
I gotta move.

1370
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:26,993
Where is that?

1371
01:22:37,628 --> 01:22:38,977
Alright...

1372
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,628
- Dad?
- Yes.

1373
01:23:17,629 --> 01:23:20,818
I think I saw the exact in little Zealand.

1374
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:23,347
Ohh-Great. Thank you.
You're welcome.

1375
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,191
It up to you now, Emmet.

1376
01:23:36,766 --> 01:23:39,019
BELIEVE

1377
01:23:42,473 --> 01:23:44,199
<i>Believe</i>

1378
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:49,654
I know it sound like a cat-poster,
but its true.

1379
01:24:11,721 --> 01:24:13,204
Sorry, street.

1380
01:24:25,044 --> 01:24:28,268
I can see everything!

1381
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:33,964
What the heck is this?

1382
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:36,836
I am a Master builder.

1383
01:24:38,712 --> 01:24:41,841
Release every micromanager
we have.

1384
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:43,556
Let's get him, fellas

1385
01:24:47,328 --> 01:24:48,629

1386
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:51,086

1392
01:25:18,173 --> 01:25:19,476
Emmet!

1393
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,491
Think positive.

1394
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:25,962
Help me.

1395
01:25:26,818 --> 01:25:29,750
Stay positive. Come on.

1396
01:25:30,344 --> 01:25:31,646
Forget it!

1397
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:40,708
You all need to be more friendly!

1398
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:45,320
Emmet! Go! Now your chance

1399
01:25:45,321 --> 01:25:48,101

Lord Business.
Back from the dead Bruchowsky?

1403
01:26:03,076 --> 01:26:05,931
Well you're too late.
Esqueletrons, get him.

1404
01:26:17,266 --> 01:26:18,235
Can't move

1405
01:26:19,546 --> 01:26:22,446
See your friends?
They are finished.

1406
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:25,150
My world is almost finished.

1407
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:29,328
The last thing I need to do,
is finish you.

1408
01:26:29,329 --> 01:26:33,664
No stop please, if you do one more thing
I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.

1409
01:26:33,665 --> 01:26:36,740
- Your secret weapon?
- Yes.

1410
01:26:36,741 --> 01:26:40,578
It is called
The Power of the Special.

1411
01:26:40,579 --> 01:26:42,382
That sounds dumb.

1412
01:26:42,383 --> 01:26:44,856
Alright? Here it comes.

1413
01:26:44,857 --> 01:26:48,389
My secret weapon Is this.

1414
01:26:49,528 --> 01:26:52,453
What is that? Is it super small,
I don't see anything.

1415
01:26:52,454 --> 01:26:54,941
Its my hand.
I like you to take it.

1416
01:26:54,942 --> 01:26:59,001
You want to take your hand off?
No, I want you to join me.

1417
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:02,610
Look at all these things that people built.

1418
01:27:03,029 --> 01:27:04,562
You might see a mess.

1419
01:27:04,563 --> 01:27:10,126
Exactly. And a bunch of weird dorky stuff
that ruined my perfectly good stuff.

1420
01:27:10,456 --> 01:27:12,921
Okay, what I see.

1421
01:27:12,922 --> 01:27:16,446
Are people, inspired by each
other

1422
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:18,165
and by you...

1423
01:27:19,042 --> 01:27:22,046
People taking what you made.

1424
01:27:22,047 --> 01:27:24,473
And making something new out of it.

1425
01:27:40,828 --> 01:27:42,860
Finn, did you make all of this?

1426
01:27:45,546 --> 01:27:48,333
Well I tried stop President Business,

1427
01:27:48,334 --> 01:27:50,066
from using the Kragle.

1428
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,483
What's the Kragle.

1429
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,697
Its in there.

1430
01:27:58,101 --> 01:27:59,404
This?

1431
01:28:25,593 --> 01:28:27,945
OFF LIMITS

1432

So...

1435
01:28:39,053 --> 01:28:41,314
President Business
is the bad guy?

1436
01:28:49,244 --> 01:28:50,549
If...

1437
01:28:51,883 --> 01:28:54,281
The construction guy.

1438
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:57,799
Said something to President Business...

1439
01:29:01,164 --> 01:29:02,554
What would he say?

1440
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:14,539
You don't have to be.

1441
01:29:15,432 --> 01:29:16,901
The bad guy.

1442
01:29:19,352 --> 01:29:22,651
You are the most talented,

1443
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:25,162

And so am I.

1448
01:29:46,709 --> 01:29:48,268
<i>And so is everyone.</i>

1449
01:29:49,815 --> 01:29:52,128
<i>The prophecy is made up.</i>

1450
01:29:52,662 --> 01:29:54,371
<i>But it's also true.</i>

1451
01:29:55,113 --> 01:29:56,853
<i>It's about all of us.</i>

1452
01:29:57,231 --> 01:29:59,760

01:30:32,949 --> 01:30:34,682
We got a hugger.

1456
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:38,735
Be Careful.

1457
01:30:38,736 --> 01:30:42,051

1458
01:30:55,077 --> 01:30:57,888

1459
01:30:57,889 --> 01:31:00,959
