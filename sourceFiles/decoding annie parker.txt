1
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,063
- Excuse me, Dr. King?
- I'm sorry.

2
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,399
I don't have any more time.
I'm already late for my plane.

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,867
My name's Annie Parker.

4
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,773
Oh.

5
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:43,143
I read your letters.

6
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,612
I heard you were in town.

7
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:49,149
I tried to catch your lecture,
but... the traffic was horrible.

8
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,117
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

9
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,787
It was a bit dry. My jokes
didn't play very well.

10
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,226
- That's a pretty necklace.
- Thank you.

11
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,696
It was my mom's. I had
it restrung recently.

12
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,333
- You know, she...
- Hey, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:11,804
I really do have to go. I hope we
can speak again. All the best.

14
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:36,628
Oh, you might feel some
discomfort. Just relax.

15
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,910
<i>There are great mysteries out there.</i>

16
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:54,080
<i>Strange and magical,</i>

17
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,782
<i>hidden in codes.</i>

18
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,920
<i>Did you ever wonder...</i>

19
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:05,525
<i>if you knew those codes,
could you change your future?</i>

20
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,779
- Slap.
- Snap.

21
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,617
<i>That's my big sister Joan
and I. She knew things.</i>

22
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:34,020
That's where Death hides
when he comes to the house.

23
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,122
He sleeps most of the time.

24
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:40,726
But you should be very quiet when
you're up here so you don't wake him up.

25
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,265
Did Mommy wake him up?

26
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,367
Yes, she did.

27
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,208
She blew it, and now we
don't have a mommy anymore.

28
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,349
And he'll get us too
if we're not careful,

29
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,883
like he did Grandma and Aunt Lil.

30
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,291
- Snap.
- Snap.

31
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,926
<i>And this is my story.</i>

32
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,440
<i>Some girls love to run around</i>

33
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:31,277
<i>Like to handle everything they see</i>

34
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:35,081
<i>But my girl has more fun around</i>

35
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,518
<i>And you know she'd rather be with me</i>

36
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>Me-oh my</i>

37
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:44,124
<i>Lucky guy is what I am</i>

38
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,061
<i>Tell you why you'll understand</i>

39
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:53,231
<i>She don't fly although she can</i>

40
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,171
<i>Some boys like to run around</i>

41
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:02,008
<i>They don't think about
the things they do</i>

42
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,778
<i>But this boy wants to settle down</i>

43
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,549
<i>And you know he'd rather be with you</i>

44
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,319
<i>Me-oh my, lucky guy
is what I am...</i>

45
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,657
<i>That's me, not as
confident as I should be,</i>

46
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,427
<i>so I would make up for it
by making bad choices.</i>

47
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,796
<i>That's my sister Joan all grown up.</i>

48
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,502
<i>And that's Joan's best friend Louise, who
my dad said was trouble with a capital T,</i>

49
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,939
<i>which made Joan, who was always
good, like her even more.</i>

50
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,408
<i>That's Paul, who was
sweet and funny.</i>

51
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:39,212
<i>We fell in love and got
engaged when I was only 18...</i>

52
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,182
<i>always a good idea...
and later got married</i>

53
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:44,817
<i>because he was sweet but also
because he had a great ass</i>

54
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,187
<i>which was like a piece
of pneumatic machinery.</i>

55
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:51,891
<i>Thumpity thumpity thumpity thump.
Thumpity thumpity thump.</i>

56
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,427
<i>He was going to be a
musician, which is hard,</i>

57
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,364
<i>so until then, he was working
as a pool cleaner...</i>

58
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,733
<i>in Toronto.</i>

59
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,237
<i>My dad died suddenly in 1972.</i>

60
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:07,507
<i>I guess that's where
we should start.</i>

61
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:13,011
Give heed, O Lord, to my
prayer, the sound of my voice.

62
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,451
- You ready to go?
- I need another minute.

63
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,928
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Okay.

64
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,768
<i>People behave oddly
around the bereaved.</i>

65
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,903
Hey.

66
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,905
<i>They can't help themselves.</i>

67
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:42,041
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

68
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:47,913
- You're, like, one of the main mourners?
- Excuse me?

69
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,450
I don't mean in a bad way.

70
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,022
So...

71
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,192
what are you doing after this?

72
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,098
After this is the wake.

73
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,399
Right.

74
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,469
But after that?

75
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,148
So you think your mother suffered?

76
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,418
My wife went through
18 months of agony.

77
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:30,657
To lose your mother and your father.
I can't imagine how lonely that must be.

78
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:34,094
Every day it was worse.
That's suffering.

79
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:39,032
Just to be by yourself.
It must be so painful,

80
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:42,268
so lonely.

81
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:48,406
<i>She was wrong, of course. My parents
were gone, but I had my sister, Joan.</i>

82
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,977
<i>And we didn't know
what trouble we were in.</i>

83
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,651
So I have to ask, Dr. King. What's
the story with the clock there?

84
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,386
The clock is marked
at every 12 minutes.

85
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,556
That's how often a woman will die
of breast cancer in this country.

86
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,658
- Well, that's...
- One in nine.

87
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,994
Two million over the next 20 years.

88
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:12,365
- Potentially, but...
- Maybe your wife. Your daughter.

89
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,369
I think what Dr. King means...

90
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,238
is that the disease, along
with a potential cure,

91
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,809
is of interest to a vast number
of people... a cross section...

92
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,012
I'm sorry, Allen. I just... I wanna
be clear about this, Dr. King.

93
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:30,917
You believe that there may be a
genetic link to some breast cancers?

94
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,685
I do.

95
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,722
Even though virtually no one
else believes this to be true?

96
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,957
That's correct.

97
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,661
And to prove your theory, you're
going to have to examine the...

98
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,063
- The human genome.
- The human genome, which has...

99
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:48,599
- 100,000 genes.
- Or so, give or take a few.

100
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,340
And how many women are in your study?

101
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:58,111
- We began with several thousand.
- Not so many.

102
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:00,547
And you'd have to
interview them all, yes?

103
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:04,182
Most. Uh-huh. Yes.

104
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,322
100,000 genes, several
thousand women,

105
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,025
and no certain outcome?

106
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:14,394
Of course, we're already
well into our research.

107
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:18,730
- Oh, well, how far along are you?
- Um...

108
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,404
So, 74...

109
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,642
No, no. Um...

110
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:33,145
- six more.
- Uh-huh.

111
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,314
So, 80...

112
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,653
Um...

113
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:50,297
Right. Well, thank you. Thank you so
much for your time and your hospitality.

114
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:53,466
We'll... we'll be in touch. And
we're obviously very interested

115
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:57,068
in helping you with something
so important, so...

116
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,681
- I can't see it, Allen. I'm sorry.
- Can't see it?

117
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,550
We're looking at something
like 20 years here.

118
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,986
- Yeah, but Dr. King thinks...
- Dr. King thinks.

119
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,788
She thinks. Nobody else thinks.

120
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,857
What is it about people
like Mary-Claire King

121
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,393
that think the world
owes them a living, huh?

122
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,263
She's like that grasshopper
with his little violin.

123
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,565
- Pardon?
- Grasshopper.

124
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:30,436
You know, he plays his little violin.
He says, "The world owes me a living."

125
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,473
Give him a PhD, there's your
doctor friend right there.

126
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:39,145
You're comparing one of our most brilliant
geneticists to a cartoon grasshopper?

127
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:44,016
The answer's no, Allen.
So let's leave it alone, huh?

128
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,019
Sorry.

129
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,589
He didn't like me, did he?

130
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,158
He... No.

131
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,761
- I'm sure that...
- What did he say?

132
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,932
He compared you to an
animated grasshopper.

133
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,001
Did he? Goodness.

134
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,505
Well, that's sort of
charming in a way.

135
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,408
- Did you tell him about the...
- No, I...

136
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,044
- He wasn't having any of it.
- We could...

137
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,546
Okay. I see.

138
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,250
So, thank you...

139
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,553
for coming out.

140
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,562
- What will you do?
- What will I do? My work.

141
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:32,297
I'll do my work.

142
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,470
I do

143
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,907
I think about you day and night

144
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:45,378
It's only right to think
about the girl you love

145
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,880
And hold her tight

146
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:52,418
So happy together

147
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:58,457
I can't see me loving nobody but you

148
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,028
For all my life

149
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,731
When you're with me, da-da-da

150
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,233
Blue, da-da

151
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:10,803
You for all my life

152
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,039
Imagine me and you

153
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,708
I do

154
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,644
Wow. Sweet.

155
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:23,769
<i>It's only right to think
about the girl you love</i>

156
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,970
<i>And hold her tight so happy together</i>

157
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:35,961
<i>Yeah, yeah. I know. But we were young,
and we had lots of time on our hands.</i>

158
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,401
That is playing with
your food, which is bad.

159
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,937
These are your sister Joanie's
tomatoes, so, technically,

160
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:51,143
I'm playing with Joanie's food. I'm
playing with Joanie's tomatoes.

161
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,746
- I think he has a point.
- I don't like tomatoes.

162
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,748
- I don't like tomatoes.
- I do have a point.

163
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,583
- I like tomatoes.
- No, you don't.

164
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,453
- You do? I didn't know that.
- Then you can have my tomatoes.

165
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,488
Paul, give Louise my tomatoes.

166
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,625
No, I don't need any tomatoes. I just...
You guys are so cute together.

167
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:08,327
And I hear the thumpity thump is...

168
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,429
- Joan!
- Louise!

169
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,998
The what? The thumpity what?

170
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,966
- I think they probably...
- I can't believe you told her.

171
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,002
- I didn't know it was a secret.
- Nothing.

172
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,638
I told them you were good at
vegetable animals. Really good.

173
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,607
I like to think that my
work speaks for itself.

174
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,777
- So lifelike.
- I can't believe you told her.

175
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,014
This is gonna go down in history
as the greatest vegetable animal

176
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,016
- ...of all time, ever.
- I didn't tell her much.

177
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:34,053
Of all time. Do you see this dinosaur
that I've created in this restaurant?

178
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,922
- Excuse me. Look at this.
- No.

179
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,335
It's not a real dinosaur.

180
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:42,862
It's a triceratops made of fruit and
vegetables. Don't be afraid. It's gentle.

181
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,097
- See?
- We call him Larry.

182
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,833
You smell like fruit, Larry.

183
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,869
- You smell like cantaloupe.
- I'm sorry you're a prude.

184
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,577
Let's conclude. We have a
proposition, a thesis of sorts,

185
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:02,515
that certain breast cancers are inherited.
No one else believes this. We do.

186
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,717
To prove it, we have to
do four things. Sarah? First?

187
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,563
Find a group of women
who have breast cancer,

188
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:11,409
and from within that group,
women who have relatives...

189
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,293
- who have breast cancer.
- Second?

190
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:20,375
We then need to find a way to track the
inheritance of our breast cancer gene...

191
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:24,236
- from generation to generation.
- Third?

192
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:30,409
Even if we manage to map the
gene to a specific chromosome,

193
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,269
we then need to isolate and
sequence it to find the mutation,

194
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,117
which will take years.
And then, uh...

195
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,885
then we find out if it repeats in
the relatives. And if it does,

196
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,015
- then that is our link.
- Fourth?

197
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:47,726
Fourth and, realistically,
maybe the most difficult.

198
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:52,631
We then need to figure out why
a mutation in a single gene...

199
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,700
could lead to breast
cancer in so many women.

200
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,303
Wonderful. See you first thing.

201
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,359
- Hey.
- Why are you playing in the van?

202
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,686
- The acoustics in here are incredible.
- Slow day, then?

203
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:29,369
Strange as it may seem, no one wants
their pool service this time of year.

204
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:34,540
And look at me. I'm a
Canadian pool man.

205
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,778
I'm like one of those...
those oxy... oxy...

206
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,081
- Morons.
- Morons.

207
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,116
Yes.

208
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,218
I'm gonna go inside.

209
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,821
Oh.

210
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,157
Okay. Well...

211
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,595
I was kind of thinking maybe you
should hang out here for a bit.

212
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,734
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la</i>

213
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,736
<i>Live for today</i>

214
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,071
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la</i>

215
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,707
<i>Live for today...</i>

216
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:14,145
<i>Yeah, yeah. I know. But we were young,
and we had lots of time on our hands.</i>

217
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,182
<i>Thumpity thumpity thump.</i>

218
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,923
Gee.

219
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,902
Paul?

220
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,143
Paul?

221
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,746
What are you doing?

222
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:51,215
Nothing. Just, you know, practicing.

223
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:56,154
- You okay?
- Yeah.

224
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,467
Paul!

225
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,004
- Paul!
- What?

226
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,573
- Joanie!
- Oh!

227
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,875
- Joanie!
- What's going on?

228
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,276
- She's pregnant.
- Paul.

229
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,869
- No, I mean, you know...
- Oh, my God! Honey!

230
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,146
You're gonna be a new mommy.

231
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,483
- Okay.
- Shit!

232
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:29,088
He's... He's good-looking.

233
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,591
For a baby, you know.
In an ugly kind of way.

234
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:37,194
He's got bass player hands.

235
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,734
I mean, I'm not saying that,
you know, babies are ugly.

236
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:46,871
They just got that kind
of ugly baby thing going.

237
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,422
<i>You need to borrow</i>

238
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,291
<i>Like the platforms</i>

239
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:09,461
<i>For no one can fill</i>

240
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,764
<i>All of those needs</i>

241
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:15,200
<i>That you won't let show</i>

242
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,971
- <i>You just call on me, sister</i>
- Hey.

243
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:22,606
- <i>When you need a hand</i>
- Joanie. Hey.

244
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,515
After you had your
baby, did you, like...

245
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,018
do it less?

246
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,554
Honey, have you and Paul been...

247
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,357
It's really bad.
We're down to, like...

248
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,395
four times a week now.

249
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,301
Are you serious?

250
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,239
- That's actually quite a lot, Annie.
- It is?

251
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,374
Yeah.

252
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,813
- Sorry.
- Don't you dare!

253
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,085
No. No.

254
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,427
- Joanie, what's wrong?
- Are you okay?

255
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:20,032
- You all right?
- I'm sorry. It's just I... Excuse me.

256
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,101
Joan?

257
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,072
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

258
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,175
Oh, come on, Annie.
I make you cry, remember?

259
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,678
What is it?

260
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,814
Um...

261
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,218
Well, it might not be
as bad as it sounds.

262
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,253
Joan?

263
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:45,791
I found a lump... in my breast.

264
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,862
But you're gonna be
all right. Okay? Yeah?

265
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,263
You're gonna be just fine.

266
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,798
- Snap.
- Snap.

267
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,833
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:01,673
- I love you.
- I love you, honey.

269
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,476
- My big sister.
- That's right.

270
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,046
Four times a week.

271
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,882
Really?

272
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,052
Do you remember the man
in the room upstairs?

273
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:16,688
- It wasn't a man, it was death.
- Shh!

274
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,926
What, you think if we don't
say it, it'll go away?

275
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,395
Okay, I'll whisper.

276
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,098
Did you ever go in there?

277
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,106
Just once.

278
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:37,308
Right before...

279
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,382
No. I never did.

280
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,352
Joanie! It's not funny.
It's so not funny.

281
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,989
- I can't stop thinking about it.
- Death?

282
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,224
Shh! Yeah.

283
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:56,428
- And...
- Cancer?

284
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,596
Yeah.

285
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,266
It's stalking us.

286
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,969
Oh, you mean like that guy you
met at the Leafs game who kept...

287
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,574
calling you and sending
you chocolate hearts,

288
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,376
and then he parked
outside our house, and...

289
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,580
Dad caught him jerking
off into<i> Hockey News?</i>

290
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,519
Yeah.

291
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,689
Like him.

292
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,991
Because I'm scared.

293
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,928
I'm really, really scared
that it's inside of us,

294
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,397
it's in our family.

295
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,701
Sweetie...

296
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,169
that's not true.

297
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:47,712
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

298
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:52,583
Don't be. I like it
when you're worried.

299
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:58,589
I like it when you
have lots of problems.

300
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,282
It's gonna be really
hard without Joanie.

301
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,186
I know.

302
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:31,023
- I know.
- Come here.

303
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:34,193
Come here. Come here.

304
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:39,264
Well, at least she went quick.
Not like my wife.

305
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:44,102
Boy, she took her time, didn't she?
I mean, it was endless suffering.

306
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,237
Endless.

307
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,977
My God.

308
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,780
First your mother,

309
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,649
then your father.

310
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,685
Now... poor Joan.

311
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,502
You again? Cool.

312
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:21,039
You know, a lot of women can't be hot

313
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,175
and in mourning at the same time,

314
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,844
but you... you pull it off.

315
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:34,752
I don't mean any disrespect,
but when you think about it,

316
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:38,710
isn't sex our way of saying

317
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:42,350
"fuck you" to death?

318
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,965
How are you still working here?

319
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,278
<i>The thing was, I started thinking
about it all the time...</i>

320
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,612
<i>my family and death.</i>

321
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,116
<i>Watching me, waiting,</i>

322
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:08,954
<i>hiding in a closet or parked outside
the house, the</i> Hockey News.

323
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,423
Oh, you might feel some discomfort.

324
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,262
Beautiful day today.

325
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:20,932
Though I'm stuck in here,
it looked lovely through the window.

326
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:26,637
And I spoke to your husband.
He explained you were very worried.

327
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,242
He said I was feeling
myself up, right?

328
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:35,012
Checking, yes. Perfectly
understandable once in a while.

329
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,615
He said once in a while?

330
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,460
Yeah.

331
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:25,696
Oh, yeah. Keep talking.
Oh, keep talking.

332
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:34,139
You know, there is a simple check
you can do for testicular cancer.

333
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,274
I heard about this.

334
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:40,412
Baby, do you want me to check
you now while I'm down there?

335
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,381
- Come on.
- Annie. Annie.

336
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:45,150
What? Oh, what?

337
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:50,655
He mentioned that perhaps
you were overly concerned.

338
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:55,727
I know your family history.
It's very sad.

339
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:59,965
But that doesn't mean that
you're going to get cancer.

340
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:05,204
Look, Anne. White coat,
stethoscope. You can trust me.

341
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,339
No more worrying, okay?

342
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,075
- Okay.
- Good. That's my girl.

343
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,852
I don't know about genetics.
I know about computers.

344
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,489
You see, I make these cards, and then I
load them into the front of the computer,

345
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,626
along with everyone else's, and then,
usually the next day sometime,

346
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:30,128
depending on how many other
people are using the computer,

347
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:35,333
maybe a few days later, I get
this printout. And there you go.

348
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,936
And for the amount of data
we're going to have, how fast?

349
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:42,234
The university's mainframe computer weighs
2 1/2 tons. It's capable of storing...

350
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:45,911
- 700 kilobytes of data.
- I'm sorry. How long?

351
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:51,350
Once we get the data, make
a program and then load it...

352
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,919
Ten years?

353
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,093
Will?

354
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,463
- Yeah?
- Honey.

355
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:07,032
Come on. Get up.

356
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,901
- I'm up.
- No, no, no.

357
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,938
If you're not out of
bed, you're not up.

358
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,973
Hey.

359
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,511
- You're not gonna have breakfast?
- Uh... No, I can't.

360
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:22,613
Work. Got a new client.

361
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,351
They called this morning.

362
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:30,253
- Kiss?
- I'm already late, Annie.

363
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:37,962
What? Hey, I'm a musician,
okay? It's a look.

364
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,632
Okay.

365
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:50,375
When I grow up, I'm gonna
be a pool man, like Dad.

366
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:54,846
Do you, sweetie? Oh, that's so nice.

367
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,916
Well, maybe when you're a little
older, we'll talk about it, okay?

368
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,621
Mommy's gonna go take a shower.

369
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,830
Mommy loves you, okay?
Have a great day.

370
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,615
All right.

371
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,084
Anne...

372
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,524
your biopsy shows that you have
carcinoma of the left breast.

373
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,663
Phew. And I thought it was
gonna be really bad news.

374
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:22,300
Well, it's quite
advanced, I'm afraid.

375
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:26,204
But what I recommend
would be surgery.

376
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,906
- Surgery?
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:32,377
What's known as a modified
radical mastectomy.

378
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,448
- Oh, God.
- I'm sorry, Anne.

379
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:42,085
The surgery would require, I'm afraid,
the removal of the entire breast,

380
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:46,390
as well as most of your
underarm lymph nodes.

381
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:51,628
Oh, God. Oh, God. William.

382
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,835
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

383
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:59,604
I don't want to suffer.

384
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,640
- I know. I know.
- I don't want to suffer.

385
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:04,509
I don't want to die.

386
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,746
Oh, God.

387
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:10,682
Oh, God.

388
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,684
Oh, God.

389
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,507
Hey.

390
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,775
Hey.

391
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,716
How you doing?

392
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,621
Hey, you want an ice chip?

393
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,565
Oh.

394
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:09,406
Can I have one?

395
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:15,347
This is really good ice. Oh, my God.

396
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:21,219
Oh, my God. Wow. It's really good.

397
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,123
Ow. It hurts. Don't make me laugh.

398
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:28,525
What? Oh, don't... Oh.

399
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,002
It really hurts.

400
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,448
- And how are we feeling today?
- Not too good.

401
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:26,983
- Oh?
- I had a breast removed.

402
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:32,257
- Of course. What I meant...
- I'm feeling all right, considering.

403
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,692
Good.

404
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:38,730
But, you know, I just knew
this was gonna happen.

405
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:43,101
It happened to my mom, happened to my
sister, and it happened to my grandma...

406
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:48,340
Many women feel that way and, yes,
your family did have a bit of bad luck,

407
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,786
- but there are many complex factors...
- It's not bad luck.

408
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:55,413
There's some evidence that certain
people have a predisposition

409
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,918
- based on diet or environmental factors...
- Excuse me a minute.

410
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,922
What are you doing?

411
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,457
Well, there's just some interesting
current research that suggests...

412
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:11,062
Look, rejection of orthodoxy always seems
within the purview of the young doctor.

413
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,530
I don't know what my age
has to do with that.

414
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:15,800
However, to mislead is irresponsible.

415
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,636
There have always been articles.
There always will be articles.

416
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:22,607
But because some theory is new doesn't
make it right. Proof makes it right.

417
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:26,845
And I've seen no recent evidence concerning
alternative treatment for cancer

418
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:29,314
which would lead me to alter
the views I've acquired

419
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:32,616
over 40 years of practicing medicine.

420
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,553
- I understand.
- Good.

421
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,191
Good.

422
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:49,534
Hey, if you wanna talk some more,
you can just give me a call.

423
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:52,737
- Oh, thanks a lot, Dr....
- Doctor!

424
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,773
Sean is fine.

425
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,109
- Anne, right?
- Annie.

426
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,044
Annie.

427
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,146
Thanks.

428
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:07,118
Let me tell you, I'm gonna be the
best nurse you have ever had.

429
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,922
And I think I already am, because you
can't make out with your other nurses.

430
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:15,718
Mommy was in the hospital
because Mommy has cancer.

431
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:20,892
- Didn't Aunt Joan have cancer?
- Yeah, she did, sweetie.

432
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,528
But she died.

433
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:25,596
Yeah, she did.

434
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:29,067
- Are you gonna die?
- Hey, no.

435
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,302
I promise you.

436
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:35,006
You are not gonna lose
your mommy to cancer.

437
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,408
But how do you know?

438
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:42,012
Because I just know.
I'm not gonna die.

439
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,381
Wait.

440
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:19,249
I wanna come with you.

441
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,187
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're going to work.

442
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,457
That's not anywhere.

443
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,227
Aren't you cleaning Louise
and Steve's pool today?

444
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:33,597
I wanna come with you.
Come on. It'll be fun.

445
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,533
Please?

446
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,705
Come on, then.

447
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,747
- Let's get in.
- Yeah, right.

448
00:35:48,748 --> 00:35:50,215
I'm serious.

449
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:53,885
- Uh, we're not getting in.
- Why not?

450
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:56,320
Because I don't want to,

451
00:35:56,321 --> 00:36:01,359
and because I'm a pool man, and pool
men don't get into people's pools.

452
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,528
Is that, like, the pool man's
code of ethics or something?

453
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,535
Why is the water green?

454
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:16,107
Because Louise's dumbfuck husband
only has me come once a month.

455
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:19,510
No. No, I mean, really,
why is it green?

456
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:24,215
Oh, that's... that's algae. It's there
because the pH balance of the pool is off.

457
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:28,719
It can't be too acid or too base.
It needs to be around 7.5,

458
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,224
the same pH as human tears.

459
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:34,358
Aw.

460
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,527
See, if you, uh...

461
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,298
If you don't put chlorine in,
you get phosphates,

462
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:43,000
and algae feeds on phosphate.

463
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:47,405
But if you put chlorine in,
the algae will die.

464
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:52,742
But you can't be a dumbfuck and only
have your pool man come once a month.

465
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,248
Are you gonna keep
wearing eye makeup?

466
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:00,316
Yeah, I am.

467
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,527
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want something?

468
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:09,217
Nah. I'll stay here.

469
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,433
<i>I didn't know if the pool was green
because Paul was a bad pool man</i>

470
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:19,936
<i>or because Louise's husband was
a dumbfuck. But it made me think.</i>

471
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,947
"Breast cancer. See cancer."

472
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:30,748
Okay.

473
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,751
"Cancer. Any malignant
growth or tumor

474
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:39,022
caused by abnormal
uncontrolled cell divisions."

475
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:45,595
William?

476
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:49,900
- Willy, Mommy needs the bathroom.
- Number one or number two?

477
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,303
Number one or number two?

478
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,997
Mommy's gonna buy you
a new backpack. Okay?

479
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,937
Hi. Sorry. I'm, uh...

480
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:29,207
- Where are you off to?
- Detroit.

481
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:33,478
- Gotta run. Hope you're well.
- I am fine. What about our coffee?

482
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,147
You're late.

483
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,485
- What's going on?
- Allen, you got here too late.

484
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,988
- You're late.
- I know, I know. I'm late, I'm late.

485
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,592
We have news. We've identified
a dozen high-risk families...

486
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,494
50-some cancer cases between them.

487
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,596
- Good. And so?
- So?

488
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:54,332
So now we can begin to look
for correlations in earnest.

489
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,434
We need to interview them,
get blood samples,

490
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,736
extract the DNA, and then
begin to look for markers.

491
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,339
- Okay. "Markers"?
- Genetic markers.

492
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,509
We can track them through the families,
like a signpost on a highway.

493
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,611
Say you have two stretches
of road in the desert...

494
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,863
- And they look exactly the same.
- But if you pass signposts,

495
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:11,065
you can measure the intervals...

496
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,950
And you can identify the
different stretches of road.

497
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,986
- Even if they look...
- And if those markers

498
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:19,256
are next to something like the breast
cancer gene, it can be identified.

499
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:43,046
What is it with the magazine
selection in doctors' offices?

500
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,615
Hello.

501
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,519
<i>Field & Stream?</i>

502
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:53,957
Do a lot of your patients show
up wearing camouflage bibs,

503
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,296
a bag full of decoys,
and making duck calls?

504
00:39:58,297 --> 00:40:01,064
I don't know, ma'am.

505
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,836
I would think that you would
notice something like that.

506
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:08,171
Like I said, I don't know.

507
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,977
Quack.

508
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,749
Quack.

509
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:22,153
Quack.

510
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:23,788
Quack quack.

511
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,556
Quack.

512
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,724
Quack.

513
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,695
Nice office.

514
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:37,234
It's not mine. Dr. Benton takes long
lunches. I figure it's not hurting anybody.

515
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:42,173
It was either here or the cafeteria,
and the floors are much stickier there.

516
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:44,175
Are you sure you won't
get into any trouble?

517
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,776
I'm a doctor. I can't get in trouble.

518
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,950
What can I tell you?
I'm mostly lab-based,

519
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:56,921
but I can tell you what I know.

520
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,256
Why do I have cancer?

521
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,161
That's a big question.

522
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,965
There's no one answer.
So many factors involved.

523
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,267
I had a feeling that
you might say that.

524
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,005
You know, I had a teacher
once who told me

525
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,341
what the ideal breast
cancer patient would be.

526
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:21,746
He said the person with the highest risk
would be a nun living in a cold climate,

527
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:25,116
who was overweight, who ate
red meat, who was breast fed,

528
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:27,552
whose mother and sister had
premenopausal breast cancer,

529
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:30,520
and who was Ashkenazi Jewish.

530
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,628
<i>Not a great start,</i>

531
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:41,798
<i>but he gave me a pile of books,
and I promised to read them.</i>

532
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,849
Doesn't make any sense.

533
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,562
Oh, shit!

534
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:14,165
Good, good! Ohh!

535
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,833
<i>...the puck has cleared it behind...</i>

536
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,836
You know, it's been hard for
him, too, with everything.

537
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:22,440
It's not like he gets...

538
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:25,176
any attention.

539
00:42:25,177 --> 00:42:27,244
You're right, you know?
I'm being selfish.

540
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:30,180
No. That's not what I meant.

541
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:35,486
You're right. Maybe I am.

542
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:40,725
You know, I feel sorry
for Paul. I do, and I...

543
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:45,094
I feel sorry for me, too, but...

544
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,300
You know what I feel most of all?

545
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,337
What?

546
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,409
I just wanna be touched.

547
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,615
- Come here.
- Come on.

548
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:11,220
Come here. Come here.

549
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,268
Okay.

550
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,803
So this is something
we need to look at.

551
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,308
Don't mind me.

552
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:37,948
So does that mean I have to eat
nothing but grapefruit or something?

553
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,617
No, no. It's nothing that severe.

554
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:43,187
Although studies have shown that
foods high in fat, fried foods...

555
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:47,091
- Japanese women.
- Pardon me?

556
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:50,294
They eat very little red meat,
and they have a much lower rate

557
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,162
of breast cancer than
North American women.

558
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:54,765
Is that so?

559
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,335
Yeah.

560
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:01,572
- So did your family go out...
- Three different tests.

561
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:05,542
One was over ten years.
It's fairly conclusive.

562
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:11,714
Anyway, I'm gonna get going.

563
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,090
- So...
- We can't know anything.

564
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,126
There's so many possible factors.

565
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:25,529
It could be diet. It could
be toxins in the home.

566
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,965
One of a thousand viruses
known or unknown.

567
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:31,602
They know the groups that
have the highest incidents.

568
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:34,772
They don't know the elements
common to those groups.

569
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:38,510
We don't know what happened to
your family. We may never know.

570
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:45,382
My mom used to wrap hot dogs in
bacon, and they deep-fried them.

571
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,723
- What's this?
- It's dinner.

572
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:55,325
Where's the rest of it?

573
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:58,928
That's it. It's a salad.

574
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,768
It's got tomatoes in it.
I hate tomatoes.

575
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,871
You can pick them out.

576
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:14,410
Is everything okay?

577
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,180
Yeah. Yeah.

578
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,290
You know what? Um, I'm gonna
go get us some burgers.

579
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,604
You want one?

580
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:33,797
Yeah! But no tomatoes
and no oniony things.

581
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:37,726
No tomatoes and no
oniony things. Okay.

582
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:40,360
You want one?

583
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,781
Why are we looking
at Mormons and Jews?

584
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:53,017
Mormons tend to have
very large families,

585
00:45:53,018 --> 00:45:55,653
which makes them excellent
genetic resources.

586
00:45:55,654 --> 00:45:57,421
Plus the Church of Latter Day Saints

587
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:02,126
believes everyone related to the Mormons
has to be baptized to be saved later.

588
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:05,262
So, what, there's carcinogens in
the baptismal water they're using?

589
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:09,867
No. But they keep incredibly detailed
records of their familial ties.

590
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:15,372
A researcher before us found 30
cases of breast cancer in one family.

591
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:16,940
Called the Kindred 107.

592
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,976
Ashkenazi Jews are
important, Tom, because

593
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:21,645
they have an extraordinarily
high rate of breast cancer.

594
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:25,416
- In New York, it's an epidemic.
- Okay. But...

595
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,317
why couldn't it be the
water or the air?

596
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,887
If that was true, it would be
true of all women in the area.

597
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:32,189
Breathing the same air,
drinking the same water.

598
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,691
- But it's not.
- So it's something in them.

599
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:37,093
In their genes.

600
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,611
You're early. Dr. Gold's not here.

601
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,848
So how did you know all
that stuff the other day?

602
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:01,584
- What stuff?
- The medical stuff.

603
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:07,565
- I used to be a nurse.
- You used to be a nurse?

604
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:09,649
- Yep.
- What happened?

605
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,365
What do you mean, "what happened"?
You don't think I enjoy this? Yes?

606
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:15,966
Okay.

607
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,770
Mr. Elson, you can take your wife
through to the back with the nurse.

608
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:24,141
Seriously, what happened?

609
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:26,877
Uh...

610
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:31,381
I used to work in the oncology ward.

611
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:35,586
But it was too much, so I quit.

612
00:47:36,488 --> 00:47:40,322
You're right. Cancer patients
are a pain in the ass.

613
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,228
- Sorry.
- Hello.

614
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:47,498
Yes, Doctor, the tests will
be ready this afternoon.

615
00:47:47,499 --> 00:47:51,301
No, Doctor. I would've told you.
Okay. Bye-bye.

616
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:55,105
- You're right.
- About what?

617
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:57,641
You're all a pain in the ass.

618
00:47:58,143 --> 00:48:00,310
That's true.

619
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,914
- He likes you, you know.
- Who?

620
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:06,049
Dr. Gold?

621
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,918
Yeah, him.

622
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:10,921
- No.
- Yes, he does.

623
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:15,492
- I'm married.
- Of course. What was I thinking?

624
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:19,763
- Annie.
- Hey. Hi.

625
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:23,232
Oh. Oh.

626
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,963
I could've gotten cancer from
my mom? Like passed down?

627
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:56,900
Uh, there's no evidence that
you can get it passed down.

628
00:48:56,901 --> 00:49:00,671
All cancer is genetic in the end, just
not necessarily in the beginning.

629
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:02,472
I don't understand.

630
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:06,310
When you get cancer,
your DNA gets messed up,

631
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:11,515
and certain genes can cause
your cells to replicate wildly.

632
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:15,553
But something has to mess the
DNA up in the first place, right?

633
00:49:15,554 --> 00:49:20,189
- Right.
- Well, then, what messes it up?

634
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,126
We don't know, really.

635
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:29,232
I really didn't mean
to upset you again.

636
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:32,469
It's not you. It's me.

637
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,438
It's the chemo, I think. You know...

638
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:39,710
I even cried at the Leafs
game with Paul last night.

639
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:41,512
- You did?
- Yeah.

640
00:49:41,513 --> 00:49:46,482
It was a tie, but the
players all looked so sad.

641
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,560
Hey, An...

642
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,535
Hey, hon.

643
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:09,605
Hon.

644
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,144
Annie...

645
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,813
Why?

646
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:20,450
Why? We've got doctors.

647
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:22,586
The chemo...

648
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,322
is going well...

649
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:28,390
you know?

650
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:34,363
I've gotta do something. I...

651
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,600
Annie...

652
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:41,370
Hey, why can't you
just leave it alone?

653
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,678
<i>I really didn't know.</i>

654
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,281
<i>I think that part more than
anything drove him crazy.</i>

655
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:56,018
<i>Guys want reasons.
I should've made one up.</i>

656
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:38,328
I don't know, Annie. Maybe
you need to give him time.

657
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,797
I've given him time.

658
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,201
Maybe it has something
to do with the...

659
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:46,636
- You know. The...
- What?

660
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:50,641
I don't know. All the research.
It's a tiny, tiny bit obsessive.

661
00:51:51,743 --> 00:51:54,912
Obsessive? How?

662
00:51:54,913 --> 00:51:57,447
You know, like...

663
00:51:57,749 --> 00:52:00,115
wacko obsessive.

664
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:07,790
Wacko obsessive.
It's not the bad kind, then.

665
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,649
It's not too late to reach out
to him and to let him know...

666
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,990
how you feel.

667
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,370
What, like a blow job?

668
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,576
Yeah, that's exactly what I mean.

669
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:29,579
Have you guys heard
of Mary-Claire King?

670
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,083
She used dental genetics
to identify children

671
00:52:33,084 --> 00:52:36,186
of parents murdered by
the junta in Argentina.

672
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:42,191
But she is also doing some very interesting
work on the genetics of breast cancer.

673
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,931
<i>So I wrote to Dr. King,
and I wrote to her again,</i>

674
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,534
<i>and I wrote a third
and a fourth time.</i>

675
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:55,137
<i>I told her my story,
my family's story.</i>

676
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:13,457
<i>Books were hard for me, so I started
making models so I could understand.</i>

677
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:18,627
<i>Cells, genes,
chromosomes, and a helix.</i>

678
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,767
I'm going to the bar!

679
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,505
What?

680
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:33,409
I'm going to the effing bar because
this is an effing building site!

681
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,846
I can't hear you!

682
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:40,783
I don't fucking believe this.

683
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:43,452
I'm going out!

684
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:47,056
Hey, watch the rest of the game.
Remember the score.

685
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:51,660
Paul, would you put William to bed?

686
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:22,025
<i>We didn't discover much
in that first year,</i>

687
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:26,061
<i>but, oddly, that
mattered less and less.</i>

688
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:30,934
<i>Something mysterious
was taking hold of me.</i>

689
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:35,337
<i>I didn't know what it was then.
That would come later.</i>

690
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,912
<i>And then, some news.</i>

691
00:54:41,913 --> 00:54:46,149
Keep having you in to do
screenings every six months or so

692
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,884
just as a precautionary measure,

693
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:52,255
but I would say that
cancer is out of your life.

694
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:55,558
You have reason to celebrate.

695
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,960
Done?

696
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,630
I'm done with chemo?

697
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,433
You're done with chemo.

698
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,810
Hey.

699
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:50,180
Hey. What is this?

700
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:54,350
Uh, Louise is watching William.

701
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:57,920
Okay. Um, I...

702
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,290
I wish you had told me.

703
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:03,994
- Why?
- 'Cause I have plans.

704
00:56:03,995 --> 00:56:06,062
- You have plans?
- Yeah.

705
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:11,066
- What plans?
- Just... You know, just plans.

706
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:16,138
I...

707
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:24,681
Can you just... stay and eat a
little bit before you go at least?

708
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:27,182
Yeah. Yeah.

709
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,687
Great.

710
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:32,722
Okay.

711
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:39,596
Can you change them?

712
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:43,165
- What?
- Your plans.

713
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,002
I kind of, uh...

714
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:48,672
I made this dinner special
for us, you know?

715
00:56:48,673 --> 00:56:52,384
Thank you. I know you
went to... a lot of trouble,

716
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:54,644
- and it looks great. I just...
- No, no.

717
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:58,680
There's no trouble, Paul, you know?

718
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:05,521
We're married. Married people
do nice things for each other.

719
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,656
I know.

720
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,693
They do things together...

721
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:14,095
like make love.

722
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:18,401
Annie, please, just...

723
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:20,670
We can have sex.

724
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:22,672
Don't do this.

725
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,574
Don't you love me anymore?

726
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:29,446
Annie, I do. Hey, I want to.

727
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,148
- You want to?
- No, I... I do.

728
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:35,785
Well, then, I don't understand
what the problem is.

729
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:39,155
Why can't you make
love to me anymore?

730
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:40,857
Look, I just...
I just... I just can't.

731
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:43,725
- You can't?
- Okay? I can't.

732
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,701
Oh, is it because I
only have one breast?

733
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:53,870
- Is that what it is?
- Oh, my God, Annie.

734
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:58,308
Why don't you just, like, only put it up
halfway? Maybe you could get half-erect.

735
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,977
- Maybe you could close one eye.
- Annie, stop it!

736
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:05,415
- No, I will not stop it!
- Stop it! Stop! I can't touch you!

737
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:08,884
Okay? I can't touch you!

738
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,421
Annie...

739
00:58:11,422 --> 00:58:15,125
I can't even look at you,
at your body.

740
00:58:15,126 --> 00:58:17,460
I mean, I hate that...

741
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:21,396
that hole, that scar.

742
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:27,068
I'm sorry. I just...

743
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:39,414
Paul...

744
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,598
Knudson's two-hit theory?

745
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:31,468
Normal cells have two
undamaged chromosomes...

746
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:33,069
- ...one from the mom...
- And one from the dad.

747
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,973
<i>Right. Now, let's say there is some sort
of hereditary predisposition to cancer.</i>

748
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:40,975
<i>All that means is that one
of the genes is damaged.</i>

749
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,681
<i>I still haven't heard from Dr. King.</i>

750
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:48,051
<i>I don't think you're the only
person to write to her, Annie.</i>

751
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:50,819
<i>In the last five years, the Broad
Institute, the Genome Institute...</i>

752
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,923
<i>at Washington University,
and the Baylor College of Medicine...</i>

753
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,469
<i>And I would go through life
with this one bad gene,</i>

754
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,039
<i>and everything's still okay, because
the other gene is fine, right?</i>

755
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,208
<i>And then one of these factors
comes along, like those...</i>

756
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:15,678
<i>All that would mean is that they
would have to damage the other gene?</i>

757
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,581
<i>Right. And then the cell is damaged
enough that it can mutate.</i>

758
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:23,286
<i>- Which could be cancer.
- Could be. Can be. It's, uh...</i>

759
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,936
It's all too much.

760
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:08,997
Is this a doctorly hug?

761
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,438
I should... I should leave.

762
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:21,309
<i>He was a lovely man and a friend.</i>

763
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:26,649
<i>But love is like DNA. We can't
know its predispositions.</i>

764
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:31,654
<i>It wasn't to be. For me, anyway.</i>

765
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,111
- Where's Dad?
- I don't know, sweetie.

766
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:57,313
Maybe he went to work early.

767
01:01:57,314 --> 01:02:01,049
- Where's Dad?
- Come on. Eat your oatmeal.

768
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,001
Not this. Please. Come on.

769
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:20,336
I'm not gonna eat till you
tell me where Dad is.

770
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:23,206
- Eat your oatmeal.
- Where's Dad?

771
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:26,075
- Eat your oatmeal.
- I don't want to.

772
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,311
I said eat your goddamn oatmeal now!

773
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:37,486
Oh, God. William! Honey, I'm sorry.

774
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,497
William!

775
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:57,672
William, no. These are Mommy's things.
William, no. Please don't.

776
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:04,814
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

777
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,849
Come here. Come here.

778
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:10,019
Sweetie, come on. Come on.

779
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,088
Come on.

780
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:15,258
Hey, come on. I'm sorry.

781
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:19,059
Hey, sweetie, come on. Come here.

782
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:27,270
God, I'm sorry. I will never,
ever talk to you like that again.

783
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,539
- Okay? I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

784
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:34,109
Hey, you don't need to be sorry.
They're Mommy's silly things.

785
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:46,055
Louise? Louise!

786
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:48,090
Sweetie?

787
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,795
Louise?

788
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,135
Stop!

789
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,674
Oh, shit.

790
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,665
- Divorced?
- Yes, sweetie.

791
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,667
Mommy and Daddy are gonna
live in different houses,

792
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:06,936
but that doesn't mean we don't
love you very, very much.

793
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:09,172
This way, you'll have two houses.

794
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:12,708
I don't want two houses. I want
us all together in one house.

795
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:16,012
- So does Dad.
- Please, Paul, don't do that.

796
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:17,914
What? I'm telling the truth.

797
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,883
- I knew this was your fault.
- No, it's not my fault, honey. Paul?

798
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:25,521
Maybe if you didn't spend all
your time on this DNA shit.

799
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:30,082
- At least there's a reason for that.
- Reason? Really? What reason?

800
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:32,236
- Tell me the reason.
- Because I have to know.

801
01:05:32,237 --> 01:05:34,289
- Are you fucking joking?
- Language.

802
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,666
You have a high school
education, Annie.

803
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:39,035
You don't know anything.
You're not gonna find out anything.

804
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:41,637
- Is that why you won't touch me?
- Oh, here we go.

805
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:46,842
Oh, so you can say... you can say that.
But I fucking can't say "fucking"?

806
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:51,364
Do you wanna tell him the real
truth? Tell him about Louise?

807
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:54,501
- Oh, my God.
- What about Aunt Louise?

808
01:05:54,502 --> 01:05:58,595
Nothing, William. It's nothing.

809
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,826
Tell you what, Annie.

810
01:06:04,228 --> 01:06:07,794
I am sorry. I tried.

811
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:11,934
- I tried. I just couldn't.
- Get out.

812
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:14,702
- What?
- Get out.

813
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,145
I'll tell you what, Annie.

814
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:26,748
At least she was there for me.

815
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:41,898
I'm so sorry.

816
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,368
What's going on?

817
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,970
- Come on.
- Just listen.

818
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:50,973
These four women have breast cancer.

819
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:55,544
What they've found are certain,
let's call them odd proteins,

820
01:06:55,545 --> 01:07:00,282
that have unique configurations in the
parent gene. Let's say these are them.

821
01:07:00,584 --> 01:07:05,254
We can identify them by
their unique, say, shape.

822
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:10,026
Now, each parent donates
a gene to the child,

823
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,628
and the genes get
all mixed up, right?

824
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:16,565
But look. It's not
completely arbitrary.

825
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:18,567
- We have news.
- Genetic markers.

826
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:23,103
- We can track them through their families.
- And what we can call linkage.

827
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,442
Do you see it?

828
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:29,211
We now know that even though

829
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:34,583
our genes get all mixed up when we're
conceived, certain markers remain.

830
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:36,652
- Markers?
- Genetic markers.

831
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:42,124
We can track them through the families.
It's like a signpost on a highway.

832
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,193
Say you have two stretches
of road in the desert.

833
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:45,795
- And they look exactly the same.
- Right.

834
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:49,131
But if you pass signposts,
you can measure the intervals.

835
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:50,833
And you can identify the
different stretches of road.

836
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:52,702
Even if they look exactly the same.

837
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,471
And if those markers are next to
something, like the breast cancer gene,

838
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:58,774
- it can be identified.
- We now know that even though

839
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:04,680
our genes get all mixed up when we're
conceived, certain markers remain.

840
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:10,451
If we can find these markers, we're in
striking distance of finding our gene.

841
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:28,938
<i>Kim kept encouraging me to go out.
I think she wanted me to meet someone.</i>

842
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,475
Is your wife gonna
join you this evening?

843
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:35,411
I, um...

844
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:39,950
- I am no longer married.
- Mm-hmm.

845
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:44,186
- So is your girlfriend coming later?
- Really?

846
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:48,824
- That's really none of your business.
- Mm-hmm.

847
01:08:49,226 --> 01:08:51,327
Hey, is your daddy's
girlfriend coming tonight?

848
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:53,929
Dad doesn't have a girlfriend.

849
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:58,234
<i>- At a peewee hockey game, I met Marshall.</i>
- I'm sorry about my friend.

850
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,036
I'm Marshall.

851
01:09:00,037 --> 01:09:01,370
- I'm Annie.
- Hi.

852
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:05,507
<i>Only a Canadian girl meets a
man at a peewee hockey game.</i>

853
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,999
<i>Christmastime is almost here again</i>

854
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,702
<i>People come from far and near again</i>

855
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:39,607
<i>Isn't Christmastime
a wonderful thing?</i>

856
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:44,580
<i>Deck the halls and
hang the mistletoe</i>

857
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:47,950
<i>Kiss the ones you
love and let 'em know</i>

858
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:52,680
<i>Isn't Christmastime
a wonderful thing?</i>

859
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,759
- Dad!
- Hiya, sport!

860
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,331
Hi, Paul.

861
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,542
Hi.

862
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,877
Yeah.

863
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:17,179
- How are you?
- Hi.

864
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,682
You look good. You look great.

865
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:22,751
Really, really happy.

866
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:25,346
You okay?

867
01:10:25,347 --> 01:10:28,324
Yeah. Doing all right.

868
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:31,492
Been a little sick.

869
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:35,831
So, um, Marshall.

870
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:37,900
He's a good man.

871
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,703
- Yeah, he is.
- Yeah.

872
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:42,905
- You okay?
- Okay.

873
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:46,874
Um, I'm gonna go
get some... some food.

874
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,011
Come on, sport.

875
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:02,591
Tom, you open up the betting.

876
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,693
All right. Okay.

877
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:13,801
Another bad hand, but what the heck?

878
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:19,841
Fold.

879
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,681
Annie. Annie.

880
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:27,283
- Hey!
- I wanted to...

881
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:30,485
I'm smiling at you,
but you can fuck off.

882
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,565
This is fun.

883
01:11:42,566 --> 01:11:44,599
Yeah.

884
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:50,938
- Good to see you, guys.
- You too, man.

885
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,651
- I'd love to hear that conversation.
- Oh, no.

886
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:07,055
- You invited them.
- Yeah, but I didn't think they'd interact.

887
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,992
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

888
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:17,233
Well, I'll be back.

889
01:12:17,234 --> 01:12:20,201
Great. Okay. Yeah. We're...

890
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:27,276
Is it weird? Did it get weird?

891
01:12:27,277 --> 01:12:30,445
- Merry Christmas, Marshall.
- Merry Christmas.

892
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,816
Here's to her.

893
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:37,653
To Annie.

894
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,962
Marshall.

895
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,732
Marshall?

896
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:52,000
I'm up here, hon.

897
01:12:52,102 --> 01:12:54,837
Marshall?

898
01:12:54,838 --> 01:12:58,407
I'm in here. I, uh...

899
01:12:59,309 --> 01:13:02,578
I found the key. I thought I'd...

900
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:06,181
clean out this room. We could use
it as a guest room or, uh...

901
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,751
- No, you didn't.
- ...a study.

902
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:11,453
Keep your helixes in here.

903
01:13:11,454 --> 01:13:16,356
- <i> Did Mommy wake him up?
- Yes, she did.</i>

904
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:19,427
No. You let him out.

905
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:23,132
You let him out.

906
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:25,734
- Who?
- You...

907
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,270
There's no one here.

908
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:30,906
- It's just a room.
- You can't go in that room.

909
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:34,075
- You let him out.
- Honey, no.

910
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:36,711
It's just a...

911
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:48,261
<i>Seriously, I wouldn't believe
this either, except it happened.</i>

912
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:51,959
<i>Louise called me and
told me that Paul was ill.</i>

913
01:13:56,032 --> 01:13:58,666
Hey, um...

914
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:04,571
Doctor says colorectal cancer.

915
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,742
Hey, um...

916
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:14,617
I was looking through
these, and, uh...

917
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:19,187
thought you might wanna see them.

918
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:31,265
You gonna be okay with William?

919
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:37,305
- By yourself, I mean?
- Paul...

920
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:03,565
<i>Imagine me and you</i>

921
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:06,168
<i>I do</i>

922
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:10,272
<i>- Think about you day and night
- Day and night</i>

923
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:12,408
<i>It's only right</i>

924
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:16,545
<i>To think about the girl you love</i>

925
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:23,083
<i>and hold her tight So happy together</i>

926
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,625
What did you ever see in me?

927
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:37,800
I loved the careless,

928
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:41,469
boundless, wildness of you.

929
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:45,306
Then what happened?

930
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,177
You were boundless and careless.

931
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:01,990
Paul.

932
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:05,060
Hey, listen.

933
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,696
I want you to do something for me.

934
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:12,101
- What is that?
- I want you to believe.

935
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:15,771
Believe in what?

936
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:18,740
Believe in anything.

937
01:16:19,142 --> 01:16:21,976
Come on, Annie.

938
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:25,113
Come on. It worked for me.

939
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:30,083
Uh, no offense, but...

940
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:35,891
believing that there's some
miracle cure out there

941
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:39,193
that no one knows about, that's...

942
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,529
You gotta believe in something.

943
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:45,501
I do.

944
01:16:45,502 --> 01:16:48,769
I do believe in something, Annie.

945
01:16:57,246 --> 01:17:00,614
I believe in cancer.

946
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:06,320
And you know what else
I believe in, Annie?

947
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:10,082
I believe...

948
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:13,418
that I am going to die.

949
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,923
Okay.

950
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:54,034
I'm gonna go now, okay, sweetie?

951
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:07,549
<i>Just like he said he
would, Paul died.</i>

952
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,352
<i>I realized then that
was the difference,</i>

953
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:14,923
<i>and that was the answer to the question
everyone was always asking me.</i>

954
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:20,162
<i>Paul didn't believe in
anything in the end. I did.</i>

955
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:23,198
<i>I believed in my genes
and chromosomes.</i>

956
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:27,970
<i>I believed in my helix, and I
believed in predispositions.</i>

957
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:31,306
<i>Faith. It may not seem like faith,</i>

958
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:35,778
<i>not as you might
think it, but it is.</i>

959
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:40,148
<i>And maybe those who say
faith sustains us are right.</i>

960
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:43,518
<i>And maybe it doesn't matter
what we have faith in</i>

961
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:47,088
<i>as long as it's faith in something,</i>

962
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:49,790
<i>like the future.</i>

963
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:56,699
My brother died of lung
cancer, uh, and colon cancer.

964
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:00,602
I had never seen cancer until
I saw colon cancer, okay?

965
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:04,239
Blood coming out of everywhere,
and it was just...

966
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:08,343
I don't know how you can go on.
I don't think I could.

967
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:12,381
It's agony. It's the
shit I deal with.

968
01:19:12,382 --> 01:19:15,315
I know what it's like.

969
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:43,878
Yeah. I'm telling you,
it was the same guy.

970
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:47,814
Either one or both of
the parents were...

971
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:52,586
- Or they both had the receptive...
- One of the parents had some...

972
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:59,059
Yeah. It seemed random.

973
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,537
You okay, Annie?

974
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:19,414
I'm afraid I don't have
good news for you.

975
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:22,651
We found malignant tumors
on both your ovaries,

976
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:27,355
with involvement of the fallopian
tubes and elsewhere in your abdomen.

977
01:20:27,457 --> 01:20:30,158
Do you understand what I just said?

978
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:34,830
Now, while you do have an
advanced form of ovarian cancer,

979
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,666
we removed everything that we found.

980
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:43,270
Anything left is potentially
curable with chemotherapy.

981
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,742
Advanced?

982
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:50,211
Stage three.

983
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:53,215
You have a long,
hard fight ahead of you.

984
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:57,519
- I'm 37.
- Oh, that's very young.

985
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:01,923
You rest, and we'll
talk later, all right?

986
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:14,703
All right. I've reviewed
your pathology reports,

987
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:17,973
and it's good you had the surgery.

988
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:23,711
Please, Doctor. You know I
prefer bad news. Cheers me up.

989
01:21:23,813 --> 01:21:27,449
With what we're seeing
on your path reports,

990
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:31,520
I have to tell you,
this type of cancer

991
01:21:31,521 --> 01:21:36,625
responds best to a combination
of chemotherapy drugs.

992
01:21:36,626 --> 01:21:41,830
We'd like you to receive
cisplatin and cyclophosphamide.

993
01:21:41,831 --> 01:21:45,166
Maybe ten or twelve treatments.

994
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,402
How long?

995
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:51,038
Altogether, a year or so.

996
01:21:56,278 --> 01:22:00,481
- I've been here before.
- I know you have.

997
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:06,919
So what do you say? Hmm?

998
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:23,738
Damn, you're hot.

999
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,557
I need some water.

1000
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:47,662
One breast, no hair.

1001
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:51,631
They all want you,
but they can't have you.

1002
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:58,306
Just hold on a minute.

1003
01:22:59,008 --> 01:23:00,941
Sorry.

1004
01:23:09,885 --> 01:23:14,723
I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna
be sick. I'm gonna be sick.

1005
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:17,624
Oh!

1006
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:25,400
You are so hot, baby.

1007
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:29,070
One breast, no hair.

1008
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:33,108
What's weird is that you want
your mom. I just want my mommy.

1009
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:35,776
I just want my mommy.

1010
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,382
- You need the nurse?
- I'm in too much pain.

1011
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:44,386
- You need the nurse?
- I want... I'm in too much pain.

1012
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:47,455
Okay. Are you comfortable?

1013
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:50,692
No. I'm hot. Let me take...

1014
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:53,128
I'll take 'em off.

1015
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,498
They all want you,

1016
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:59,233
but they can't have you.

1017
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,421
- It hurts me.
- I know, sweetie.

1018
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,993
It really hurts.

1019
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,964
No.

1020
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:32,866
No, they can't.

1021
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:10,704
Dr. King, are you all right?

1022
01:25:16,477 --> 01:25:19,014
- Dr. King, are you...
- Maybe there's something acting

1023
01:25:19,015 --> 01:25:24,885
on these genes. Maybe it's not happening
independently or spontaneously.

1024
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:31,126
Controlling genes.

1025
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:34,795
Squeeze one more time for me.

1026
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:36,931
Okay. Okay.

1027
01:25:36,932 --> 01:25:40,702
Well, let's try the other arm, hmm?

1028
01:25:40,703 --> 01:25:42,470
Sorry, Annie.

1029
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:46,474
This happens when you've
had too much chemo.

1030
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:50,545
The veins get scarred
and are hard to use.

1031
01:25:50,546 --> 01:25:53,248
Like a junkie.

1032
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:58,086
Well, next time,
I'll put in a portacath.

1033
01:25:58,087 --> 01:26:02,390
- That'll last several sessions.
- Okay.

1034
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:04,993
Yeah? I think we've found one.

1035
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:07,427
- Yay.
- Right there.

1036
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:12,434
- Hey.
- Wow.

1037
01:26:12,435 --> 01:26:16,671
- Cancer<i> haute couture.</i>
- Ta-da!

1038
01:26:17,573 --> 01:26:22,076
- Not a good look, then?
- It's... a look.

1039
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:28,815
Thanks, Brian. Thank you.

1040
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:34,254
- They're beautiful.
- You are.

1041
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,461
- What's going on?
- Excellent question.

1042
01:26:39,462 --> 01:26:42,931
Let me show you what's going on.
Maybe you can figure it out for us.

1043
01:26:42,932 --> 01:26:45,066
Look around you. What do you see?

1044
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:46,568
A lot of paper.

1045
01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:48,770
Each paper represents
parts of chromosomes

1046
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:51,740
that we suspect may be active in
the cancer of our test patients.

1047
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:55,310
In other words, these areas are
variants, mutations in the DNA.

1048
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:58,279
- Our 350... all cancer sufferers.
- Why are there so many?

1049
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,582
Because it represents
many generations.

1050
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:03,318
- See these red dots?
- Yeah.

1051
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:07,155
Wherever they appear is
an indication of a mutation.

1052
01:27:07,156 --> 01:27:10,759
Black lines... morbidity, death.

1053
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,428
So there's a lot of mutation?

1054
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:16,231
Yeah. Everyone's DNA has a
certain amount of variation.

1055
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:19,968
What we're looking for is a mutation the
same place on the same chromosome.

1056
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:22,237
Mary-Claire, if we're looking
for patients who have...

1057
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:24,439
- a predisposition to breast cancer...
- Yes.

1058
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,941
That would suggest that they
were born with a mutated gene.

1059
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:29,544
- Yes.
- But most cancers occur later in life,

1060
01:27:29,545 --> 01:27:33,515
- when the telomeres are reduced in size.
- Right.

1061
01:27:33,516 --> 01:27:36,217
So if we concentrate on women
who have early-onset cancer,

1062
01:27:36,218 --> 01:27:39,921
we'd be much more likely to find
women who have a predisposition.

1063
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:42,724
We were presuming that all breast
cancers were caused by the same thing.

1064
01:27:42,725 --> 01:27:45,121
Yes, but if they have similar
tumors but different causes...

1065
01:27:45,122 --> 01:27:48,829
And we just look at women
with early-onset cancer...

1066
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,900
Do it.

1067
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:57,205
Average age, 28.

1068
01:27:57,206 --> 01:28:00,207
- 40.
- 35.

1069
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,880
Where is it?

1070
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,955
It's here.

1071
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:17,025
And here.

1072
01:28:18,327 --> 01:28:20,595
And here.

1073
01:28:21,297 --> 01:28:23,664
And here.

1074
01:28:23,866 --> 01:28:25,999
And here.

1075
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,074
We found our gene.

1076
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:39,346
That's Mary-Claire King.

1077
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:43,885
There's a link. There's a link.
You understand what I'm saying?

1078
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:49,257
There's a genetic link between
mothers and daughters

1079
01:28:49,258 --> 01:28:53,360
and sisters who have
had breast cancer.

1080
01:28:53,562 --> 01:28:57,664
See, there's a predisposition.
A kind of mutation.

1081
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:00,535
There's a link.

1082
01:29:01,437 --> 01:29:03,537
You were right.

1083
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:10,077
Excuse me.

1084
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:03,458
Hello. Hi. Hey, I heard
the good news.

1085
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:07,729
- Allen, she's in Cincinnati.
- Cincinnati?

1086
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,797
They could hardly believe it.

1087
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:12,834
Yeah, well, they
believe her now, huh?

1088
01:31:12,835 --> 01:31:16,435
They do. Anybody who
ever doubted us. Well, her.

1089
01:31:16,436 --> 01:31:18,177
- She did it.
- A single gene.

1090
01:31:18,178 --> 01:31:21,140
- Pretty much.
- Incredible.

1091
01:31:21,466 --> 01:31:22,877
So, what now?

1092
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:24,445
Oh, there's still lots to be done.

1093
01:31:24,446 --> 01:31:27,448
We have to pinpoint the
precise gene and sequence it.

1094
01:31:27,449 --> 01:31:30,350
Yeah, well, that's
where the money is.

1095
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:35,023
- The money?
- Yeah. Lots and lots and lots of money.

1096
01:31:35,024 --> 01:31:38,908
You sequence the gene,
and then you patent it. It's yours.

1097
01:31:38,909 --> 01:31:44,806
Do me a favor, will you? Say
good-bye to Dr. King for me.

1098
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:46,935
And, uh...

1099
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:52,806
you know, congrats and
all that. She is something.

1100
01:32:03,884 --> 01:32:05,686
- Excuse me, Dr. King?
- I'm sorry.

1101
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:08,189
I don't have any more time.
I'm already late for my plane.

1102
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:11,825
- My name's Annie Parker.
- Thanks.

1103
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:16,097
Oh.

1104
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:19,133
I read your letters.

1105
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:21,302
I heard you were in town.

1106
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:25,406
I tried to catch your lecture,
but the traffic was horrible.

1107
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:28,643
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It was a bit dry.

1108
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:31,379
My jokes didn't play very well.

1109
01:32:32,181 --> 01:32:34,948
- So I...
- I've wanted to meet you.

1110
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,454
I wanted to meet you, too.

1111
01:32:39,455 --> 01:32:44,290
So I heard they patented
our gene... your gene.

1112
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:47,295
That's right. They have.

1113
01:32:47,296 --> 01:32:50,076
So does that mean we get a discount
on it in the future if we need it,

1114
01:32:50,077 --> 01:32:54,944
- like a Sears card?
- It's not a cure, of course.

1115
01:32:55,571 --> 01:33:00,308
No. Yeah. I heard, but it's a start.

1116
01:33:00,309 --> 01:33:02,810
That's right. It's a start.

1117
01:33:03,712 --> 01:33:06,681
- That's a pretty necklace.
- Thank you.

1118
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:10,850
It was my mom's.
I had it restrung recently.

1119
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:13,054
- You know, she...
- Hey, I'm sorry.

1120
01:33:13,055 --> 01:33:18,625
I really do have to go. I hope
we can speak again. All the best.

1121
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:40,815
You are a remarkable woman,

1122
01:33:40,816 --> 01:33:43,251
Anne Parker.

1123
01:33:44,353 --> 01:33:48,589
I'm sorry... so sorry
I couldn't do more.

1124
01:33:49,191 --> 01:33:54,093
You did so much. So very much.

1125
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:30,264
<i>Oh, the gentlemen are talking</i>

1126
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:35,136
<i>And the midnight moon
is on the riverside</i>

1127
01:34:35,137 --> 01:34:40,408
<i>They're drinking up and walking</i>

1128
01:34:40,409 --> 01:34:45,780
<i>And it is time for me to slide</i>

1129
01:34:45,781 --> 01:34:50,084
<i>I live in another world</i>

1130
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:56,190
<i>Where life and death are memorized</i>

1131
01:34:56,191 --> 01:35:01,195
<i>Where the earth is strung
with lover's pearls</i>

1132
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:07,633
<i>And all I see are dark eyes</i>

1133
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:30,191
<i>I can't control</i>

1134
01:35:30,192 --> 01:35:34,628
<i>What life is now</i>

1135
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:41,267
<i>What will roll over me</i>

1136
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:46,374
<i>It's not freedom</i>

1137
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:49,910
<i>But it set you free</i>

1138
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:56,617
<i>So see yourself as free</i>

1139
01:35:57,219 --> 01:36:04,957
<i>As I'm falling from your reach</i>

1140
01:36:06,027 --> 01:36:09,964
<i>Don't forget</i>

1141
01:36:09,965 --> 01:36:14,001
<i>Don't regret</i>

1142
01:36:14,002 --> 01:36:17,938

1148
01:36:36,925 --> 01:36:40,528
<i>You should turn away from me</i>

1149
01:36:40,529 --> 01:36:44,330
<i>As I drift away from you</i>

1150
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:50,938
<i>If time has spent</i>

1151
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:55,176
<i>and time has come</i>

1152
01:36:55,177 --> 01:36:58,412
<i>to let me go</i>

1153
01:36:58,413 --> 01:37:02,884

1155
01:37:06,188 --> 01:37:10,689
