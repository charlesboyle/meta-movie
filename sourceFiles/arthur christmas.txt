Dear Santa, are you real?

If you live at the North Pole,

00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,139

00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,404
Does your sack have to
get bigger every year

12
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,407

population growth?

13
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,826

that you'd have to go so fast,

23
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:31,400
it would make you and the sleigh
and the reindeer all burn up.

But how do you do it?
