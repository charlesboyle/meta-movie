1
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,730
Moving onto the Hollywood Freeway,
we have a multiple vehicle...

2
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,355
multiple injury accident.

3
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,315
An absolute mess
from VineStreet to the valley.

4
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:27,655
If you're in it,
expect a long commute.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,070
If you're not,
seek alternate routes.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,365
If Dan doesn 't want to do a daily rate,
we can talk about a weekly rate.

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,575
But I'm tellin' you right now,
I'm not goin' below a million.

8
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,700
I mean, think about it.
I'm risking my reputation...

9
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,830
as the host
of this country's number-one...

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,835
nationally syndicated talk show to do
a cameo in some cheap slasher flick.

11
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,130
I mean, why can't these guys write me
a fuckin' decent part?

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,715
You know?
I lived through the fuckin' thing.

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,885
By the way, did you talk to Cathy
about that Navy SEAL script?

14
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,640
Hang on a sec.

15
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,431
- Hello?
- Hello?

16
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,851
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

17
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,103
- Who are you calling?
- Oh. You know what?

18
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,480
- I'm sorry. I have the wrong number.
- That's okay.

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,316
Wait a minute. I know your voice.

20
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:12,280
You sound a lot like that guy on TV.
Um, Cotton Weary.

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,240
- I do, huh?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,660
I think he's got
a really sexy voice.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,829
- Well, thank you.
- Wait a minute.

24
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,623
You are Cotton, aren't you?
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,378
I am talking to Cotton Weary.
I can't believe this.

26
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,797
You got me. Look, I've--
I've got someone on the other line.

27
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,049
Can you hold on one second?
I'll be right back, I promise.

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,303
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:40,516
Andrea, uh, I gotta call you back.
Someone's on the other line.

30
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:46,063
So, uh, you a big 100% Cotton fan?

31
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:50,776
- Yeah! One hundred and ten percent.
- That's very good.

32
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,697
So, um, why don't you tell me
who you are?

33
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,826
Ooh! You're a naughty boy, Cotton.
Now, what would your girlfriend say?

34
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:01,287
What makes you think
I have a girlfriend?

35
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:03,164
I know you do.

36
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:07,251
- I'm right outside her bathroom door.
- Who is this?

37
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:12,381
She's in the shower.
She's got a nice little voice.

38
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,510
Let's come in for a closer look.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,970
She's very pretty, Cotton.

40
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,098
A step up from
Maureen Prescott.

41
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,519
Speaking of which,
let's play a little game.

42
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,979
Answer right,
your girlfriend lives.

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,148
Answer wrong, she dies.

44
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:32,193
- Where's Maureen's daughter, Sidney?
- Who the fuck is this?

45
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,946
Somebody who'd kill to know
where Sidney Prescott is!

46
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,741
One chance, Cotton!
You've got connections. Where is she?

47
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:41,035
You listen to me, you fuckin' psycho.
You lay a finger on Christine...

48
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:44,705
- and I swear to God I'll kill you.
- Wrong answer!

49
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:50,336
No! Wait!
Hello? Shit!

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,463
- Hey!
- Get outta the way!

51
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:56,551
- You just hit me!
- Move!

52
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,994
Christine, if you're there,
pick up the phone!

53
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:28,291
Christine, pick up the phone!
Oh, shit!

54
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,029
You have reached 911.
Due to the volume of calls--

55
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,491
Someone pick up the goddam phone!
Move outta the way!

56
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,497
Shit! Shit!

57
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,851
Cotton, is that you?

58
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,064
Cotton?

59
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:41,906
Honey?

60
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,256
Okay, Cotton.

61
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,010
You know I don't like
your Stab games.

62
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,018
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Christine?

63
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,770
Hon, you all right?

64
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,191
- I'm home.
-Jesus! You scared the shit outta me.

65
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,488
- You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me.
- What are you talking about?

66
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,132
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, babe.

67
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:45,052
I didn't mean to scare you that bad.
It's me. Come on, open the door.

68
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,848
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What the fuck are you doing?

69
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,476
I was-- I was just, you know, trying
to take the game to the next level.

70
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,896
- I'm sorry. Come on,
open the door, Chris.
- The game?

71
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,565
- Yeah, the game!
- What are you talking about?

72
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,693
I'm talking about how much fun it's
gonna be to rip your insides out!

73
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,779
Now, open the fuckin' door, Christine!

74
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,076
- Oh, my God!
- Now you're fuckin' history, baby!

75
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,971
Christine?

76
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,935
Hon?

77
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,939
The recent epidemic of roadrage
in Los Angeles.

78
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,275
- Innocent commuters mercilessly
terrorized, even killed...
- Chris?

79
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,488
- by these madmen of the freeway.
- Don't mess around, okay?

80
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,574
We're gonna make them confront their
victims face-to-face, mano a mano...

81
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:52,411
right here on 100% Cotton.

82
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,707
There is carnage on our streets.
And remember, it could happen to you.

83
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,211
Tomorrow on 100% Cotton!
Roadrage.

84
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,296
L.A. drivers fight back.

85
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:06,509
The news is next on channel six with our
exclusive entertainment report live...

86
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,845
from tonight's celebrity
premiere in Hollywood...

87
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,598
followed by--

88
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,209
Oh, shit.

89
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,058
Chris?

90
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,103
Is that you, babe?

91
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,398
Chris, if you're in there,
open the door. Okay, honey?

92
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:07,278
Chris? Come on, baby.
Open the door.

93
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,620
Chris! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus!

94
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,039
- It's me, Chris. What are you doin'?
- Stay back.

95
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,833
Stay back.

96
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,213
- Chris, what's goin' on, babe?
- You've gone crazy. That's what!

97
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,507
- Chris, was somebody in the house?
- No! Get back!

98
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,509
Okay, okay, okay.
Just calm down, okay?

99
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,220
- Why do you want to kill me?
- What are you talking about?

100
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,640
- Why do you wanna kill me?
- Gimme the club. All right, honey?
Gimme the club.

101
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,018
Gimme the club, please.

102
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,730
Christine, get outta the way!

103
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,984
Behind you!

104
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,997
Shit!

105
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,974
It was a simple game, Cotton.
You should've told me where Sidney was.

106
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,061
Now, you lose.

107
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,749
Come on.

108
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,476
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.

109
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,614
Come on.

110
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,584
Come on, Cherokee.

111
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,020
California Women's Crisis Counseling.

112
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,190
Hey, it's Laura from Monterrey reporting
to work. Can you patch me in?

113
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,318
- Sure. Thanks, Laura.
- Thank you.

114
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,696
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
How can I help you?

115
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,700
Hi. Um, do I have to say my name?

116
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,245
No, you don't have to say anything
you don't want to say.

117
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,497
- How can I help?
- Um--

118
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,709
I'm 18 years old,
and I have a boyfriend.

119
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,170
- Sometimes he hits me.
- It's okay.

120
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,423
- You can talk to me, all right?
- Thanks.

121
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,385
So, in closing, as
the future journalists of America...

122
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,470
there is one thing
that you need to remember.

123
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,057
Being the best means being willing
to do what the others would not.

124
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,977
Break the rules.
Stop at nothing.

125
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,980
Be willing to have the world hate you,
because that is the only way...

126
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,775
that you'll get the story,
the facts and the fame.

127
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,777
Thank you.

128
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:39,282
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?

129
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,576
So you're saying that we should
be ready to go out...

130
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,830
and cut each other's throats
because that's what you did.

131
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,791
- Metaphorically, yes.
- Well, tell me, Miss Weathers.

132
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,254
- Was it worth it?
- I'm so sorry. We're out of time.

133
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,548
Gale Weathers, anchor woman for
Total Entertainment.

134
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,302
Thank you very much!

135
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,851
There is a young man outside
who wants to see you.

136
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:12,565
- He says he's with the police.
- The police?

137
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,401
- Detective Mark Kincaid, L.A.P.D.
- Hello.

138
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,486
- That's quite an impressive resume.
- Thank you.

139
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,572
I assume you're not here
for an autograph.

140
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,326
I'm here because
Cotton Weary's been murdered.

141
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,245
- Someone killed Cotton?
- And his girlfriend.

142
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,789
Someone who left something
he wanted us to see.

143
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,584
I'll show you this because
you're the Woodsboro authority
and because you knew him.

144
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,171
But I promise you,
if you share this with the world,
it's you I'll be arresting.

145
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,175
I swear on my Pulitzer Prize, which
I plan to win one day, Detective.

146
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,720
This was left on Cotton Weary's body.
You have any idea who the girl might be?

147
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,598
Oh, my God.

148
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:50,394
This is Maureen Prescott.
This is Sidney Prescott's mother.

149
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,438
Hollywood is reeling today
from news...

150
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,942
of the murder of controversial
talkshow host Cotton Weary.

151
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,653
Weary had only recently finished
shooting a cameo as himself...

152
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,947
in the film
Stab 3, Return to Woodsboro...

153
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,032
the third and final part
of the famous horror series...

154
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,285
based on the Woodsboro
and Windsor College murders.

155
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,247
Before his rise to television fame,
Cotton had been imprisoned...

156
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:15,753
and was later exonerated for the murder
of Maureen Prescott, his former lover--

157
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,849
Just yesterday, Cotton Weary was
shooting here at Sunrise Studios...

158
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,394
his first cameo
in a feature film, Stab 3.

159
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,314
Security here is tight, but we'll see
if we can get a statement. Excuse me.

160
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,400
Always a controversial man--

161
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,319
Channel Eight news.
We gotta get in. We gotta get in.

162
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,029
No press beyond this point.

163
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,033
Alone at night
he crosses flames

164
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:52,206
Ashe makes a fist
with his red right hand

165
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,586
Look, you're worried about the movie,
then protect the movie, okay?

166
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,672
Hire more security. Hire the National
Guard.Just don't kill the movie.

167
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,842
Violence in cinema
is a big deal right now, Roman.

168
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,220
This is not the kind of news
this studio is after.

169
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,347
So if we stop making
scary movies, what?

170
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,433
All the psychos in the world
will retire? Come on.

171
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,060
I've been makin' horror movies for
30 years, never had a psycho problem.

172
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,146
He was your goddamn idea, guys.
All right?

173
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,317
An ex-con with a trashy talk show?
He must've pissed people off every day.

174
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,986
Detectives, there's no reason
to presume that Cotton's death...

175
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,155
had anything to do
with this movie, is there?

176
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:30,578
He was making a movie called Stab.
He was stabbed.

177
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,041
Probably some psycho fan pissed off
they killed Randy in Stab 2.

178
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,126
Well, Tyson, that'd make you next,
wouldn't it?

179
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,171
I am not a Randy substitute.
I'm my own character.

180
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,007
Named Ricky,
who works at the video store.

181
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,967
It's an homage.

182
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,304
Hey! What if the killer's
Sidney Prescott?

183
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,598
I mean, what the hell ever happened to
her? She's probably off in the woods...

184
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,184
livin' like
the fuckin' Unabomber, man.

185
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,395
I'm starting to see why
Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
didn't want to come back.

186
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:01,150
Guys, this was about Cotton.
We are not in any danger.

187
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,613
"We are not in any danger,"
says Candy, page 15.

188
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,698
I don't see you leavin'.

189
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,993
You think serious black actors
my age can just throw away jobs?

190
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:15,081
It's all a business now. They got
Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway.

191
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,375
L.L. Cool J's
Shakespearin' in the park.

192
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,002
- Yeah!
- Maybe it's not meant to be.

193
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,673
Not meant to be? You win that
talent search for the new Sidney.

194
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,261
50,000 girls and they pick you. You
gotta be praying this movie keeps going.

195
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,138
Of course I am, but not
at the expense of people's lives.

196
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,352
Oh. Cue the violins, right?

197
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,740
Jesus.

198
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,788
Deja voodoo.

199
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,918
We need this area cleared, please.
Clear it.

200
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,713
- Gale Weathers! Oh, my God!
- Shit.

201
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,841
I-- Listen,
I-I-- I know we've never met...

202
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,427
and I don't mind you never returning
my calls, but I have to tell you...

203
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,181
after two films,
I feel like I am in your mind.

204
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,518
Well, that would explain
my constant headaches.

205
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,605
You know, I'm sorry things didn't
work out on 60 Minutes II.

206
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,441
- But Total Entertainment,
that's a pretty good fallback.
- Thank you.

207
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,902
I'm sorry that things didn't
work out with Brad Pitt...

208
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,112
but being single,
that's a pretty good fallback.

209
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,198
Gives me more time
for my work.

210
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,992
After all, Gale Weathers,
you're such a complex character.

211
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,496
Oh, and to be played by an actress
with such depth and range.

212
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,501
Uh,Jennifer,
Nick said you wanted to--

213
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,127
Gale.

214
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,380
Dewey.

215
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:51,928
Well, surprise, surprise.
Someone dies and Gale comes running.

216
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:56,390
Gale, I think you'll really appreciate
my character work in this one.

217
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:00,269
- Someone's helped me
understand the real you.
- Someone?

218
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,690
Your ruthless ambition,
your private self-loathing...

219
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,693
and that lost and lonely
little girl inside.

220
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,779
Lost and lonely what?

221
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,157
You heard me.
Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it.

222
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,743
Lost and lonely what?

223
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,497
- Little girl inside.
- I thought you were
supposed to be in Woodsboro.

224
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,999
Well, I'm surprised
you thought about me at all.

225
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,254
Listen, I gotta get back to work.
I really don't have time for this.

226
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,673
- Wait a minute. You work here?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,591
The movie needed
a technical advisor.

228
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,386
Someone who went through the real
experience, knew the real people.

229
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,848
- Hey, Dewey.
- Hey, Tom.

230
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,017
Hey! It's the real Gale Weathers.

231
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,353
Real from top to bottom.

232
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,689
Tom Prinze.
Watch your show all the time.

233
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,277
You're so right. Pop culture
is the politics ofthe 21 st century.

234
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,279
- Thank you.
- And that story that you did...

235
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,698
last month on me crashing my car?

236
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,076
-Wow, was that ever powerful journalism.
-Right, uh--

237
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,538
I especially liked the way
you implied that it was caused
by drinking and drugs.

238
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,666
And that the tyre blowout was faked.
That was great.

239
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,877
Tom, sometimes in journalism
you have to--

240
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,546
Are you parked in the lot?
'Cause I should check to make sure...

241
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:13,509
that nobody's messed
with your brake line.

242
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:18,306
Who's he supposed to be?

243
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,352
He's playing you? Him?

244
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,646
What?

245
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,065
I did not come here
to fight with you, Dewey.

246
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,277
- Cotton's killer left a picture.
- Of Sid's mom.

247
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,238
- The detectives told me.
- Well, does Sidney know about it?

248
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,116
Listen, Sidney doesn't need
you and your camera in her life.

249
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,786
Do you see a camera?

250
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,290
Right. You bought me
this purse, didn't you?

251
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,375
- Yeah.
- Look, it's-it's a habit.

252
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,419
-I-I walk outta the house, I turn it on.
-What the hell is this?

253
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,254
- It's like perfume.
- Gale Weathers?

254
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,840
- Could I be more popular?
- No press.

255
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,551
Mo press on set.
Get that woman outta here.

256
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,971
- Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is Detective Kincaid?

257
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,057
- I am working with Kincaid, Dewey.
- Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go.

258
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:08,397
Rules are rules, Gale.
But, really, it was great seeing you.

259
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,276
Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up
ahead is the old Seinfeld stage.

260
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,612
Now, does anybody
need a potty break?

261
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,114
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah, me too.

262
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,993
Okay, let go!
Thanks for your help, boys.

263
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:25,122
Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that
TV news chick, Connie-fuckin'-Chung!

264
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,584
Hey, Connie, how's Maury?

265
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:34,465
Dude, I think she likes me.
See how she's lookin' at me?

266
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,885
It's happening again.

267
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,555
Cotton had a lot
of enemies, Sid.

268
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,559
The police aren't saying
it's related to us.

269
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,813
Do you ever think about her?

270
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,274
Your mom?

271
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,610
None of this would've
ever happened if she hadn't--

272
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,364
if she hadn't--

273
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,994
Why'd she have
so many secrets, Dad?

274
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:07,331
Listen, maybe it's time
you came home.

275
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,127
I'm worried about you, kid. Out here
by yourself. You never see anyone.

276
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,089
The only people you talk to
don't even know your real name.

277
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,010
It's as if you don't exist.

278
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:26,642
That's the idea. Psychos
can't kill what they can't find.

279
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,848
Sid, come here.

280
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,725
Mother needs to talk to you.

281
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,521
Everything you touch, Sid, dies!

282
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,483
You're poison.
You're just like me.

283
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,612
You're just like me.

284
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:07,702
Oh, my God!
What have they done to me?

285
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,580
They'll do it to you.

286
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,667
- They'll do it to you, baby.
- Mom?

287
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:07,345
Roman?

288
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:13,518
Stab 3.
Jesus, I gotta get a new agent.

289
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,855
Roman?

290
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,658
Someone here?

291
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,625
Stan, my man.
He does good work, huh?

292
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,710
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Fuck you very much.

293
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:43,840
- Tyson, go to hell.
- Well, excuse us, Sarah. Makeup tests.

294
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,926
Yeah, makeup. You can use it.
Damn it, have you seen Roman?

295
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,554
Look, everyone in the office
has gone home already.

296
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:54,684
- He said it was important.
- Everything's important to Roman.

297
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,252
Oh, shit!

298
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,803
- Director's office.
- Sarah, it's Roman.

299
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,973
I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still
on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away.

300
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:38,686
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just
lookin' at your music video awards.

301
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,315
Since I got you on thephone, let's--
let's talk about your character, okay?

302
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,568
What character? I'm Candy,
the chick who gets killed second.

303
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,988
- I'm only in two scenes.
- You're not happy with your part.

304
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:53,075
I'm not happy that I am
35 playing a 21-year-old.

305
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,286
I'm not happy
that I have to die naked.

306
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,372
And I'm not happy that my character is
too stupid to have a gun in the house...

307
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,459
after her boyfriend's
been cut into fish sticks.

308
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,962
Great, okay.
So let's--let's run the lines.

309
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,839
Fine.

310
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:11,594
Page28.
Candy's big moment.

311
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,932
Page 28.

312
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,518
Ring-ring.
Hello?

313
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,229
- Hello?
- Who's this?

314
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,523
- Who's this?
- This is Candy.

315
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,650
Hang on.
Let me get some clothes.

316
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,778
See? I don't understand why I have
to start the scene in the shower.

317
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,490
The whole shower thing's been done.
Vertigo. Hello?

318
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,036
And I mean, my boyfriend just died.
Why am I showering?

319
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,330
Why don't we just read the scene?

320
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,544
Candy. Nice name. Is that like
Candy Cane or Candy Apple?

321
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,088
Whatever.

322
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,465
Come on.
Who is this?

323
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,884
I think you have
the wrong number.

324
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,638
- But you know my favourite name?
- I'm hanging up right now.

325
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,723
It's Sarah.

326
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:01,227
Roman, that's not the line.

327
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,896
It is in my script.

328
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,941
Has there been another goddam rewrite?
How the fuck...

329
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,069
are we supposed to learn our lines when
there's a new script every 15 minutes?

330
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,156
It's not just a new script.
It's a new movie.

331
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:17,702
- What? What movie?
- My movie.

332
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:23,040
And it's called Sarah Gets
Skewered Like a Fuckin' Pig!

333
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:28,421
Still in character, Sarah?

334
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,939
Shit.

335
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,214
Thank you for calling
Sunrise Picture Studios.

336
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:15,134

commissary menu, press one.

337
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,598

343
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,388
Shit!

344
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:09,981
Oh! Fuck!

345
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,707
Look, I wanna get something straight.

346
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:32,587
I only got into this because
the police asked for my help.

347
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,797
- Why would the police come to you?
- Well, I did write..

348
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,049
the definitive book
on the Woodsboro murders.

349
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,094
I'm sure you just can't wait
to write another one.

350
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,889
- What about you?
- What about me?

351
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:47,685
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro.
"It's the only place that's real."

352
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:52,023
But now you're here.
Not with me.

353
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,609
Dewey, I took care ofyou.

354
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,445
I waited until you were well,
but I couldn't stay there.

355
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,781
It was like dog years. One year in
Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else.

356
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:05,828
So it's off to Paris for a week?
New York for a month? L.A. forever?

357
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,706
It was fucking 60 Minutes II.

358
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,791
- I couldn't say no. I could've
been the next Diane Sawyer.
- Wait a minute.

359
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:16,255
What's wrong with just being
Gale Weathers? I liked her.

360
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,968
It didn't work, Dewey.
We tried. We're different.

361
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:24,889
You used to say
that was our strength.

362
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,394
- Well--
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

363
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,565
Dewey, you're not just here because
of that second-rate K-Mart...

364
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,651
straight-to-video
version of me, are you?

365
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:43,324
Brace yourself, Gale.
All of this is actually not about you.

366
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:48,621
All of what, Dewey?
You do know something, don't you?

367
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,749
- Off the record?
- Always.

368
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,710
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police
got a call from a woman...

369
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,796
who said she was with Stab 3.

370
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,632
She wanted to see the file
on Sid, "for research."

371
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,717
- And?
- The boys said no.

372
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,803
And she wouldn't give her name.

373
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,556
A month later,
the station gets broken into.

374
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,684
- The file room gets ransacked.
- And someone stole Sid's file?

375
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:13,437
I already removed it.

376
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:16,899
I think someone on the film
is tryin' to find Sid.

377
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:21,946
- I'm sorry, this is incredible.
- I said, "off the record."

378
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,575
Right.

379
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,328
It's Jennifer.
She needs me.

380
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,956
-Jennifer?
- Gotta run.

381
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:36,043
- Wait! Dewey, where are you going?
- I'm on duty.

382
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,392
Stop following me.

383
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:54,729
I happen to be working
for the police, damn it!

384
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,441
- You're not a detective, Gale.
- Neither are you, Mr Incognito.

385
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,528
- Uh, you left your motor running.
- Damn it.

386
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:07,116
Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want
a picture, they want a conversation.

387
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,619
I can handle fans!
You see this, Dewey?

388
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,539
I haven't had one ofthese in a year and
a half. Someone's gonna pay for this.

389
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,460
-Jennifer, settle down. What happened?
- I'm with him.
- You.

390
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,087
Like I'm ever going
to win an award playing you.

391
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:23,341
- There's been a second murder.
- Who?

392
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,426
- Sarah Darling.
- Where?

393
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,012
-At the studio.
-Where? Nancy Drew
wants to know where.

394
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:31,307
Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling.
Don't you get it?

395
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:36,187
Someone's killing them in the order
they die in the movie.

396
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:41,943
- Dewey, who gets killed third?
- Who gets killed third?

397
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,617
You do.

398
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:01,128
I get killed in Stab 3?
I get killed?

399
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,965
- Yeah.
- Dewey, where are you going?

400
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:06,592
I have to get something
from my trailer.

401
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,804
Your--
You live here with her?

402
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,765
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

403
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,434
I needed a place to stay,
and she said she liked having me around.

404
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:19,605
- Why?
- She says I make her feel safe.

405
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:22,733
- She says I'm her rock.
- Her rock?

406
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,653
Yeah. If you weren't so concerned
with pretensions and appearances...

407
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,698
you'd be able to appreciate the
positivity and emotional centeredness...

408
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:32,785
I provide a woman.

409
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,998
Stone, I'm headed
to the crime scene.

410
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:42,795
You stay by Jennifer's side.
I suggest a search of the grounds.

411
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:46,299
Hey, Dewdrop.
Can I have a word?

412
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:50,511
Just so it can be straight. I'm
the professional celebrity guard here.

413
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,347
My resume lists Julia Roberts,
Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice.

414
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,392
You are the Hollywood hanger-oner.

415
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,769
'Cause you're just no good
as a cop any more.

416
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,771
Your resume reads
like the obituaries.

417
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:03,691
So how about you take suggestions
from me? All right?

418
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:07,445
Whatever you say.

419
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,281
Hmm. Same deal?
Found with the body?

420
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:13,743
- Yeah, Maureen Prescott again.
- This is great.

421
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,495
Ten more murders
and we can publish a calendar.

422
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,581
The old "killer playing
with the cops" routine.

423
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:22,502
Very Hannibal Lecter.
Very Seven.

424
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,213
Doesn't the killer come after
the cops in those movies?

425
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,298
Usually one cop makes it.

426
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:31,677
- And?
- One cop doesn't.

427
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:33,763
- Usually.
- Detective Kincaid.

428
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:36,390
- What do we know? Same killer?
- Hey, hey.

429
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:39,769
Terminal Entertainment,
this is a crime scene, okay?

430
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,063
Wallace, Miss Weathers
is working with me now.

431
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,023
- Thank you, Detective.
- You're welcome.

432
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:47,860
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go dust
for fingerprints with Jane Pauley.

433
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,948
Uh, photos, Wallace, please?
Thank you.

434
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:55,034
New pictures, same person.
Anything turn up on your research yet?

435
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:58,663
- Nothing that will help with these.
- What about an increased
police presence around Jennifer?

436
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:02,416
- She's the next one
to get killed in the script.
- She has a bodyguard.

437
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,503
And besides, the producers told us
that there were three different
versions of the script.

438
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,256
Something about trying to keep
the ending off the Internet.
You should know that.

439
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:11,300
You're the technical advisor, right?

440
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,303
Three versions.
Three different characters die next.

441
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,764
And we don't know which one
the killer read.

442
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:20,434
Hey, hold up.

443
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,438
All I ever wanted to do
was make a real classic lovestory.

444
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,400
And the studio said they'd let me.
I just had to do
a scary movie for them first.

445
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,777
And now we're shut down,
and I am fucked!

446
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,113
God, it's not the end
of the world, Roman.

447
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:36,325
That is so easy foryou to say. You can
always go back to, to MustSee TV.

448
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:40,997
You know, I have no movie,
I'm about to turn 30, and it
looks like I'm now the next target.

449
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:44,750
- What?
- You? Why you?

450
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,003
Do you think this wasn't a message?

451
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,714
- Roman Bridger?
- What?

452
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,841
Mr Bridger,
you didn't tell us...

453
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,302
you spoke with Sarah Darling
before she was murdered.

454
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:56,179
Uh, spoke with her, uh, when?

455
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,515
The guard said she was here
for a meeting with you.

456
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,101
- What meeting? I don't--
- We talked with her roommate too.

457
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,188
Says you called Sarah,
told her to come down to the studio.

458
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,273
- Roommate answered the phone.
Says it was you.
- Wait a minute. No, no.

459
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,358
I-I never called her.
I never told her to go anywhere.

460
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,485
Roommate says she knows
your voice, Mr Bridger.

461
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:15,990
Well, she wasn't speaking with me! God!
Look, I did not call Sarah Darling.

462
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,327
- Sarah Darling said you did.
- Someone's trying to ruin my movie.

463
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:21,245
Someone wants to kill
my movie!

464
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,873
All right, we'll talk about
your movie down at the station.

465
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:27,043
- All right.
- This is the scene
where you come with us.

466
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,421
Dewey,Jennifer--
Wait a minute.

467
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,508
She wasn't talking with me
on the phone. I'm coming!

468
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:38,554
I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley,
do you have a cell phone I can borrow?

469
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:42,141
Yeah.

470
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,102
- Thank you.
- God. Roman.

471
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,939
Remind me not
to sleep with him again.

472
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,692
Come here, Cherokee.

473
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:55,363
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
My name is Laura. How can I help you?

474
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:59,534
Oh, Laura.
I do have a crisis.

475
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:02,370
Okay, well, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

476
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,166
Oh, my God.
I've killed someone, Laura.

477
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,252
- Are you sure ?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.

478
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:12,547
I killed someone, I know it!
Oh, my God.

479
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:15,174
- Well, then, um--
- I did.

480
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,218
Then the people you need to call
are the police.

481
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:21,764
No, I need to call you!
Just you.

482
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,850
I'm sorry, your-your voice--

483
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:29,480
Don't you wanna know
how you can help, Laura?

484
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,111
Are you listening to me?
Huh?

485
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,573
- Who is this?
- It's Mother, Laura.

486
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:42,410
Now, be a good girl
and turn on the news.

487
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,247
Do as Mother tells you!

488
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:49,250
You're not my mother. How did you
get this number? Who is this?

489
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,253
You know your mother's voice
when you hear it!

490
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:56,799
Now, turn on the news!

491
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,511
And with a second cast member
murdered, Stab 3...

492
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:03,347
has been officially shut down,
prompting those involved...

493
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:05,725
to hope and pray that
these killings maybe over.

494
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,685
Just one question.

495
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:13,065
Do you think it's over, Sidney?
Do you?

496
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:40,593
The sky was dark this morning

497
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:45,306
Not a bird in a tree

498
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,232
Is this a wrap party
or is this a wrap party?

499
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:58,277
Scene 34.
"Maureen's Murder Flashback."

500
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:02,323
- I never liked that scene.
- That's 'cause you weren't in it.

501
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,450
Scenes 40 through 47.

502
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,413
- "The Prescott House Flashbacks."
- Tom, stop it.

503
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,457
You're scaring me.
Two people are dead.

504
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,835
Scaring you?

505
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:17,421
Give the sweet,
young ingenue act a rest.

506
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:22,218
- You're drunk.
- I'm coping.

507
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:26,764
I bet she fought and clawed
for that Sidney part.

508
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,600
I bet she stepped on any poor girl
that got in her way.

509
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:34,063
- So you asked her out and she said no?
- That has nothing to do with it.

510
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,607
Right.
Come on, Dewey.

511
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:39,068
Scene 50.

512
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:43,406
"Dewey Saves the Day."

513
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,061
She's so focused on success
that she never thinks...

514
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:16,147
about who she's hurting
to get it.

515
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,357
And you saved her life, like,
how many times?

516
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:20,443
Gale wants the whole world
to love her.

517
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:23,362
One person's never enough.
She's a dreamer.

518
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:26,824
-No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch.
-No, she's not.

519
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,118
She's got a good heart.
She does.

520
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:35,708
She just hides it away because
she thinks people see that as weak.

521
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:39,420
This is a good picture of you.
You look just like her.

522
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,839
God, Dewey.

523
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:45,134
You make it sound like
you're still in love with her.

524
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,220
And I left out the part
that she's cruel...

525
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:53,476
and selfish,
obsessive and annoying.

526
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:56,729
We have one Gale Weathers here.
We don't need two.

527
00:39:56,979 --> 00:40:01,943
Hey, Dewdrop,
got your girlfriend out here.

528
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:07,240
Look who I found slinkin'
around the yard. The nightly news.

529
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,408
I wasn't slinking.
I was walking.

530
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:12,036
You were eaves dropping
at the bedroom window.

531
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,872
Yeah, a bedroom that
you seemed awfully at home in.

532
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:17,750
All right, let's talk.

533
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,003
Come on.

534
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:24,006
- What's this about, Gale?
- Did you know they released Roman?

535
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,008
Sarah's call didn't come
from his cell phone.

536
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:29,929
- Where did it come from then?
- A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable.

537
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,682
Well, thanks for the update, Gale.
Why don't you just go back home?

538
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:37,144
Dewey, wait a minute.
Just wait one second.

539
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,981
How old do you think
Maureen Prescott is in this picture?

540
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:42,733
- Nineteen, twenty.
- That's what I thought,
so I checked it out.

541
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:46,445
I cannot find any information about
her at this age. I mean, nothing.

542
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:50,283
She lived in Woodsboro her whole life.
Someone there must know something.

543
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,869
Almost her whole life.
Two years before...

544
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,580
she met Sidney's father,
she left Woodsboro.

545
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,249
No one has any idea
where she went or what she did.

546
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:02,712
I mean, it's-it's like she fell into
a black hole, Dewey! She vanished!

547
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,797
- So?
- So?

548
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,633
Why is the killer
leaving pictures of-of Maureen?

549
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:12,597
And why these pictures at-at--
at that point in her life?

550
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,892
I don't know! If I thought
like a homicidal maniac...

551
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:19,896
then I'd know how
a homicidal maniac thinks.

552
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,902
What?

553
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:30,573
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer?

554
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:37,079
Look at the buildings.
The second story. There and there.

555
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,249
It's the same!
It's the same street 28 years ago.

556
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:44,921
Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was
at the back lot at Sunrise Studios!

557
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:48,841
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta make some calls.

558
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,523
Steven Stone
Protection Services.

559
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:05,608
Stone, where are you?

560
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,402
I'm just checking
your tin can, Dewdrop.

561
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:10,404
Well, come back inside
and stay with Jennifer.

562
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,740
Something's happened.
I have to go to the police.

563
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:17,161
Is that an order, Dewdrop? 'Cause
Steven Stone doesn't work for you.

564
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:22,041
Get back in the house, Stone.
Would I call you if it wasn 't important?

565
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,252
- What are you doing in there anyway?
- Me?

566
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:26,754
I'm just checking to make sure
there's no killer in here...

567
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,674
waitin' to off you
like he did your little sister.

568
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:32,844
What did you say?
I can't believe you said that.

569
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:35,304
That makes me...

570
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:39,225
angry!

571
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:42,478
Fucker!

572
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:57,660
Gotta call Kincaid.

573
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:06,919
Dewey, where is everybody?

574
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:14,468
- Oh, God.
-Jennifer?

575
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,181
Angelina?
Tom?

576
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:22,894
Oh, my God!
What happened?

577
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:28,649
Don't do that.
I'm overreacting.

578
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:32,695
Dewdrop?

579
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:41,412
- Stone?
- Oh, my God!

580
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:43,998
Oh, God, Stone!

581
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:47,502
Oh, God!

582
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:56,052
- Dewey, is he dead?
- Yeah.

583
00:43:56,636 --> 00:44:00,389
Everyone back inside!

584
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:06,229
It's all right.
Don't panic.

585
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:10,650
Okay, outside. Everyone,
stay together and try to remain calm.

586
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,735
A phone!

587
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,363
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.

588
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:19,283
Shit!
It's the fax.

589
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,876
"Interior, Jennifer's house. Living
room, night." It's a script page.

590
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:33,005
- W-W-What's it say?
- "With the bodyguard stabbed to death,
the five stand trapped.

591
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:35,466
- He's rewriting the movie.
- As the killer waits outside...

592
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,677
suddenly the fax machine
sends news of their fates."

593
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:39,804
It's a trick!
Everybody, outside!

594
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:42,139
- Outside where he can
pick us off one by one?
- Shut up!

595
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,392
"The killer prepares to grant
mercy to only one of them."

596
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:47,812
Don't you get it? The killer says he's
outside because he wants us here inside.

597
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:50,189
- Which one is it?
- Come on!

598
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,441
"Who will survive? Is it Jennifer?
Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale?

599
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:56,237
- The killer will give mercy to--"
- Everyone outside!

600
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:59,657
He grants mercy to who?
I wanna know what happens!

601
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:02,451
- I wanna know what happens!
- Wait for the fucking movie!

602
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:04,537
- I've gotta know! I'm goin' back in!
- No.

603
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:07,248
All right, everyone, back.
Stay together.

604
00:45:07,498 --> 00:45:09,542
- What's it say?
- "And the...

605
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,794
killer will give mercy to...

606
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:14,547
- whoever--"
- Whoever?

607
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:17,175
Whoever?

608
00:45:17,425 --> 00:45:19,051
Piece of shit.

609
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:24,765
"Whoever--
Whoever smells the--"

610
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:43,117
I can't stop
rolling down the hill!

611
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:56,422
Gale!Jennifer!

612
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:58,466
- Dewey!
- Dewey!

613
00:45:58,716 --> 00:46:00,593
Dewey, where are you?

614
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:04,597
Over here, Dewey!

615
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:11,103
- Dewey!
- Gale!

616
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:15,066
Gale, behind you!

617
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:27,537
Dewey!
Are you all right?

618
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:30,831
Yeah, never been better.

619
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:33,501
Yeah, I'm all right.
Where'd he go?

620
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:38,130
- He must've rolled under the car.
- All right, stay close.

621
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:48,599
Is he back there?

622
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,477
- No.
- No?

623
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:56,274
He's fast.
Could've sworn I hit him.

624
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:02,905
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

625
00:47:03,531 --> 00:47:05,199
Thanks for saving me.

626
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:08,953
Ah, it's habit.

627
00:47:10,663 --> 00:47:14,166
Oh, God.

628
00:47:14,876 --> 00:47:18,880
What the fuck happened to you?

629
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,465
-Jennifer, wait a minute.
- Who gave you a place to stay?

630
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:24,969
-Who are you supposed to be protecting?
-Jennifer!

631
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:29,223
Hey!

632
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:36,856
My lawyer liked that.

633
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:40,943
Not as much as I did.

634
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:48,743
- Angelina?
- Tom was in the house.

635
00:47:48,993 --> 00:47:54,707
- How'd you end up way over there?
- Oh, my God! Tom was in the house!

636
00:47:56,626 --> 00:48:01,339
- Are we safe?
- Safe from who?

637
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:08,346
Wait a second!

638
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:15,102
Another picture.

639
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,652
Whoever it is is now taking credit
for Maureen Prescott's murder.

640
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:25,821
But we know who killed Maureen
Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.

641
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:28,282
-I mean, they even told Sidney
how they did it.
- Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken...

642
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:30,618
you said in your book that
Sidney got it wrong once before.

643
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:33,454
She accused Cotton Weary
of murdering her mother.

644
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:36,541
And he was sent away for it.
Maybe there is a third killer.

645
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:38,709
Sidney might know something.

646
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,337
I told you.
I don't know where Sidney is.

647
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:44,006
And even if there was a third killer,
Sidney doesn't know about it.

648
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:47,385
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her, Mr. Riley.
She is a key element in this case.

649
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:49,720
I have a press conference in an hour.
I need to explain...

650
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:52,265
why there are three dead celebrities
and a bodyguard.

651
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:55,101
And a very angry mayor.

652
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:57,186
Okay, look, we all know this has
something to do with Stab 3.

653
00:48:57,436 --> 00:49:00,273
But what we do not know is why
the killer keeps leaving pictures...

654
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:02,733
of Maureen Prescott
taken over 25 years ago.

655
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:05,570
And the photographs taken at the same
studio Stab 3 is shooting out of.

656
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,280
What does this
have to do with Sid?

657
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,074
Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?

658
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:13,870
Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you,
and he was married to Maureen.

659
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,872
What's your problem?

660
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:20,501
Last night you were almost charcoal.
You gonna help us or what?

661
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:22,712
Do you wanna have this
conversation with a polygraph?

662
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:28,342
- Is that a threat, Detective?
- When it's a threat, you'll know it.

663
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:30,720
- Was that a threat?
- Boys, boys.

664
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,264
Why don't we compare
our gun calibres later?

665
00:49:33,514 --> 00:49:36,684
- The issue is Maureen Prescott.
- Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott.

666
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:40,646
And either Mr Riley is going
to obstructjustice or he's going
to put me in touch with her.

667
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:46,110
So, where is she?

668
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:51,824
Hi, you've reached the machine.
You can leave a message.
Talk as long as you want.

669
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:54,702
Sid, it's me.
This is the fifth time I've called.

670
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:58,873
Please pick up.
I wanna make sure you're...

671
00:49:59,123 --> 00:50:01,501
okay.

672
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:05,671
- Sid!
- Dewey!

673
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:08,424
What are you doing down here?

674
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:11,719
Actually, what was I doing up there?

675
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:15,056
-Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm all right.

676
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:18,100
- Is she all right?
- Hey, you know Gale.

677
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:20,937
It'd take a direct hit.

678
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:25,483
So the news said this was the precinct.
Who's this guy Kincaid?

679
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:28,569
Come here.
I told you to stay hidden.

680
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:32,240
- It's not safe for you to be here.
- The killer called me.

681
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,617
- What?
- Yeah, he found me.

682
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:40,248
I'm no more safe there than I am here,
and at least here I'm not alone.

683
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:44,377
Okay, come on.

684
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:46,921
- Detective Kincaid?
- Yeah.

685
00:50:47,171 --> 00:50:49,590
There's someone here
who wants to help.

686
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:52,343
Oh, my God.
Sidney.

687
00:50:52,593 --> 00:50:54,512
Is the man fast or what?

688
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:59,100
- Hi.
- Hi, Gale.

689
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:02,395
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

690
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:07,191
- Sid, this is Detective Kincaid.
- Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.

691
00:51:08,776 --> 00:51:10,611
- The killer called her.
- What? When?

692
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:13,114
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know, the usual small talk.

693
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:15,616
What's new? How you been?
How do you wanna die?

694
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:18,744
Sidney, do you have any idea
how he could've gotten your number?

695
00:51:18,995 --> 00:51:21,956
He could have monitored her calls on a
scanner. Did you call her from the set?

696
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:25,168
- No.
- Do you have her number
stored in your memory?

697
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:29,422
- Phone memory!
- Oh. Yeah, guess I do.

698
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:33,551
- Has anyone else ever used your phone?
-Just Jennifer.

699
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:35,678
And you.

700
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:40,641
Hey, I'm the cop here.
You're in my office, Riley.

701
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:47,982
The killer leaves a photograph
after each murder, Sidney.

702
00:51:48,232 --> 00:51:51,194
They were taken in Hollywood at the same
studio that they're shooting Stab 3.

703
00:51:51,444 --> 00:51:54,280
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my mother, Dewey.

704
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:57,074
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid they were bait.

705
00:51:57,325 --> 00:51:59,285
Something to, you know,
trick you out of hiding.

706
00:51:59,535 --> 00:52:03,080
Sidney, was she an actress or a model?
Because they look a lot
like publicity stills.

707
00:52:03,331 --> 00:52:06,375
I, uh, don't know.

708
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:09,504
Detective, I wanna see
this place in the pictures.

709
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:15,218
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

710
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:19,722
- Slow it down.
- Sorry.

711
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:23,476
Watch the fuckin' aliens.

712
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:27,271
I'm gonna go talk to
the studio brass about those photos.

713
00:52:27,522 --> 00:52:29,357
Yeah, right.
I know where you're goin'.

714
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:31,734
- Yeah, keep an eye on Sidney.
- I know where you're goin'.

715
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:34,529
You're gonna get her some flowers
and candy, huh? Huh?

716
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:36,614
- Gimme a break.
- Yeah, gimme a call.

717
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:40,368
Just keep your eye on her.

718
00:52:46,374 --> 00:52:50,503
That stairwell over there, that's
where one of the pictures was taken.

719
00:52:50,753 --> 00:52:53,339
God. I can't believe
she never mentioned any of this.

720
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:54,882
- She probably just--
- Dewey!

721
00:52:55,132 --> 00:52:56,676
- Sorry.
- Martha!

722
00:52:56,926 --> 00:52:58,803
- Oh, my God, Sid.
- Hey, hold it right there! Hey!
- Don't shoot!

723
00:52:59,053 --> 00:53:01,180
- I'm only 17.
- It's okay. We know her.

724
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,224
We do?

725
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:05,476
Tell me that's his ex-girlfriend,
I'll shoot myself.

726
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:08,229
- It's Martha Meeks, Randy's sister.
- Randy's sister?

727
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,940
- Yeah, can't you tell?
- We miss you in Woodsboro, guys.

728
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:16,863
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- There's something you guys should see.

729
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,119
Told ya I'd make
a movie someday. Huh?

730
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:26,581
- Oh, my God.
- Well, if you're watching this tape...

731
00:53:26,831 --> 00:53:28,666
it means, as I feared, I did not
survive these killings...

732
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:31,502
here at Windsor College,
and that giving up my virginity...

733
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:34,380
to Karen Kolchakat the video store
was probably not a good idea.

734
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,841
- Karen Kolchak?
- Yes, Karen Kolchak.

735
00:53:37,091 --> 00:53:39,594
- "Creepy Karen"?
- Shut up! She's a sweet person, okay?

736
00:53:39,844 --> 00:53:42,346
We were workin'late. We were puttin'
away some videos in the porno section...

737
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:45,141
and, you know, shit happens.

738
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:48,603
- Open the door, Randy!
- Fifteen minutes.

739
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:51,397
- It's my room too!
- Paul,15 minutes.

740
00:53:51,647 --> 00:53:54,400
I'm leaving my legacy.

741
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:58,446
Fifteen minutes, Paul!
Damn! Anyway...

742
00:53:58,696 --> 00:54:02,950
the reason I'm here is to help you so
that my death will not be in vain.

743
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:08,289
That my life's work will help save some
other poor soul from getting mutilated.

744
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:10,917
If this killer does come back
and he's for real...

745
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,085
there are a few things
that you gotta remember.

746
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:16,339
Is this simply another sequel?
Well, if it is, same rules apply.

747
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:18,925
But here's the critical thing.
If you find yourself dealing...

748
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:21,469
with an unexpected back-story
and ap reponderance...

749
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:24,305
of exposition,
then the sequel rules do not apply.

750
00:54:24,555 --> 00:54:28,059
Because you're not dealing with
the sequel. You are dealing with...

751
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:31,354
the concluding chapter
of a trilogy.

752
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:34,106
- Trilogy.
- That's right. It's
a rarity in the horror field...

753
00:54:34,357 --> 00:54:36,984
but it does exist, and it is
a force to be reckoned with.

754
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:40,696
Because true trilogies are all about
going back to the beginning...

755
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:43,074
and discovering something
that wasn 't true from the get-go.

756
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,826
Godfather, Jedi,
all revealed something...

757
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:48,287
that we thought was true
that wasn 't true.

758
00:54:48,538 --> 00:54:50,748
So if it is a trilogy
you are dealing with...

759
00:54:50,998 --> 00:54:54,168
here are some super
trilogy rules.

760
00:54:54,418 --> 00:54:56,045
One: You've got a killer
who's gonna be superhuman.

761
00:54:56,295 --> 00:54:58,130
Stabbing him won't work.
Shooting him won't work.

762
00:54:58,381 --> 00:55:00,675
Basically, in the third one, you've
gotta cryogenically freeze his head...

763
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:02,593
decapitate him or blowhim up.

764
00:55:02,844 --> 00:55:05,763
Number two: Anyone, including
the main character, can die.

765
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:09,183
This means you, Sid.
I'm sorry. It's the final chapter.

766
00:55:09,433 --> 00:55:11,894
It could be fuckin' Reservoir Dogs
by the time this thing is through.

767
00:55:12,144 --> 00:55:14,897
Number three: The past will
come back to bite you in the ass.

768
00:55:15,147 --> 00:55:16,983
Whatever you think you know
about the past, forget it.

769
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:19,402
The past is not at rest!
Any sins you think...

770
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:24,949
were committed in the past are about
to break out and destroy you.

771
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:29,161
So in closing,
let me say...

772
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:31,914
goodluck, Godspeed...

773
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:36,169
and for some of you,
I'll see you soon.

774
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:39,714
'Cause the rules say some of you
ain't gonna make it. I didn't.

775
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:44,510
Not if you're watching this tape.

776
00:55:49,473 --> 00:55:53,853
Thank you. And you be careful.
Say hi to your folks for me.

777
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:56,355
You be careful too, Sid.

778
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:59,150
- Bye, Dewey. Come visit us soon.
- I will, Martha.

779
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,404
- Thank you.
- Bye.

780
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:07,992
I've got an idea.
I'll hook up with you guys later.

781
00:56:08,242 --> 00:56:10,536
- Do you want us to come with you?
- I work better alone.

782
00:56:10,786 --> 00:56:14,582
Why don't you try to figure out where
those other pictures were taken.

783
00:56:14,832 --> 00:56:19,128
- I can see nothing's changed.
- No.

784
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,553
Oh, shit.

785
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,224
Hello!

786
00:56:40,149 --> 00:56:42,151
-Jeez.
- What the hell are you doing?

787
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:44,362
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?

788
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:46,572
- I am Gale Weathers.
- Here's how I see it.

789
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:49,617
I've got no house, no bodyguard,
no movie, and I'm being stalked.

790
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:52,036
Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.

791
00:56:52,286 --> 00:56:54,413
So now, starting now,
I go where you go.

792
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:57,083
That way, if someone wants
to kill me, I'll be with you.

793
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:59,460
And since they really want to kill you,
they won't kill me, they'll kill you.

794
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,379
- Make sense?
- None.

795
00:57:01,629 --> 00:57:03,506
You know, in the movies,
I play you as being much smarter.

796
00:57:03,756 --> 00:57:07,093
And as a sane person.
Foryou, that must be quite a stretch.

797
00:57:07,343 --> 00:57:09,345
- That's funny.
- Ha!

798
00:57:09,595 --> 00:57:11,430
- Need to get in that building?
- Yeah.

799
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:13,516
- Is there a story in that building?
- Maybe.

800
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:17,520
Gale Weathers would find a way.

801
00:57:19,021 --> 00:57:21,816
Bitch. All right, wait.Just--

802
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:25,319
Don't tell me what to do.

803
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:33,202
Basements, wow.

804
00:57:33,452 --> 00:57:35,371
Basements creep me out.

805
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:39,125
You'd make
a fascinating interview.

806
00:57:42,044 --> 00:57:45,548
Hello?

807
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:55,683
Hi. Excuse me.
I am Gale Weathers...

808
00:57:55,933 --> 00:58:00,104
and I'm here researching
with the police this photo.

809
00:58:00,354 --> 00:58:02,732
It was taken at the studio.
Her name is Maureen Prescott.

810
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:05,818
Back then it was probably Roberts.

811
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:08,404
- Hey, are you--
- No.

812
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:10,781
- But you look just--
- Like her?

813
00:58:11,032 --> 00:58:13,367
- I've been hearing it all my life.
- It's uncanny.

814
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:16,704
I was up for Princess Leia.
I was this close.

815
00:58:16,954 --> 00:58:19,624
So, who gets it?
The one who sleeps with George Lucas.

816
00:58:19,874 --> 00:58:22,502
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up
a-a sore subject for you.

817
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:24,837
Sure, you didn't.
None of them did.

818
00:58:25,087 --> 00:58:29,467
So, how can I help you? Or do you want
me to tell you who you look like?

819
00:58:29,717 --> 00:58:32,178
How about some information
on Maureen Roberts?

820
00:58:32,428 --> 00:58:35,014
I don't work for the cops, sweetie.
I work for the studio.

821
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:40,228
Really? Well,
would you work for...

822
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:43,231
the president?

823
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:47,235
The president of the studio.

824
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:52,865
Fifty dollars? Who are you?
A reporter for Woodsboro High?

825
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,165
It's worth two grand.

826
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:05,253
Are you gonna help
Gale Weathers or not?

827
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:08,381
I know every face in here.

828
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:10,925
I got a respect
for the unknown actor.

829
00:59:11,175 --> 00:59:16,556
If they're looking for Maureen Roberts,
they're never gonna find her.

830
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:20,017
Rina Reynolds they will.

831
00:59:20,268 --> 00:59:24,021
Rina Reynolds.
Stage name.

832
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:27,942
You should talk,Judy Jurgenstern.

833
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:33,656
What are these movies?
Amazombies, Space Psycho...

834
00:59:33,906 --> 00:59:35,741
Creatures from the San Andreas Fault.

835
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:39,120
Horror pictures
back in Milton's heyday.

836
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:41,455
- Back in what?
- Back in what?
-John Milton.

837
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:46,002
The horror producer?
Those were his movies.

838
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,243
Come on, Sid.

839
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:48,064
Oh, my God!
Sidney Prescott!

840
01:00:48,147 --> 01:00:51,859
Oh, my God! I'm Angelina Tyler.
I'm you! I mean, I'm not.

841
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:56,197
I mean, I was.

842
01:00:59,742 --> 01:01:01,577
I-I thought-- Well,
if there's no movie...

843
01:01:01,827 --> 01:01:03,788
then no one would care
if I took some souvenirs.

844
01:01:04,038 --> 01:01:07,041
Souvenirs?

845
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:09,752
I may never win another role,
so these may be...

846
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:12,797
my only memories,
you know, of Hollywood.

847
01:01:13,047 --> 01:01:16,467
I-I know it's weird 'cause
it's your life and all, but...

848
01:01:16,717 --> 01:01:19,804
I wanted to make you proud, Sidney.

849
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:24,141
Oh. Well,
I'm sure I would've been.

850
01:01:24,392 --> 01:01:26,769
The real Sidney.
The real person.

851
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:29,814
I wish--

852
01:01:30,064 --> 01:01:34,068
I wish it would've worked out.

853
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:47,123
Hey--

854
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:55,131
Angelina?

855
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:11,397
Hello?

856
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:31,394
Close call.

857
01:03:31,644 --> 01:03:33,521
What are you doing here?

858
01:03:33,771 --> 01:03:37,358
It occurred to me that I've never
snuck through your bedroom window.

859
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:40,653
See what you do to me?

860
01:03:40,903 --> 01:03:43,656
What have I done to you?

861
01:03:43,906 --> 01:03:46,075
About the, uh, sex stuff?

862
01:03:46,325 --> 01:03:48,828
You know, I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

863
01:03:49,078 --> 01:03:54,125
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

864
01:05:15,206 --> 01:05:18,709
Dewey!

865
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:09,343
Dewey!

866
01:06:12,513 --> 01:06:16,601
Sidney, I'm in here.

867
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:24,442
Over here.

868
01:06:24,692 --> 01:06:29,280
Yes. Mother will protect you
from the bogeyman.

869
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:33,576
Come into the bedroom.

870
01:06:33,826 --> 01:06:37,496
Hide in Mommy's bed.

871
01:06:39,498 --> 01:06:41,459
I lied, Sidney.

872
01:06:41,709 --> 01:06:43,252
I can't protect you at all.

873
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:47,423
You don't deserve to be protected!
You didn't protect me!

874
01:06:47,673 --> 01:06:50,134
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slutbag whore...

875
01:06:50,384 --> 01:06:52,595
who flashed her shit all over town
like she was Sharon Stone.

876
01:06:52,845 --> 01:06:56,224
'Cause let's face it, Sidney,
your mother was no Sharon Stone.

877
01:06:56,474 --> 01:06:59,227
- Sidney's mother was fucking my father.
- Sid, where are you?

878
01:06:59,477 --> 01:07:02,688
Dewey!
Dewey, help me!

879
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:06,776
Sidney? Give Mommy a kiss
and we'll make up.

880
01:07:07,026 --> 01:07:10,029
- No!
- Sidney!

881
01:07:16,494 --> 01:07:19,038
Sid!

882
01:07:19,288 --> 01:07:21,290
Sid, are you okay?
What happened?

883
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:25,211
The killer's in the house, Dewey.
He's upstairs.

884
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:29,966
- And my mother--
- Let's go, let's go.

885
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:32,885
I heard her voice.
I saw her, Dewey.

886
01:07:33,135 --> 01:07:36,055
- Upstairs. Come on, let's go.
- It's okay, Sid.

887
01:07:36,305 --> 01:07:38,432
You weren't supposed
to go in that house.

888
01:07:38,683 --> 01:07:40,601
It's all set up for the murder scene.

889
01:07:40,852 --> 01:07:42,687
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
- He was in there, Dewey.

890
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:47,483
- He was in there, I swear, I swear.
- You know I believe you.

891
01:07:48,901 --> 01:07:51,779
- What happened?
- Kincaid, hey.

892
01:07:52,029 --> 01:07:55,283
There's nobody up here.

893
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:03,040
Come on.

894
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:06,502
- Come on.
- Okay, so I stole the mask.

895
01:08:06,752 --> 01:08:09,964
Whatever. I didn't know you got
the gas chamber for that.

896
01:08:10,214 --> 01:08:12,800
- You stole the mask?
- I took it.

897
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:16,179
- You took the mask
or you stole the mask?
- I-I took it as like a souvenir.

898
01:08:16,429 --> 01:08:18,848
- Don't look at me. I didn't take shit.
- I know he was there.

899
01:08:19,098 --> 01:08:21,017
I am not dreaming,
I am not crazy.

900
01:08:21,267 --> 01:08:24,478
- He was there in Woodsboro.
- That's not Woodsboro, Sidney.

901
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:29,317
You know what I mean. But he was there.
He or she, or whoever this is.

902
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,111
We're gonna take you back
to the station, keep you under watch.

903
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:34,697
Put you in a safe house.
Whatever it takes.

904
01:08:34,947 --> 01:08:38,451
Come on.

905
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:41,162
It's all right, Sid.
We all believe you.

906
01:08:41,412 --> 01:08:45,082
- He's watching.
- And he wants you.

907
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:49,795
- Hey, Dew.
- Dew.
- Come on.

908
01:08:50,046 --> 01:08:52,673
- We have to go catch up with Sid.
- Take a look at this first.

909
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:54,842
- Someone we know?
- Where'd you get this?

910
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:58,471
- We got it. Archives.
- Sidney's mother was an actress.
Three movies.

911
01:08:58,721 --> 01:09:03,267
-Horror movies.
-Wanna know who produced all three?
-Who?

912
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:05,394
- There'll be other movies, Roman.
- Not only did they--

913
01:09:05,645 --> 01:09:08,606
did they kill the film,
but they killed my cast.

914
01:09:08,856 --> 01:09:11,943
Now, nobody's gonna wanna work
with me. Variety called me a pariah.

915
01:09:12,193 --> 01:09:15,696
I don't even know what a pariah is.
Why-Why couldn't someone
have killed the cast from Stab 1?

916
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:18,324
Huh? Or Stab 2? Why me?
What--John, what did we do wrong?

917
01:09:18,574 --> 01:09:20,868
Hollywood is full of criminals
whose careers are flourishing.

918
01:09:21,118 --> 01:09:23,329
I'm not a criminal!
I was questioned.

919
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:25,414
Yeah, but that's all.
I was questioned. That's it.

920
01:09:25,665 --> 01:09:28,501
- That's good foryour mystique.
- You think it will help me get work?

921
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:30,711
Roman. John.

922
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:33,881
Jennifer, and guests.
To what do I owe the honour?

923
01:09:34,131 --> 01:09:37,927
- Rina Reynolds.
- Rina Reynolds? Who's Rina Reynolds?

924
01:09:38,177 --> 01:09:41,639
Why don't you head to the house?
Tell everybody not to cut
the cake without me.

925
01:09:41,889 --> 01:09:44,183
- Oh, God, I forgot. Your birthday.
- Yeah.

926
01:09:44,433 --> 01:09:47,186
- Happy birthday, Roman.
- Yeah, as if life isn't tragic enough.

927
01:09:47,436 --> 01:09:52,149
Shut the doors behind you, please.

928
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:55,361
So, you knew
Sidney Prescott's mother.

929
01:09:55,611 --> 01:09:58,823
- Who?
- Rina Reynolds?

930
01:09:59,073 --> 01:10:02,243
Do you know how many actors have
worked for me? Hundreds. Thousands.

931
01:10:02,493 --> 01:10:05,788
- He didn't say she was an actor.
- Good catch.

932
01:10:06,038 --> 01:10:08,291
- So what's the point?
- Uh, no point.

933
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,335
I'm just gonna give, uh,
Detective Kincaid a call.

934
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:15,339
I remember. She was a bit player
in a couple of my movies.

935
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,009
- A nobody. So what does it matter?
- Oh, come on.

936
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:21,804
You have made millions
off the story of her murder.

937
01:10:22,054 --> 01:10:24,891
You're obsessed with her,
and you're obsessed with her daughter!

938
01:10:25,141 --> 01:10:28,269
All right, easy, Geraldo.
Why don't you tell us the truth?

939
01:10:28,519 --> 01:10:32,523
What the hell are you guys getting at?
I make horror films, that's what I do.

940
01:10:32,773 --> 01:10:34,775
The studio came to me with Stab.

941
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:37,737
They came to me.
Check it out.

942
01:10:37,987 --> 01:10:40,615
- But you knew who she was.
- When we did the first Stab...

943
01:10:40,865 --> 01:10:43,075
I realized I had known
Maureen Prescott before.

944
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:45,620
I mean, as Rina.

945
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:49,624
I couldn't tell anyone.
Can you imagine the press?

946
01:10:49,874 --> 01:10:52,210
And now?
I mean, murders on your set.

947
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,795
- And-And still you say nothing?
- Get real.

948
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:57,423
- That would make me a suspect.
-Just because you knew her?

949
01:10:57,673 --> 01:10:59,967
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

950
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:03,971
Just what did happen to Maureen
when she was in Hollywood?

951
01:11:04,722 --> 01:11:07,308
Now, you listen to me, Lois Lane.
Let it go. It's dead and buried.

952
01:11:07,558 --> 01:11:10,770
How would you like to see it
dug up on national TV?

953
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,524
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

954
01:11:15,733 --> 01:11:18,945
It was in the '70s.
Everything was different.

955
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:22,907
I was well-known for my parties.
Rina knew what they were.

956
01:11:23,157 --> 01:11:27,495
It was for girls like her to meet men.
Men who could get them parts...

957
01:11:27,745 --> 01:11:29,580
if they made
the right impression.

958
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:31,999
Nothing happened to her
that she didn't invite...

959
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:35,461
in one way or another
no matter what she said afterwards.

960
01:11:35,711 --> 01:11:38,881
- Are you saying she--
- I'm saying things got out of hand.

961
01:11:39,131 --> 01:11:43,010
Maybe they did take advantage of her.
You know, Maybe the sad truth is...

962
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:46,806
this is not the city
for innocents.

963
01:11:47,056 --> 01:11:49,976
No charges were brought.
And the bottom line is...

964
01:11:50,226 --> 01:11:52,770
Rina Reynolds
wouldn't play by the rules.

965
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,189
You wanna get ahead in Hollywood?

966
01:11:55,439 --> 01:12:00,319
You gotta play the game, or go home.

967
01:12:04,907 --> 01:12:07,451
What do you know
about trilogies?

968
01:12:07,702 --> 01:12:11,080
- You mean, like movie trilogies?
- You seem to like movies, Detective.

969
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:15,668
Call me Mark, would you? 'Cause
I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.

970
01:12:15,918 --> 01:12:19,755
I'll call you Mark when
you catch the killer, Detective.

971
01:12:20,506 --> 01:12:24,552
All I know about movie trilogies
is that in the third one...

972
01:12:24,802 --> 01:12:28,639
all bets are off.

973
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:30,683
- Did you request this case?
- No. They tend to put me...

974
01:12:30,933 --> 01:12:32,768
on the ones that deal
with the business.

975
01:12:33,019 --> 01:12:36,105
I grew up here,
and I know my way around the studios.

976
01:12:36,355 --> 01:12:38,566
Huh.

977
01:12:38,816 --> 01:12:42,195
Must be exciting.
Beautiful place, beautiful people.

978
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:46,199
To me, Hollywood is about death.

979
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:49,243
Excuse me?

980
01:12:49,493 --> 01:12:52,830
I'm a homicide detective, remember?

981
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,791
And when you see what I see
day in and day out...

982
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,461
the violence
that people do to each other...

983
01:12:58,711 --> 01:13:00,546
you get haunted.

984
01:13:00,796 --> 01:13:04,300
I think you know about that.

985
01:13:05,051 --> 01:13:07,261
What do you mean?

986
01:13:07,512 --> 01:13:10,515
I know what it's like
to see ghosts that don't go away.

987
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:16,062
To be watching a scary movie in
your head, whether you want to or not.

988
01:13:16,354 --> 01:13:21,150
Watching it alone.

989
01:13:22,026 --> 01:13:24,529
Ghosts are tough.
You can't shoot ghosts.

990
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:27,573
Can't arrest ghosts.

991
01:13:27,823 --> 01:13:31,244
But the best way to stop being
haunted is to be with people.

992
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:33,412
You're here, you're not hiding.

993
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:38,626
You've done the right thing,
Miss Prescott.

994
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:45,466
What did you know about your mother?

995
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:51,138
I always thought
I had the perfect mom.

996
01:13:51,389 --> 01:13:54,892
Perfect family.

997
01:13:55,852 --> 01:14:00,898
Till I found out I was wrong.
She, um--

998
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:07,154
She had a secret life, and I tried
to understand that, and, um...

999
01:14:07,405 --> 01:14:13,077
soon as I thought that I had,
more secrets.

1000
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:18,165
I don't know who my mom was.

1001
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:22,253
You know who she was to you.

1002
01:14:25,298 --> 01:14:27,258
Here's the deal.
I'm off to search the set.

1003
01:14:27,508 --> 01:14:31,637
I think what you saw is real.
That's the good news.

1004
01:14:31,888 --> 01:14:33,973
- How is that good news?
- Because that means...

1005
01:14:34,223 --> 01:14:37,185
that we're dealing with
an ordinary flesh-and-blood killer.

1006
01:14:37,435 --> 01:14:40,855
- And I know how
to handle guys like that.
- Oh, yeah? How?

1007
01:14:41,105 --> 01:14:45,568
Catch him or kill him.

1008
01:14:47,612 --> 01:14:51,532
Hey, Detective.

1009
01:14:51,782 --> 01:14:55,786
What's your favourite
scary movie?

1010
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,584
My life.

1011
01:15:03,085 --> 01:15:05,630
Mine too.

1012
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,257
We have to think.
Strategize.

1013
01:15:08,508 --> 01:15:11,260
- Milton's the key to everything.
- He's a pervert, he's not a killer.

1014
01:15:11,511 --> 01:15:14,222
He's gotta be involved somehow.
We should follow him.

1015
01:15:14,472 --> 01:15:16,307
We're gonna go back to the precinct and
we're gonna tell Kincaid and Sidney...

1016
01:15:16,557 --> 01:15:18,601
what we found out.

1017
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:22,188
My Gale would be much more aggressive.
My Gale would suspect everybody.

1018
01:15:22,438 --> 01:15:26,192
- My Gale would--
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

1019
01:15:27,818 --> 01:15:30,363
- Riley here.
- Dewey, it's Sidney.
- Hey, Sid.

1020
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:32,532
- I'm with Gale.
We're on our way to see you.
- No.

1021
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:36,118
Listen, I'm not at the station.
John Milton called me and said
he had something to tell me.

1022
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:38,663
Something about my mom.
I'm going to meet him at his house.

1023
01:15:38,913 --> 01:15:41,082
Wait, Sid, I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

1024
01:15:41,332 --> 01:15:44,168
It's okay. Kincaid's with me.
I've got official big-time...

1025
01:15:44,418 --> 01:15:47,672
L.A.P.D. protection, but
I'd feel better if you were there.

1026
01:15:47,922 --> 01:15:52,009
- We're on our way, but still, Sid--
- Thanks.

1027
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:57,557
- What?
- Looks like we're going
to that party after all.

1028
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:09,694
Hey, guys. Come on in.
Join the party.

1029
01:16:09,944 --> 01:16:11,821
Yeah, well, actually,
we're here to see Sidney.

1030
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:14,115
- Really? Sidney's here.
- Where?

1031
01:16:14,365 --> 01:16:17,535
- Where's Sidney?
- She's right there!

1032
01:16:17,785 --> 01:16:21,080
Jesus!
Not "Sidney," Sidney.

1033
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:24,709
- Like I'm "Gale" and she's Gale.
- Sidney Prescott?

1034
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,670
- Yeah.
- No, I'd never invite her here.

1035
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,507
- She's on her way.
- Well, the more the merrier.

1036
01:16:31,757 --> 01:16:35,469
God, this house is incredible.

1037
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,598
-It's old Hollywood.
-Yeah. Could the dude have more money?

1038
01:16:38,848 --> 01:16:41,726
Supposedly, Milton has
a secret screening room...

1039
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:43,811
that was like the scene
back in the '70s, you know.

1040
01:16:44,061 --> 01:16:48,191
It was, like, drinks and drugs
and girls and movies and shit.

1041
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:51,110
Wow! Wish I could've seen it.

1042
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,237
Big old screening room
shouldn't be too hard to find.

1043
01:16:53,487 --> 01:16:55,323
I'm gonna go--
I'm gonna go check this place out.

1044
01:16:55,573 --> 01:16:58,951
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just one damn minute.
There's a psycho killer on the loose.

1045
01:16:59,202 --> 01:17:01,662
And you want to go traipsing around
this gigantic mansion?

1046
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:04,248
Have you ever actually seen
the Stab movies? Every time...

1047
01:17:04,498 --> 01:17:07,043
this dude enters a room,
he ends up a goddam shish kebab.

1048
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:10,296
- I'll go with you, Roman.
- There you go. You guys wanna come?

1049
01:17:10,546 --> 01:17:14,467
It'll be okay.
We're gonna stick together.

1050
01:17:14,717 --> 01:17:18,221
-You're not stickin'. Wait up.
-We're gonna stay here and wait for Sid.

1051
01:17:18,471 --> 01:17:21,599
We'll be right back!

1052
01:17:21,849 --> 01:17:24,894
If-If you were a screening room...

1053
01:17:25,144 --> 01:17:28,648
where would you be?

1054
01:17:29,941 --> 01:17:33,444
I bet in the basement.

1055
01:17:34,654 --> 01:17:38,658
I don't like basements.

1056
01:17:41,077 --> 01:17:44,580
Ooh, it's spooky.

1057
01:17:55,716 --> 01:17:57,677
- Ooh, Weredad.
- Damn, it's dark in here.

1058
01:17:57,927 --> 01:18:00,471
- I loved that movie.
- Forget the movie!
What if Milton's crazy...

1059
01:18:00,721 --> 01:18:03,224
and he's gonna jump outta his screening
room with a sling blade or something?

1060
01:18:03,474 --> 01:18:06,978
- He won't.
- You sure about that?

1061
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:14,777
- What's down there?
- Zombies and aliens.

1062
01:18:15,027 --> 01:18:17,446
You know, what you look like
without make-up, Jennifer.

1063
01:18:17,697 --> 01:18:20,825
Jesus. Stop pretending
I wasn't the best you've ever had.

1064
01:18:21,075 --> 01:18:26,664
- Oh, stop pretending I even remember.
- Stop pretending!

1065
01:18:30,334 --> 01:18:33,754
Roman?

1066
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,727
Roman?

1067
01:18:51,147 --> 01:18:54,442
- Any sign of her?
- No.

1068
01:18:54,692 --> 01:18:56,944
This is so strange.

1069
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:59,030
It sure is.

1070
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,282
Dewey, do you have caller I.D.
on your cell phone?

1071
01:19:01,532 --> 01:19:05,203
-Yeah.
-All right, use it and-and press "send."

1072
01:19:14,045 --> 01:19:17,548
What the hell?

1073
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,604
What is this thing?

1074
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:36,400
Is this what he--
What the hell?

1075
01:19:37,985 --> 01:19:40,279
Dewey, he's got our voices.

1076
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:42,365
He's got Sid.

1077
01:19:42,615 --> 01:19:44,450
He's got us all.

1078
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:48,412
- Oh, my God. We gotta find her.
- Come on.

1079
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:51,040
All right, take the gun.

1080
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,501
Go find Roman and Jennifer.
I'm gonna get the others.

1081
01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:57,255
- Be careful.
- You too.

1082
01:19:58,422 --> 01:20:04,178
Tyson! Angelina!
You up there?

1083
01:20:05,054 --> 01:20:07,849
- Roman!
- Tyson!

1084
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:10,309
Angelina!

1085
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,437
Damn it!

1086
01:20:13,688 --> 01:20:15,606
Okay, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1087
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:17,942
- Where's Angelina?
- I don't know. She went in here.

1088
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:20,236
- I came in after her. Now she's gone.
- Great.

1089
01:20:20,486 --> 01:20:25,283
- What's wrong?
- Looks like Stab 3
is back in production.

1090
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:30,204
Roman!

1091
01:20:30,454 --> 01:20:34,542
Jennifer!

1092
01:20:44,635 --> 01:20:48,639
Jennifer!

1093
01:20:52,393 --> 01:20:55,396
Roman!

1094
01:20:55,646 --> 01:20:59,150
Jennifer!

1095
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:10,620
Roman?

1096
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,345
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, very.

1097
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:31,682
Dewey! Dewey!

1098
01:21:35,186 --> 01:21:38,064
Dewey?

1099
01:21:38,314 --> 01:21:40,775
Dewey!

1100
01:21:41,025 --> 01:21:43,236
God, I'm sorry.
Jennifer, Gale, look.

1101
01:21:43,486 --> 01:21:45,947
- I found a secret passage.
- Roman's dead.

1102
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:48,658
- What?
- The killer's here.
- What?

1103
01:21:48,908 --> 01:21:52,370
- Let go of me! I'm getting out of here!
- You're not safe alone!

1104
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,455
Listen to me!

1105
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:58,793
I did not fuck that pig Milton
to get a leading role...

1106
01:21:59,043 --> 01:22:04,507
just to die here with second-rate
celebrities like you two!

1107
01:22:06,467 --> 01:22:09,637
- Gale! I'm up here.
- Come on.

1108
01:22:09,887 --> 01:22:13,307
- Dewey!
- You guys should get out too.

1109
01:22:13,558 --> 01:22:17,562
It's crazy to still be here.

1110
01:22:22,775 --> 01:22:27,321
- Wait!
- Come on!

1111
01:22:41,836 --> 01:22:44,755
- Dewey!
- Gale, Jennifer, up here!

1112
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:47,717
Dewey, here.
He got Roman and Angelina too.

1113
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:51,804
- We'll be safer if we
stick together, won't we?
- Of course. Why--

1114
01:22:53,931 --> 01:22:55,725
What's goin' on?
Oh, shit!

1115
01:22:55,975 --> 01:22:59,312
- Hey!
- Dewey!

1116
01:22:59,353 --> 01:23:02,273
Dewey!

1117
01:23:02,523 --> 01:23:05,943
No!

1118
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:17,872
Help! Police!
Help! Help!

1119
01:23:18,122 --> 01:23:22,335
Police! Help!

1120
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:32,512
Oh, you motherfucker!

1121
01:24:09,507 --> 01:24:13,010
Damn!

1122
01:24:15,847 --> 01:24:20,726
Dewey! Dewey!

1123
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:27,149
Behind the mirror, Dewey!

1124
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,236
Gale! Get away! Dewey!

1125
01:24:30,486 --> 01:24:32,655
- Do you hear something?
- Get away from me, you asshole.

1126
01:24:32,905 --> 01:24:37,577
- Get away from me! You don't scare me!
- Look, Gale. The mirror's moving.

1127
01:24:37,827 --> 01:24:41,163
- Gale! Gale!
- Stand back, Gale.

1128
01:24:41,414 --> 01:24:44,542
You can't kill me. I'm the killer
in Stab 3. I'm the killer!

1129
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:49,046
Gale, cover!

1130
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:53,217
Dewey!

1131
01:25:02,476 --> 01:25:04,812
- Tyson!
- Tyson!

1132
01:25:05,062 --> 01:25:06,898
I'm gonna check down here.
You call for help.

1133
01:25:07,148 --> 01:25:09,358
Okay.

1134
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:12,653
Tyson!

1135
01:25:12,904 --> 01:25:16,407
- Tyson?
- Any sign of him?

1136
01:25:16,657 --> 01:25:20,244
- No.
- All right. I'm gonna check out front.

1137
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:29,462
Dew--

1138
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:56,739
Gale!

1139
01:25:57,615 --> 01:26:01,536
Gale!

1140
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:04,539
Gale!

1141
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:08,793
- Dewey?
- Gale!

1142
01:26:10,169 --> 01:26:13,673
Gale!

1143
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:19,762
- Who is this?
- Dewey, it's me.

1144
01:26:20,012 --> 01:26:22,890
Gale, where are you?

1145
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,518
I'm in the basement.
I'm trapped.

1146
01:26:25,768 --> 01:26:29,522
- Where?
- There's a door in the kitchen.

1147
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:34,151
Hurry.

1148
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:40,241
Wait. How do I know this is
you, Gale, and not the killer?

1149
01:26:40,491 --> 01:26:43,870
Dewey, open the fucking door.
It's me.

1150
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,789
Well, don't you think that's
what the killer would say?

1151
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:53,462
Come on. He's out cold
at the bottom of the stairs.

1152
01:26:54,172 --> 01:26:57,842
Hey!

1153
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:13,357
Dewey. Dewey.

1154
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:24,368
All right, all right.
It's pizza, not a party.

1155
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:29,040
Everybody get back to work.
Anybody seen my fuckin' partner?

1156
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:32,793
Hey, Morgan,
what did you pay?

1157
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:23,845
- Hello?
- Hello?

1158
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:26,514
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

1159
01:28:26,764 --> 01:28:31,853
- Um, w-who's calling?
- Um, w-who's calling?

1160
01:28:32,103 --> 01:28:37,358
Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back.
I can only hear myself.

1161
01:28:37,608 --> 01:28:42,154
I only hear you too, Sidney.

1162
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:45,616
- Who is this?
- The question isn't who I am.

1163
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:49,579
The question is:
Who's with me?

1164
01:28:49,829 --> 01:28:51,664
- Sidney, stay away!
- Sidney!

1165
01:28:51,914 --> 01:28:55,251
Don't do it. If you do one thing
to attract attention to yourself...

1166
01:28:55,501 --> 01:28:58,171
one thing,
I'll kill them both.

1167
01:28:58,421 --> 01:29:03,885
Now, do you have somewhere
we can be alone?

1168
01:29:04,135 --> 01:29:08,431
- Yes.
- Yeah. Go there.

1169
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:16,397
Oh, it's hard being friends
with you, Sidney.

1170
01:29:16,647 --> 01:29:19,609
When you're friends with Sidney,
you die.

1171
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:24,155
Well, these friends don't have to,
Sidney. It's up to you.

1172
01:29:24,405 --> 01:29:26,324
- How do I know their voices are--
- Are real?

1173
01:29:26,574 --> 01:29:28,492
How do you know
you're not hearing things?

1174
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:33,873
How do you know I'm not someone
in your head? Somewhere you know.

1175
01:29:34,123 --> 01:29:36,501
- Don't come here, Sidney!
- Dewey!

1176
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:39,837
- Or do you?
- You're dead.

1177
01:29:40,087 --> 01:29:42,340
I don't want them.
I want you.

1178
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:45,176
It's simple.
You show yourself, they survive.

1179
01:29:45,426 --> 01:29:47,803
- You run, they die.
- Oh, God!

1180
01:29:48,054 --> 01:29:51,933
Don't you wanna know, Sidney,
who killed her?

1181
01:29:52,183 --> 01:29:55,520
Don't you wanna know
who killed your mother?

1182
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:57,605
- Have you seen Kincaid?
- Yeah, I saw him go out.

1183
01:29:57,855 --> 01:29:59,524
- Wallace is still lookin' for him.
- Where?

1184
01:29:59,774 --> 01:30:03,736
She'd have been so happy, Sidney,
to know we'd be together.

1185
01:30:03,986 --> 01:30:09,283
- Where?
- I'll call you when you're on your way.

1186
01:30:11,744 --> 01:30:15,957
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1187
01:31:23,149 --> 01:31:27,236
Holy shit.

1188
01:31:35,453 --> 01:31:37,747
- What?
- You follow directions well, Sidney.

1189
01:31:37,997 --> 01:31:40,041
Now, welcome to the final act.

1190
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:42,877
See that metal detector?

1191
01:31:43,127 --> 01:31:47,048
Use it.

1192
01:31:49,884 --> 01:31:54,430
All over, Sidney.
Everywhere.

1193
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,897
Everywhere.
The other leg too.

1194
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:09,320
Show it to me.

1195
01:32:13,407 --> 01:32:16,911
Throw it in the pool.

1196
01:32:18,621 --> 01:32:20,456
Now, come inside, Sidney.

1197
01:32:20,706 --> 01:32:23,501
No fucking way. How do I know
they're not dead already?

1198
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:26,963
They're right inside,
waiting for you.

1199
01:32:27,213 --> 01:32:30,716
Look for yourself.

1200
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:45,815
Now that we're all here,
the party can begin.

1201
01:32:46,065 --> 01:32:49,318
- Dewey.
- Sid.

1202
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:52,446
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1203
01:32:52,697 --> 01:32:56,617
He's right there!

1204
01:33:01,205 --> 01:33:03,833
Oh, shit.

1205
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:05,751
Think again.

1206
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:09,922
It's your turn to scream, asshole.

1207
01:33:11,799 --> 01:33:16,179
Yeah!

1208
01:33:19,265 --> 01:33:22,602
- It's okay.Just give me a second.
- Okay.

1209
01:33:22,852 --> 01:33:27,899
- Hurry, Sid.
- Sidney? Sidney?

1210
01:33:29,192 --> 01:33:33,112
Where is he?

1211
01:33:34,864 --> 01:33:38,451
Be careful!

1212
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:47,585
I heard shots. Tyson's dead.
What's goin' on?

1213
01:33:47,835 --> 01:33:50,379
- What're you doin' here, Kincaid?
- Lookin' for you.

1214
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:53,633
Tyson said there was a party here
tonight, and I thought, uh-oh.

1215
01:33:53,883 --> 01:33:55,801
Third act celebration.
Thought I better check it out.

1216
01:33:56,052 --> 01:33:59,972
Alone?
Where's your partner?

1217
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:05,144
Hey, Miss Prescott.

1218
01:34:05,394 --> 01:34:10,107
I'm here to help.
Put the gun down.

1219
01:34:11,025 --> 01:34:14,445
Put the gun down.

1220
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:21,327
No!

1221
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:29,252
Sid! Wake up, Sid!
Sid, come on!

1222
01:34:29,502 --> 01:34:33,381
- Wake up!
- Sidney!

1223
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:35,925
Sid, shoot him! Sid!

1224
01:34:36,175 --> 01:34:39,887
Shoot the fucker!

1225
01:34:40,137 --> 01:34:44,517
Shoot him!

1226
01:34:47,687 --> 01:34:50,648
You want me, motherfucker?
Come and get me.

1227
01:34:50,898 --> 01:34:55,152
Run!

1228
01:35:41,699 --> 01:35:44,660
Sid.

1229
01:35:44,911 --> 01:35:48,289
Sid.

1230
01:35:48,539 --> 01:35:54,128
Come in here, please.

1231
01:35:55,004 --> 01:35:58,966
It's just me, Sid.

1232
01:35:59,217 --> 01:36:02,929
Oh, I was so pretty.

1233
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:06,432
Everybody loved me.

1234
01:36:06,682 --> 01:36:11,145
Have you missed me, Sidney?

1235
01:36:11,729 --> 01:36:17,401
Would you like to hold me
one last time?

1236
01:36:17,735 --> 01:36:20,488
What's the matter?
What are you staring at?

1237
01:36:20,738 --> 01:36:26,744
Don't you remember your mother?

1238
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:38,631
You're not going anywhere, Sidney.

1239
01:36:38,881 --> 01:36:44,720
It's time you came to terms
with me and with Mother.

1240
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,432
Maybe you never
knew her at all, Sidney.

1241
01:36:48,683 --> 01:36:53,646
Maybe you just can't get past
the surface of things.

1242
01:36:53,896 --> 01:36:57,567
- Who the hell are you?
- The other half of you.

1243
01:36:57,817 --> 01:37:01,737
I searched for a mother too,
an actress named Rina Reynolds.

1244
01:37:01,988 --> 01:37:03,865
Tried to find her my whole life.

1245
01:37:04,115 --> 01:37:06,909
And four years ago,
I actually tracked her down.

1246
01:37:07,159 --> 01:37:10,288
Knocked at her door, thinking
she'd welcome me with open arms.

1247
01:37:10,538 --> 01:37:14,917
But she had a new life
and a new name: Maureen Prescott.

1248
01:37:15,168 --> 01:37:17,044
You were the only child
she claimed, Sidney.

1249
01:37:17,295 --> 01:37:20,131
She shut me out
in the cold forever.

1250
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:24,468
Her own son.

1251
01:37:28,764 --> 01:37:33,603
Roman Bridger, director.
And brother.

1252
01:37:33,853 --> 01:37:36,397
She slammed the door in my face, Sid.
She said I was Rina's child...

1253
01:37:36,647 --> 01:37:38,733
and Rina was dead.

1254
01:37:38,983 --> 01:37:40,902
And it struck me.

1255
01:37:41,152 --> 01:37:44,322
What a good idea!
So I watched her.

1256
01:37:44,572 --> 01:37:48,451
I made a little home movie.
A little-little family film.

1257
01:37:48,701 --> 01:37:51,621
It seems Maureen--
Mom--

1258
01:37:51,871 --> 01:37:55,833
She really got around.
I mean, Cotton was one thing.

1259
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:58,127
Everybody knew about that.

1260
01:37:58,377 --> 01:38:02,924
But Billy's father?
That was the key.

1261
01:38:03,174 --> 01:38:05,134
Your boyfriend didn't like seeing
his daddy in my film too much.

1262
01:38:05,384 --> 01:38:07,512
He didn't like it at all.

1263
01:38:07,762 --> 01:38:11,891
But once I supplied the motivation,
all the kid needed was a few pointers.

1264
01:38:12,141 --> 01:38:15,353
Have a partner to sell out in case
you get caught, find someone to frame.

1265
01:38:15,603 --> 01:38:17,897
It was like
he was making a movie.

1266
01:38:18,147 --> 01:38:22,652
You. This is all because ofyou.

1267
01:38:22,902 --> 01:38:26,322
I'm a director, Sid.

1268
01:38:26,572 --> 01:38:28,824
- I direct.
- Oh.

1269
01:38:29,075 --> 01:38:33,955
I had no idea that they were
gonna make a film of their own.

1270
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:38,501
- Oh, shit.
- What a film it turned out to be, huh?

1271
01:38:38,751 --> 01:38:41,546
I mean, introducing Sidney,
the victim.

1272
01:38:41,796 --> 01:38:46,759
Sidney, the survivor.
Sidney, the star!

1273
01:39:01,065 --> 01:39:03,150
All right. You're gonna be all right.
Just apply pressure.

1274
01:39:03,401 --> 01:39:05,653
Here, take this.
Get the son ofa bitch.

1275
01:39:05,903 --> 01:39:07,405
Let's go.

1276
01:39:07,655 --> 01:39:10,491
Fine, you got what you wanted,
hero and villain face-to-face.

1277
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:13,411
- Well, you know what happens now?
The villain dies!
- Exactly!

1278
01:39:13,661 --> 01:39:17,915
But I'm not the villain, Sid.
You are.

1279
01:39:18,165 --> 01:39:22,587
Here he is, the man who gave away
your mother's innocence.

1280
01:39:22,837 --> 01:39:25,173
Huh? What he did
to her made her a slut.

1281
01:39:25,423 --> 01:39:29,635
Didn't it? Huh? She never recovered from
that night, right here in this room.

1282
01:39:29,886 --> 01:39:33,347
They fucked her three ways from Sunday.
Ruined her life.

1283
01:39:33,598 --> 01:39:35,266
Ruined yours too,
didn't it, Sid?

1284
01:39:35,516 --> 01:39:37,894
You hate him, Sid?

1285
01:39:38,144 --> 01:39:43,733
Come on, I know you do.
I'm sure you do.

1286
01:39:43,941 --> 01:39:46,277
I know who you are.
I know what happened to my mother.

1287
01:39:46,527 --> 01:39:49,322
And I want you to understand,
I'm gonna make you pay!

1288
01:39:49,572 --> 01:39:51,407
That's what the police are gonna
find on Milton's answering machine...

1289
01:39:51,657 --> 01:39:55,203
right next to his lifeless,
mutilated corpse.

1290
01:39:55,453 --> 01:39:57,580
- What? Can't hear ya.
- You don't have to do this, Roman.

1291
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:59,707
Just tell me what you want.
I can make it happen.

1292
01:39:59,957 --> 01:40:01,876
Any picture.
Name your budget. Script approval.

1293
01:40:02,126 --> 01:40:04,212
- Final cut!
- I already have it.

1294
01:40:04,462 --> 01:40:07,798
No!

1295
01:40:08,508 --> 01:40:10,343
God! You spineless bastard!

1296
01:40:10,593 --> 01:40:13,429
No, Sid, that would be you.
You did it all.

1297
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:17,600
You did it, you called them all.
Even your closest friends.

1298
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:20,228
Living in total isolation, the pressure
ofanother movie about you...

1299
01:40:20,478 --> 01:40:23,481
the discovery that Milton
destroyed Mommy dearest...

1300
01:40:23,731 --> 01:40:26,817
you finally just snapped!

1301
01:40:27,068 --> 01:40:31,447
One, two, three!

1302
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:36,160
And who's our hero, huh?
The sole survivor. Who's the one...

1303
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:40,206
who bravely faced down the psychopath
and killed her with her own knife?

1304
01:40:40,456 --> 01:40:42,667
You're gonna pay for the life
you stole from me, Sid.

1305
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:46,629
For the mother, and for the family,
and for the stardom and--

1306
01:40:46,879 --> 01:40:49,006
Goddam it! Everything you have
that should've been mine!

1307
01:40:49,257 --> 01:40:52,260
God! Why don't you stop your whining
and get on with it?
I've heard this shit before!

1308
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:54,720
- Stop!
- You know why you kill people,
Roman? Do you?

1309
01:40:54,971 --> 01:40:57,932
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Because you choose to!
There is no one else to blame!

1310
01:40:58,182 --> 01:41:01,394
- Stop it! Fucking damn it!
- Why don't you take
some fucking responsibility?

1311
01:41:01,644 --> 01:41:05,481
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1312
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:20,705
Sid? Sidney?

1313
01:41:28,212 --> 01:41:31,716
Sidney?

1314
01:41:38,764 --> 01:41:41,851
Sidney!

1315
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:57,450
Sidney!

1316
01:41:59,619 --> 01:42:02,705
Leave her alone!

1317
01:42:12,548 --> 01:42:15,718
Dewey, do something!

1318
01:42:18,721 --> 01:42:23,267
- Stand back!
- Dewey!

1319
01:42:26,437 --> 01:42:30,274
Sid! Sid.

1320
01:42:53,589 --> 01:42:57,510
Sid?

1321
01:42:59,887 --> 01:43:03,641
Where is he?

1322
01:43:16,404 --> 01:43:19,657
Hey. Lose something?

1323
01:43:19,907 --> 01:43:23,244
Found something.

1324
01:43:44,682 --> 01:43:49,312
There's gotta be another way in there!
Come on!

1325
01:43:54,150 --> 01:43:58,863
You hurt her,
I swear I'll kill you!

1326
01:44:11,459 --> 01:44:15,713
-Dewey!
-Down this way. There's another hallway.

1327
01:44:26,474 --> 01:44:29,977
There's another door down here.

1328
01:44:35,775 --> 01:44:38,027
- This thing's not budging.
- Look around for something heavy.

1329
01:44:38,277 --> 01:44:42,448
- Go that way.
- Okay!

1330
01:45:07,014 --> 01:45:10,685
I shot you.

1331
01:45:14,397 --> 01:45:19,026
I guess we think alike.

1332
01:45:19,026 --> 01:45:21,779
Mother's dead.

1333
01:45:22,029 --> 01:45:25,533
And there is nothing
you can do about that.

1334
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:28,911
I still got
to make my movie.

1335
01:45:29,161 --> 01:45:33,165
Stab 3, right?

1336
01:45:49,348 --> 01:45:53,269
Kincaid, hang in there.

1337
01:45:53,436 --> 01:45:58,566
Roman? It was Roman?

1338
01:46:21,923 --> 01:46:27,220
Be careful, Sid. Randy said
the killer's always superhuman.

1339
01:46:28,554 --> 01:46:32,350
Yeah, well,
he wasn't superhuman, Dewey.

1340
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:36,354
He wasn't superhuman at all.

1341
01:46:40,441 --> 01:46:42,485
- You can't fuckin' kill me!
- Head!

1342
01:46:42,735 --> 01:46:44,987
- Head! Head, Dewey!
- What?

1343
01:46:45,238 --> 01:46:48,908
Head!
Shoot him in the head.

1344
01:47:00,378 --> 01:47:02,421
Thanks.

1345
01:47:02,672 --> 01:47:06,175
No problem.

1346
01:47:31,242 --> 01:47:33,619
Look.

1347
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:35,997
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.

1348
01:47:36,247 --> 01:47:40,960
- Yeah, she's doin' great.
- Yeah.

1349
01:47:44,630 --> 01:47:48,134
Look.

1350
01:47:48,426 --> 01:47:50,386
What are you doing with that?

1351
01:47:50,636 --> 01:47:54,348
Um, will you sign it
for me, Gale?

1352
01:47:54,599 --> 01:47:56,851
You hate that book.

1353
01:47:57,101 --> 01:48:00,229
Besides, I'm-l'm done
with that kind of reporting.

1354
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:05,860
For me.
Will you sign it for me?

1355
01:48:07,069 --> 01:48:09,947
You're a nut.

1356
01:48:10,198 --> 01:48:13,284
Okay.

1357
01:48:22,001 --> 01:48:26,297
- Will you?
- Dewey.

1358
01:48:26,547 --> 01:48:30,051
I know it'll never work,
and you know it'll never work.

1359
01:48:30,301 --> 01:48:37,600
But what I'm asking is
just to see ifwe're wrong.

1360
01:48:37,934 --> 01:48:41,854
We don't know everything, Gale.

1361
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:47,610
I mean, you think you do, but--

1362
01:48:53,491 --> 01:48:57,078
You're a brave man,
Dewey Riley.

1363
01:48:57,495 --> 01:49:01,666
I'm really scared right now.

1364
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:48,087
Inside.

1365
01:49:52,808 --> 01:49:56,450
Sid, we've been waiting for you.
We're gonna start a movie.

1366
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:01,968
- What kind of movie?
- You have to come and see.

1367
01:50:30,505 --> 01:50:34,217
Take a little walk
to the edge of town

1368
01:50:34,467 --> 01:50:38,221
Now, spread your wings and fly

1369
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:42,433
Don't the lights of the city
look so damn pretty

1370
01:50:42,683 --> 01:50:46,896
When you're flyin' so high

1371
01:50:47,146 --> 01:50:50,650
It's hard to know
about there down below

1372
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:55,821
The streets fade
They're swimmin'deep in blood

1373
01:50:56,072 --> 01:51:02,954
It seems to make me
groan and cry

1374
01:51:03,579 --> 01:51:06,916
You really wanna know
what's wrong with this land

1375
01:51:07,166 --> 01:51:12,839
Just scratch your head
with your red right hand

1376
01:51:14,382 --> 01:51:18,886
I'm talkin'about blood, babe

1377
01:51:19,136 --> 01:51:23,099
It's in your veins

1378
01:51:23,349 --> 01:51:26,936
Your mommy and daddy

1379
01:51:27,186 --> 01:51:30,857
They've got the same

1380
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:37,280
You're under the mirror
day after day

1381
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:41,242
You see a pretty face
crumblin' away

1382
01:51:41,492 --> 01:51:48,541
As you become
your mom and daddy

1383
01:51:48,666 --> 01:51:53,171
Scream once, scream twice
Now scream again

1384
01:51:53,421 --> 01:51:59,427
Cover that face
with your red right hand

1385
01:52:11,397 --> 01:52:15,943
So, is this the end

1386
01:52:16,194 --> 01:52:20,990
Forus, my friend

1387
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:28,706
So, is this the end

1388
01:52:28,956 --> 01:52:34,420
Forus, my friend

1389
01:52:37,089 --> 01:52:41,511
So, is this the end

1390
01:52:41,761 --> 01:52:47,225
Forus, my friend

1391
01:53:04,075 --> 01:53:10,873
Well as though we rise

1392
01:53:11,123 --> 01:53:16,671
As the day breaks the dawn

1393
01:53:16,921 --> 01:53:23,719
And as the moon hides the sun

1394
01:53:23,970 --> 01:53:27,890
Oh, the sun

1395
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:35,773
No more sorrow

1396
01:53:36,691 --> 01:53:42,405
All those crying days are gone

1397
01:53:42,655 --> 01:53:46,033
No more sorrow

1398
01:53:46,284 --> 01:53:49,078
Now it'sgone

1399
01:53:49,328 --> 01:53:52,331
Now it'sgone

1400
01:53:52,582 --> 01:53:56,752
Now it'sgone

1401
01:54:00,256 --> 01:54:04,927
So, is this the end

1402
01:54:05,178 --> 01:54:11,767
Forus, my friend

1403
01:54:14,854 --> 01:54:19,108
Spoke to my god today
Asked him why he'd gone away

1404
01:54:19,358 --> 01:54:23,404
Hitched on a rocket ride
into the sun

1405
01:54:23,654 --> 01:54:27,909
Said, son I got one for ya
Down there in California

1406
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:32,288
Just take a look around
at all you've done

1407
01:54:32,538 --> 01:54:35,666
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

1408
01:54:35,917 --> 01:54:41,047
You're a star like everyone

1409
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:45,468
Talked to my soul today
Couldn't keep my brain away

1410
01:54:45,718 --> 01:54:49,805
So I found a holiday
behind the sun

1411
01:54:50,056 --> 01:54:54,268
Took all the friends I could
Spun out in Hollywood

1412
01:54:54,519 --> 01:54:58,689
Hit up on a climate everyone

1413
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:02,068
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

1414
01:55:02,318 --> 01:55:07,698
You're a star like everyone

1415
01:55:08,407 --> 01:55:12,495
You could save the world

1416
01:55:12,745 --> 01:55:17,166
Could be shining on my pearl

1417
01:55:17,416 --> 01:55:21,462
You could save the world

1418
01:55:21,715 --> 01:55:27,010
Just might find your way

1419
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:30,680

1420
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:36,895
Shine

1421
01:55:42,945 --> 01:55:46,030
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

1422
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:52,120
You're a star like everyone

1423
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:56,495
You could save the world

1424
01:55:56,750 --> 01:56:00,875
Could be shinin' on my pearl

01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:05,380
You could save the world

1426
01:56:05,630 --> 01:56:09,845
Could be shinin' on my pearl

1427
01:56:10,095 --> 01:56:14,225

01:56:14,475 --> 01:56:19,730
Just might find your way
