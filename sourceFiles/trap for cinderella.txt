2
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,177
Micky, can you hear me?

3
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:20,259
Can you hear me?

4
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,343
Micky!

5
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,919
Try not to move.

6
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,636
Blink for "yes"
if you understand me.

7
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,675
I am Dr Muller.
I operated on you.

8
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,590
Do you remember
what happened to you?

9
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,502
Nothing at all?

10
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,800
Micky, that's your name.
Do you remember?

11
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,047
Are you in pain?

12
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,802
Shh. It's Ok.

13
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,672
When can I see myself?

14
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,511
You suffered
severe cranial fractures.

15
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:37,550
You required major reconstruction
to your face and jaw.

16
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,969
But you were lucky.

17
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,461
The tissue damage
could have been far more severe.

18
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,501
OK?

19
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,044
Oh, my God.

20
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,172
Who am I?

21
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,419
Your name is?

22
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,716
My name is Michelle Deane, Micky.

23
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,959
How old are you?

24
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,926
I'm 20 years old.

25
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,840
- Where do you live?
- London.

26
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:29,043
You make me say the same
stupid things over and over every day.

27
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,011
I can't stand it.

28
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,674
I want to get out of here.

29
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,215
You lost your parents aged nine.

30
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,756
In a car accident. You were unharmed.

31
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,881
Your Aunt Elinor
took care of you after that.

32
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,844
You spent your holidays
in the south of France.

33
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,590
Remember her?

34
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,634
- Where is she now?
- She passed away just before the fire.

35
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,047
So I'm alone.

36
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,920
No, you have many friends.

37
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,424
This is Julia, your aunt's PA.

38
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,385
She's known you
since you were a child.

39
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,593
Do you recognise her?

40
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,215
And these are some of your friends.

41
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,544
Do you remember them?

42
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,709
No.

43
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:50,421
Am I going away?
Who's taking me?

44
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,544
Julia, your guardian.

45
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,168
Micky.

46
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,502
Let me look at you.

47
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,794
Do you remember me?

48
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,590
No.

49
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,710
But I want to.

50
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,926
I've come to take you home.

51
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,959
When your parents died, your Aunt
Elinor asked me to look after you.

52
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,506
Whenever you weren't at school,
you stayed with me.

53
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,340
Do you remember
anything at all?

54
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,552
Just flashes.

55
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:11,002
- Like what?
- People, places.

56
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,173
I don't know who they are.

57
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,886
Sometimes I just see fire.

58
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,881
One of your aunt's many houses.

59
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,506
How bad was I when you found me?

60
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,708
The injuries on your face were so bad,
I thought you were dead.

61
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,002
Hello? It's Jake.

62
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,419
I hear she's back.

63
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,087
- She's really not ready yet.
- Well, is she there?

64
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,677
I'll tell her you called.
Goodbye, Jake.

65
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,295
I don't know
if I'm remembering or imagining.

66
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,002
Was he my boyfriend?

67
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,718
Jake? One of them.

68
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,677
- There was more than one?
- Of course!

69
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:51,921
- You were irresistible.
- Not any more.

70
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,050
- Who's this girl?
- Domenica, Do.

71
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,590
- Who is she?
- A friend.

72
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,631
Her mother was
your aunt's housekeeper.

73
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,173
- Can we call her?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

74
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:08,794
What about my other friends?

75
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,670
Your real friends will understand
that you need time.

76
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,762
What do you mean?

77
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,584
When you're 21,
you will inherit Elinor's entire estate.

78
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,463
- You should have told me.
- I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

79
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,177
I know nothing.
When are you going to realise?

80
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,795
- I don't even know who you are!
- I'm your friend.

81
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,294
I'm sorry.

82
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,002
Are you all right?

83
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,877
Yeah.

84
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,002
Yeah. Come on.

85
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,635
6 Fitzroy Square, please.

86
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,509
Micky!

87
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,219
I wasn't expecting to see you.
Why didn't you call?

88
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:08,500
Well, this is a surprise.
Please, sit down.

89
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,548
Tell me how you're doing.

90
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,214
Who are you?

91
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:19,088
I'm James Chance.
I was your aunt's lawyer.

92
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,633
I handle all Elinor's business.
Yes, this must be confusing for you.

93
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,424
I got sent a letter from this address.

94
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,087
This is from Jake.
He works here.

95
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,336
Micky, does Julia know you're here?

96
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,926
Please, let me call her.

97
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:37,010
You shouldn't be out
on your own so soon.

98
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,469
I'm all right. Thank you.

99
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,834
Jake.

100
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:51,340
It is Jake?

101
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,335
Micky.

102
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,632
It's great to see you.
What are you doing here?

103
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,877
Looking for you.

104
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,177
- I tried to get in touch.
- I know.

105
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,794
It's nice to meet you.

106
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,969
- I heard about everything and...
- Yeah.

107
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,585
My memory.

108
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,502
What are you doing now, Micky?

109
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,595
Do you want to go somewhere
and talk, get a drink?

110
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,752
Er...

111
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,877
What about my place?

112
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,260
OK.

113
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,296
Last time I saw you, you said
you never wanted to see me again.

114
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,545
I'm glad you changed your mind.

115
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,920
Yeah, well,
I only have your word for it.

116
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:54,090
So, I hear we were lovers.

117
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,881
On and off.

118
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,926
I used to have some keys to your flat.

119
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,340
- You should have them.
- Let me see.

120
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:10,590
- Where is it?
- Narpin Road.

121
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,169
Hoxton.

122
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,377
You can stay here if you want.

123
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,960
You look like a stranger to me.

124
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,587
I have nothing to go on.

125
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,551
Just how I feel.

126
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,045
Do you remember
anything at all?

127
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,839
Just flashes.

128
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,172
People, places.

129
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,626
- My name is Michelle Deane, Micky.
- How old are you?

130
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,423
I'm 21 years old.

131
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,965
- Where do you live?
- London. You make me say

132
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,461
the same stupid things
over and over every day.

133
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,426
Do you remember anything else?

134
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,131
I remember what you've told me.

135
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,548
I remember what you've told me.

136
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,878
- What is it?
- Oh, it still... It still hurts.

137
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,300
- Don't stop, it's OK.
- OK. Don't make me laugh.

138
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,877
Was I unfaithful?

139
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,176
Probably.

140
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,003
That was crap of me. I'm sorry.

141
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:38,301
I know...
But I suppose you're worth it.

142
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,966
You should have told me to fuck off.

143
00:16:58,292 --> 00:16:59,714
Tell me about Do.

144
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,794
She always got in the way.

145
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,502
Ah, you were jealous.

146
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,253
I was, yes.

147
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,882
What do you mean, "was"?
What changed?

148
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,460
Sorry?

149
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,427
You said you were jealous.

150
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,544
Why not now?

151
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,922
Julia didn't tell you?

152
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,543
What?

153
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,878
Micky, I'm sorry.

154
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,801
Do died in the fire.

155
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,210
Micky, what did they tell you?

156
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,339
I'd like some water.

157
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,551
Micky!

158
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,385
Wait!

159
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,343
Micky! Micky!

160
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,460
Dear Do

161
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,133
It's nice to talk to you
after, well, too many years.

162
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,424
It's a deep regret of mine
that I lost touch with you.

163
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,459
Elinor.

164
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,042
May 6th.
Today my life began again.

165
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:05,964
Excuse me.

166
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,169
Micky!

167
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:32,675
It's Do,
from our holidays in France.

168
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,251
Do!

169
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,002
Oh, my God!

170
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:48,262
I can't believe it.
I'm so pleased to see you.

171
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,549
- Have you been in London long?
- A year. I work in a bank.

172
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,340
I'm so pleased to see you too.

173
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,292
Listen, what are you doing now?
Do you want to get a coffee or a drink?

174
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:04,465
I can't. I've got to get back.

175
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,631
OK, um...

176
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,084
- Well, tonight, are you free?
- Yeah.

177
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,052
Yeah? OK.
Look, I'll give you my number.

178
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,377
Will you promise me you'll call me?

179
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,752
- Yeah.
- OK.

180
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:23,419
- Tonight, then.
- Tonight.

181
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,343
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

182
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,842
Hey, this is Micky.

183
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,427
Please leave a message.

184
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,794
Micky.

185
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,002
I thought you'd forgotten.

186
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,885
Where?

187
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,050
No, no, I don't know it.
But I can find it.

188
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,427
Yeah, OK. OK.

189
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,255
Yeah, bye. Bye.

190
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,636
Hey. Come in. Come in.

191
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,094
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

192
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:07,052
- Cheers. Did you find it OK?
- Yeah.

193
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:09,169
Yeah? Oh, hang on.

194
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,968
Hello?

195
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,130
Yeah.

196
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,469
No. No, now's not good.

197
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:17,926
I know.

198
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,711
I know, but something came up.

199
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,130
Yeah.

200
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,424
I'm sorry. I was taking photographs.

201
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:46,842
I have a deadline.
I have to finish them tonight.

202
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,960
I'll call you soon, OK?

203
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:58,383
- I shouldn't drink when I'm working.
- Do you want me to leave?

204
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,800
No, you can sleep here if you like.

205
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,922
You came!

206
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,426
You look gorgeous.

207
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,668
Look at you.

208
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,341
- Do you want to come for a dance?
- Um... yeah.

209
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,297
OK, one, two, three...

210
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,418
Cheers.

211
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,051
- Hey.
- Hey.

212
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,215
- This is Jake. He's my lawyer.
- Oh, really?

213
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,335
I thought I was
the song-and-dance man.

214
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:10,462
Hi.
I'm Domenica, Do.

215
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:12,756
So you're the long-lost friend?

216
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:17,085
I hate my hair. I want to cut it all off.
Do you remember that game?

217
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:20,178
If there was one thing
you could change about yourself...

218
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:23,262
- Most guys want to be better endowed.
- Go and get drinks.

219
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,630
All right?

220
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,297
Come here.

221
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:34,135
So, what would you change, Do?

222
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,130
- Gosh, I don't know where to start.
- I think I'd change my nose.

223
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,924
I'd like one like yours.

224
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,673
God, it's been so long.
We were really close.

225
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,671
- Do you remember?
- Yeah. I kept all the photos.

226
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,465
- Really?
- They're at my flat.

227
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,301
No way.

228
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:56,045
I could go get them, if you like.

229
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:59,501
- What, now?
- Yeah. Why not?

230
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,004
- That's crazy.
- You'll still be here, right?

231
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:12,293
Clapham, please.

232
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,794
You can't get rid of me that easily.

233
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,961
Anywhere here is fine, thanks.

234
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,711
- Wait here.
- No, I want to come with you.

235
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:33,007
No, no, no, no.
It's a terrible place, really. Wait.

236
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,968
I'm coming up.

237
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,589
Ah!

238
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,419
What happened to you after?

239
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,752
We moved back to England.

240
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,969
My mother got a job
in the West Country,

241
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,881
miles from anywhere.

242
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,300
And I came up to London
after she died.

243
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,511
I'm sorry you had to go away.

244
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,335
Are you still in touch with your dad?

245
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,344
He killed himself.

246
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,422
I'm so...

247
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,048
I'm sorry. I've...

248
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,589
I've been rubbish.

249
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:44,177
I should have tried harder
to stay in touch.

250
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,172
It's all right.

251
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:01,252
Look at that.

252
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,594
Micky, stop! I can't swim!

253
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,094
I can't swim!

254
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:45,587
Do! Let go!
Let go. I can't breathe.

255
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,966
- Micky, it's too deep!
- Don't!

256
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,174
Let go!

257
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:56,966
Let go! I can't breathe!

258
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,548
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

259
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,089
Micky, what have you done?

260
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:09,544
- Do!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

261
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:12,637
- I didn't mean it!
- It's all right. I'm fine.

262
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,378
Micky! Micky!

263
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,798
Micky!

264
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,294
Micky!

265
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:24,714
Micky!

266
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:39,216
- Please! Why can't I stay?
- Do!

267
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,544
Micky!

268
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,799
- Do!
- Micky!

269
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:55,421
Do! Don't leave me!

270
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:19,171
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I have to go to work.

271
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:24,467
- Don't go.
- But I've got to pay my rent.

272
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:27,757
Yeah? You can move in with me.

273
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:44,667
OK, yeah, but I told you
I can't talk right now, so...

274
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,420
Yeah, OK, listen...
No, I'll give you a call back later.

275
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:49,089
But I have to go now. OK.

276
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,881
Bye.

277
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,628
My aunt. She doesn't even pretend
to like me any more.

278
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,593
She always calls at the wrong time.

279
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,551
And I'm going to be late again.

280
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:00,090
Have you seen my bag? OK.

281
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,427
- I'll see you tonight.
- Bye.

282
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,252
- Hello?
- Hello? Micky?

283
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,628
No, it...

284
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,673
Elinor.

285
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:31,591
Hi. It's Do,
Domenica Law.

286
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:34,131
Do? Oh, my goodness!

287
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,094
How long have you been
in touch with Micky?

288
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,711
Um... Oh, just a few days.

289
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:42,797
I see.

290
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,879
- Elinor?
- Yes, I'm here.

291
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,549
Listen, I'll get Micky to call you.

292
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,341
It's so good
to speak to you again.

293
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,631
Good evening, Do.

294
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,635
What do you mean?

295
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,629
It's all right. Don't worry.

296
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:04,675
- I need to go.
- No, please, Do.

297
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,631
You're Micky now.

298
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,585
Please, let me go.

299
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:35,420
It's our secret.

300
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:37,465
Do? Do?

301
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,377
Today my life began again.

302
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:45,464
It's our secret.

303
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,005
Monday, May...

304
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,254
We sat in her apartment together
for the rest of the afternoon.

305
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,753
Nobody understands what we share.

306
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,673
Saturday June 2nd.

307
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,339
She doesn't need him.

308
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,880
She only needs me.

309
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,843
Nobody understands me like she does.

310
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,211
I'd love to be like her.

311
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:03,755
She only needs me.

312
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,798
Nobody understands what we share.

313
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:07,760
Can't sleep here, love.

314
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:47,462
Upstairs, through the double doors,
first on the left.

315
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,261
Please vacate your room by 12,
Miss Law.

316
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,885
- What did you call me?
- Miss Law.

317
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,047
Isn't it?

318
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:25,091
Today was another glorious day.

319
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:39,177
I can't believe she wants
to spend so much time with me.

320
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,877
It looks OK.

321
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,635
Nobody understands me like she does.

322
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,299
Nobody knows what we share.

323
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,051
Bye. Don't hate me.

324
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:40,464
Sorry I'm late, babe.

325
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,964
I'll call you, Do, OK?

326
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,505
See you.

327
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,217
Hi.

328
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,506
Ohh!

329
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:18,626
Thanks.

330
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:39,381
Nobody knows what we share.

331
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,594
Yeah, fine.

332
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,968
Dear Do.

333
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,836
A small something.
I hope it helps.

334
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,717
Elinor.

335
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,505
Dear Elinor.

336
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:20,424
It was so wonderful to talk to you
after all this time

337
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:23,216
and I was so delighted
to receive your letter.

338
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,462
I felt so stupid after your call
because I wanted to say so much,

339
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:29,632
but I just didn't know
where to start.

340
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:33,011
And I can give you news of Micky.

341
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:35,548
She's so busy
she doesn't have the opportunity

342
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,886
to write as much as she'd like to.

343
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,343
How's that for you?

344
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:53,676
My dearest Do,

345
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:56,841
thank you for your kind
and considerate letter.

346
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,381
It was such a pleasant surprise
to hear your voice

347
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,219
after so many years.

348
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:12,044
You look good.

349
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,301
Lighten up.

350
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:24,008
- Oh, are you guys going?
- Bye, see you later.

351
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,216
I'm sorry, madam.
Have you got another card?

352
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:34,010
I'll do it.

353
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:38,756
- Don't be stupid, you're broke.
- Oh, is that why he never pays?

354
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:42,049
- Am I hearing this?
- It's just something I've picked up on.

355
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,589
You're the fucking parasite.

356
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:46,587
- How can you say that?
- Well, why do you put up with it?

357
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:50,292
You don't give a shit about money
but your friends are obsessed with it.

358
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:51,794
What's wrong with you?

359
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:53,885
Do you know what?
I need to go.

360
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,001
Jake!

361
00:44:56,125 --> 00:45:00,301
Next time it would be nice
to see you without her around.

362
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:11,043
Get off.

363
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,754
- Are you happy now?
- I'm sorry.

364
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,170
- I'm sorry.
- You always say you're sorry.

365
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:06,294
You say it too much.

366
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,627
I love you.

367
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:13,960
Do you?

368
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:17,627
Do you really?

369
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,260
Is this what you want?

370
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:31,711
- Get off me.
- Is that what you want, Do?

371
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,255
Get off.

372
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,377
Happy now?

373
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:52,880
Get out!

374
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,338
Dear Elinor, I told you
I'd write with news of Micky.

375
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:22,132
She certainly lives her life to the full,

376
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,628
maybe too much sometimes.

377
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,549
She and her crowd stay out all night
most of the time.

378
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:30,511
I can't pretend
I don't worry about her sometimes.

379
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:32,960
Hopefully I'll get to meet you soon

380
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,256
and I'll be able to thank you in person

381
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:37,753
for all those precious summers.

382
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:40,845
With warmest best wishes, Do.'

383
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,592
What happened?

384
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:47,756
The diary entries just stop.

385
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,924
If I'm Do, then why did you tell me
I was Micky?

386
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:54,545
I arrived the morning
after one of your fights.

387
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,802
I could see it in your face.

388
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,550
It was clear you'd crossed a line.
There was no going back.

389
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:06,927
You just didn't realise it.

390
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:10,342
Elinor's health has taken a turn
for the worse since you last saw her.

391
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:12,051
She's very ill in hospital.

392
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:14,841
I'm sorry, but they give her
no more than a few weeks.

393
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,508
She wants you to visit her
in France right away.

394
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:20,502
Both of you.
Do, please pack a bag.

395
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:24,004
- No, don't listen to her, Do.
- She wants to see Do too.

396
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:27,208
- You can't just order her around.
- Pack your bag, please.

397
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:28,710
I'm not going. She hates me.

398
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:33,006
- You bitch!
- Micky!

399
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:34,547
Micky, stop it!

400
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:35,668
Micky!

401
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:44,302
I'm just going to go to the bathroom.

402
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,343
I don't believe you.

403
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,881
Because your mind is blocking it out.

404
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,253
I'm not Do.

405
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,377
I don't feel like her.

406
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:27,210
Do died in the accident.

407
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,170
Thank you for inviting me.

408
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:37,251
So... what do you want
to talk to me about?

409
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,127
I thought you needed cheering up.

410
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:41,926
No, I'm fine.

411
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:44,295
What, living under Micky's shadow?

412
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,468
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- Sorry.

413
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:50,427
I was just reminded
of how it was for me.

414
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:53,170
I don't know
how I put up with it for so long.

415
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:57,172
- First Elinor and then Micky.
- You two don't get on, do you?

416
00:49:57,292 --> 00:50:01,718
No. Micky is irresistible.

417
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:05,883
But she's destroying herself.
Be careful you don't end up getting hurt.

418
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,422
I'm her friend.

419
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:09,260
So she won't hurt me.

420
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,800
No, you're probably right.
Just a little warning.

421
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,219
I've read your letters to Elinor.

422
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:30,547
- You've read my letters?
- Sorry. It's part of my job.

423
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:33,876
- How dare you?
- Do...

424
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,630
I know why you returned
the cheque to Elinor.

425
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,128
You mustn't feel ashamed.

426
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,548
I really don't think
this was such a good idea.

427
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,511
I just think it is so unfair.

428
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:49,632
Why do we not get
the life we deserve?

429
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,424
When I was 18, I was working
in one of Elinor's factories

430
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:54,044
and she saw something in me.

431
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:56,885
She offered me everything.

432
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,545
Then along came Micky.

433
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,969
Deep down you're just like me.

434
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,926
You know you should have a better life.

435
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:14,716
Persuade Micky
to come to the south of France.

436
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:16,551
It will be the best for both of you.

437
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,592
I've...

438
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:21,552
I've moved back to my own flat.

439
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,917
Now, when you both get there,
give me a call.

440
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:38,840
I can help you.

441
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,801
- Pack your bags.
- What?

442
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:09,045
You need your swimsuit
and your passport.

443
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,293
Passport?

444
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:12,795
I thought maybe we could go
to the south of France.

445
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:15,261
I need a break
and we could see Elinor.

446
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:17,969
- Yeah, but I thought you...
- Yeah, I changed my mind.

447
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:22,213
Look, she'd love you to come
and we can fly to Paris, hire a car,

448
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,801
take the scenic route.

449
00:52:23,917 --> 00:52:25,089
Come on.

450
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,460
I'll help you pack.

451
00:52:56,292 --> 00:53:00,422
I just hate myself when I'm with her,
the way she makes me act.

452
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:03,341
Why do you put up with it, then?

453
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:04,710
Oh...

454
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,835
It's complicated.

455
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,877
Julia brought me up as much as anyone.

456
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:13,886
At a certain point,
Elinor just gave up on me.

457
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:19,135
Change the music, DJ.

458
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:26,127
So, what did Jake say
about us coming away?

459
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,300
- Haven't spoken to him.
- Are you going to stay with him?

460
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,215
If he wants me enough.

461
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:47,049
You must be shattered.
Pull in here.

462
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:00,544
Will this do?

463
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,084
WOW!

464
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:50,300
Christ, if you'd driven a few more feet,
we would have...

465
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:51,919
Shit!

466
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,126
WOW!

467
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,547
Come on.

468
00:55:24,417 --> 00:55:26,419
- She's ready.
- Thank you.

469
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:53,044
Hello, Elinor.

470
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,460
Hi, Elinor.

471
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,585
It's Do, Elinor.

472
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:27,798
I'm not Micky.

473
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:31,171
I'm Micky. I'm here.

474
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:34,339
Bonjour.

475
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,960
You must be Do.

476
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:41,170
- Bonjour.
- Ca va?

477
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,465
She's sleeping.

478
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:52,925
- Micky! Ca va?
- Yvette! Comment ca va?

479
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:55,386
- Ca va bien?
- Ca va bien.

480
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,047
I'm pleased to see you.

481
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:03,044
Do, come on.

482
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:07,129
Let's just dump our stuff here
and go straight to the beach.

483
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,960
Kick your feet.

484
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,505
Arms out.

485
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:35,584
Hello.

486
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:39,042
I'm not going to call again
so please listen.

487
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,970
I just want you to be honest with
yourself about what you want.

488
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:45,755
I want her.

489
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:49,136
She's ruined your life once already.

490
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:55,088
Micky told your mother
about your father's affair with Elinor.

491
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:59,626
Surely that must have something
to do with why he committed suicide.

492
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,255
Micky!

493
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:15,960
Don't leave me!

494
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:28,253
She'll never love you
in the way you want her to.

495
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:34,210
It's not in her nature.
Now, listen carefully to me.

496
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:37,090
This is what you have to do.

497
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:43,634
You were gone ages yesterday.
I went to the beach.

498
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,548
Was there any action in the village?

499
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:49,465
Party central.

500
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:55,010
Right, it's empty.

501
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,251
- My turn.
- No, no, no.

502
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:02,589
Shit.

503
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,584
- Is everything OK?
- Yes, thank you.

504
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,710
I'll do it.

505
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,005
Do?

506
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:49,292
What took you so long?
I gave up on you. Anything wrong?

507
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:52,500
No. It's just the sun.
It's knocked me out.

508
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:21,585
I wish the sun
would just stop right there,

509
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:23,836
not move any more.

510
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:27,961
Then I'd just lay
like this forever.

511
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:34,132
What about you, Do?

512
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,594
Do you think about the future?

513
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:40,667
Gosh, it's too hot
to think about anything.

514
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:43,011
I don't want to think about it either.

515
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:51,842
Do you want to go out tonight?
There's a party on some guy's boat.

516
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:55,007
- What guy? A friend?
- I don't know. It's just some guy.

517
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:08,007
You should learn to swim.

518
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:51,049
Come on.
Let's go to the boat! Come on!

519
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:56,591
- We go to the boat. You come?
- Yeah. Are you coming?

520
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,131
Er, I thought you had a big boat.

521
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:16,379
- Well, that's his boat.
- Oh.

522
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:19,460
We don't need to bring her, do we?

523
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:33,715
- What are you doing here?
- Micky, I'm sorry.

524
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:36,427
I've got some bad news
about your aunt.

525
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:39,465
She passed away yesterday.

526
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:46,177
C'est fini. Come on.

527
01:09:00,542 --> 01:09:03,716
She's quiet now.

528
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:05,835
Tell me what to do.

529
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,377
Not here.

530
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:13,260
On 4th July, your birthday,

531
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:16,299
you'll go out for dinner,
have a little celebration.

532
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:19,842
That will seem natural afterwards.
That's the night it will happen.

533
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:21,960
Your plan will never work.

534
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:26,549
The fire will cause so much damage
they'll assume it was the boiler.

535
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:29,511
They'll never discover
the disconnected gas pipe.

536
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,173
If I die, I'll deserve it.

537
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:37,215
You have to start the fire at 1:00am.

538
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:41,133
We need to agree a time
so that I can be the first to arrive.

539
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,252
We'll never get away with this.

540
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:47,882
What about Yvette?
She'll recognise me.

541
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,253
That will be impossible.

542
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,218
We'll go to Switzerland.

543
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:55,667
They're very discreet.
They have the best surgical facilities.

544
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,335
What are you saying?

545
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:01,007
You will be Micky.

546
01:10:03,792 --> 01:10:05,294
Do you want me to change my face?

547
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:08,547
I know.

548
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,547
But it will be worth it.

549
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,877
Sometimes you get a chance,

550
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,880
and if you seize it in that moment,
you can change your life forever.

551
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,334
If you let it slip... it will be gone.

552
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,880
Come with me.

553
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,377
- Look.
- Christ, we'll be out of it.

554
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,470
- I've got to drive.
- Just leave the car. Come on.

555
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:09,960
- All right, just one.
- OK.

556
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:11,084
Ready?

557
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,377
Right, let's go.

558
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,252
No, don't make me...

559
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,844
- Can we leave now?
- It's just getting started.

560
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:34,588
Really? It's the third time
he's started to tell that story

561
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,551
and it's not getting any funnier.

562
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,886
OK, five minutes.

563
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,798
Please.

564
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:42,919
OK.

565
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:56,709
A la tienne!

566
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,752
Come on, get into bed.

567
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:38,342
It worked, better than expected.

568
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:42,757
Your poor face,
it was unrecognisable after the fall.

569
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:45,845
But even that worked to our advantage.

570
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,928
- And the amnesia...
- Oh, my God.

571
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:53,752
What have I done?
How could I have gone through with it?

572
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:56,503
- Do, calm yourself.
- I'm going to the police.

573
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:58,878
Why? You've got everything
you ever wanted.

574
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,128
I didn't want this.

575
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:05,587
- I don't want this.
- The old Micky is gone.

576
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:07,130
You're Micky now.

577
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,469
And if the lawyer believes you,
as he does,

578
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,836
then everyone will.

579
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:14,802
We'll go back to Elinor's
in the south of France.

580
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,219
We'll wait for the reading of the will.

581
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:39,886
Here. You're safe now.

582
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,877
Who are you?

583
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,298
1963 E-Type.

584
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:10,169
It's a beauty, isn't it?

585
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:15,417
I'd buy it off you
if I had a spare 100,000 euros.

586
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:17,840
But, then, you don't need the money.

587
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:22,136
- Let's get in.
- What do you want?

588
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,460
To tell you a story.

589
01:18:47,042 --> 01:18:49,044
This is a private beach.

590
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:55,210
I'm going for a swim.

591
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:25,086
Actually, I'm not here for the sun.

592
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,710
I know what you're here for.

593
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:31,921
Your friend stopped
at the café.

594
01:19:32,042 --> 01:19:34,841
I got interested
when she wanted to call England.

595
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:41,428
Excuse me.
I'd like to make a call to London.

596
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:43,795
- Lost your phone?
- How did you guess?

597
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:46,880
I listened in.

598
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,344
She's ruined your life
once already.'

599
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:51,460
What does this have
to do with me?

600
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,426
They've got some sort of a plan.

601
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,126
Against you.

602
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,210
She wrote something on a pad.

603
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:10,042
Remember.
The upstairs bathroom.

604
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:11,384
Clarissa.

605
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,422
It's blank.

606
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:25,090
She presses too hard
when she writes.

607
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,751
It says...

608
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:30,669
"Clarissa upstairs bathroom."

609
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:41,925
How much?

610
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:47,505
A thousand?

611
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:59,625
Meet me at the tabac,
tomorrow at 11:00.

612
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:13,590
You were gone for ages yesterday.

613
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,960
I went to the beach.

614
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:23,342
- Was there any action in the village?
- Party central.

615
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:26,551
Right, it's empty.

616
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:29,136
- My turn.
- No, no, no. I'll go.

617
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,842
Do?

618
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,006
What took you so long?
I gave up on you. Anything wrong?

619
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:44,799
No. It's just the sun.
It's knocked me out.

620
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:02,169
There's 500.

621
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:05,627
Where is the rest?

622
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:09,755
If what you have to say is interesting,
you'll get the rest.

623
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:13,334
All they have to do is loosen the joint

624
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:16,917
and in a closed room
with a naked flame...

625
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,585
Where is the rest of my money?

626
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,794
That was the rest.

627
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:45,209
You're lucky to have a taste of me.
I'm worth much more than that.

628
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:48,502
I don't need you any more.

629
01:22:49,042 --> 01:22:50,715
You owe me.

630
01:22:53,917 --> 01:22:56,761
You should learn to swim.

631
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:23,792
- Why should I believe you?
- We had a deal, but you killed her.

632
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:27,126
So the deal is different
and now I want more money.

633
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:29,752
Let me go. Please.

634
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,718
You're not in a position to bargain.

635
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:36,005
How much do you want?

636
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:38,709
100,000.

637
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:43,214
100,000?

638
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,467
OK.

639
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:55,881
Just remember,
one phone call will finish you.

640
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:14,795
Do you remember
what happened to you?'

641
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:17,093
Micky, that's your name.

642
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,419
Do you remember?

643
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:21,714
Miss Law.

644
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:23,005
Isn't it?

645
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:26,215
Micky, that's your name.

646
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:28,381
Good evening, Do.

647
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:31,552
Who am I?

648
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:33,465
Domenica... Micky... Do.

649
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:51,836
We've been found out.

650
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:54,632
The boy from the cafe,
says he's heard it all.

651
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,844
- How could he?
- I don't know.

652
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,676
Yvette's seen him
snooping around.

653
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:00,590
What did you tell him?

654
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:03,757
- Well, I didn't tell him the truth.
- The truth?

655
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:07,882
I didn't tell him that
you plotted with Do to kill Micky.

656
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,048
Just as well.

657
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:13,011
Tomorrow is Micky's 21st birthday.

658
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:18,006
I'm meeting Chance in London
and at last we'll read the will.

659
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,344
I'm sorry
not to have seen Micky.

660
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:35,302
The rest is doing her good.

661
01:25:35,417 --> 01:25:38,717
I was surprised that
you were not made an executor,

662
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:41,006
or a beneficiary, indeed.

663
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:43,378
Perhaps she'd already made
provision for you.

664
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:47,050
There's been an arrangement
in place for some time.

665
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:48,510
A modest pension.

666
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:50,844
- I didn't tell him the truth.'
- The truth?'

667
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:53,928
I didn't tell him that
you plotted with Do to kill Micky.

668
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:55,385
Just...

669
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,549
There had been no change to the will
drafted five years ago,

670
01:26:02,667 --> 01:26:07,924
just this, the last detail,
to be opened on Micky's birthday.

671
01:26:08,042 --> 01:26:09,794
Happy birthday to Micky,
by the way.

672
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:56,756
- Where's my money?
- You'll get your money.

673
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:58,343
Let's go for a drive.

674
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,049
It's yours
if you can keep your mouth shut.

675
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:21,211
You said it's worth 100,000.

676
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:23,635
You could sell it if you want.

677
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,752
Julia?

678
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:59,127
Julia?

679
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:07,507
Hello? Julia?

680
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:11,585
Are you there?

681
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:17,509
Julia?

682
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,877
Is anyone here?

683
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:32,169
Hello?

684
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:51,965
The old lady had the last word.

685
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,969
I would never have guessed.

686
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:01,710
What do you mean?

687
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:03,551
She left everything to you.

688
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:06,341
- To me?
- To you.

689
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:10,550
She left everything to
Domenica Law.

690
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:14,753
All this for nothing.

691
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:18,591
- And Micky dead.
- Micky knew, Julia.

692
01:29:19,417 --> 01:29:21,260
No.

693
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:23,002
No, she knew nothing.

694
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:29,426
Do, you wouldn't be here
if she'd known.

695
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:31,172
She...

696
01:29:31,292 --> 01:29:33,511
She would have stopped you.

697
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:45,385
You can't...

698
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:50,049
- You can't be Micky!
- It's over.

699
01:29:53,542 --> 01:29:57,843
I recorded you admitting to murder.
I sent the tape to Chance.

700
01:30:19,125 --> 01:30:21,469
Let go! I can't breathe!

701
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:03,007
I'm so sorry.

702
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:20,551
Run!

703
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:23,259
Come with me.

704
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:25,252
- Come with me!
- No! No!

705
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:26,547
No!

706
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:36,422
