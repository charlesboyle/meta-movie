de Gaulle's ultimatum

343
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,581
affect your philanthropic
work, ma'am?

344
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:45,081
Oh, I think we'll all find out it's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

345
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:47,855
When will you start on
Marnie, Your Highness?

346
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:49,998
I'm sorry?

347
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,623
Look magazine.

348
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:55,623
We received a copy of your press
release today from Universal Pictures.

349
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:57,831
"Princess Grace has
accepted to appear

350
00:25:57,832 --> 00:26:00,623
during her summer vacation
in the motion picture Marnie,

351
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:04,735
to be made by Mr Alfred Hitchcock
and shot in the United States."

352
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,781
Are you going back to
Hollywood, Your Highness?

353
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,748
No, no.

(FLASH BULBS)

355
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:14,623
<i>Hollywood rocked,
and the world as well,</i>

356
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:17,331
<i>as Academy Award-winning
actress Grace Kelly</i>

357
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:21,373
<i>has been announced to star in Alfred
Hitchcock's new picture, Marnie.</i>

for the State of Monaco?</i>

361
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:32,108
No, no, no. Focus on
the bloody birds.

362
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:36,693
Hello?

363
00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:39,689
Yes, of course. Put her through.

364
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,498
Grace?

365
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,290
Hitch! The studio said
they would wait. That...

366
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,028
The press release
came from the palace.

367
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,706
The studio only published a response.

368
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,748
Are you sure?

369
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:56,123
Yes, I told Wasserman
I'd leave Universal

370
00:26:56,124 --> 00:26:58,648
if there was any monkey business.

371
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:02,623
It's going to be tricky now.

372
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:04,665
I'll need some more time.

373
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,415
Can you wait?

374
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,456
Of course, darling.

375
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:13,565
The world needs Grace Kelly
back on the big screen now.

376
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:16,941
Hitch, thank you.

377
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:26,206
"The fact that wife Grace Kelly
is returning to her movie career,

378
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:27,831
no matter what the reason,

379
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:32,229
is indicative that in some ways, something
has gone wrong with her marriage."

380
00:27:32,582 --> 00:27:34,540
Why do they write such lies?

381
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,998
Try to avoid what Hedda
Hopper's been writing.

382
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,831
I think she's been after your
obituary for a while, now.

383
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:43,873
The bigger question... is how did the
release get out from Mr Cornet's office?

384
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:45,206
Yes.

385
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,373
Well, I have the only
key to the bureau.

386
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,081
And only one other person
knew where I put the release.

387
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,748
- How dare you, Mr Cornet?
- A mistake may have happened.

388
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:55,748
There are certain things about
which I do not make mistakes.

389
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:57,623
Maybe it wasn't a mistake.

390
00:27:57,624 --> 00:27:59,915
Don't play that game
with me, young lady.

391
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:02,440
OK, that is enough. Thank you.

392
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:08,030
I really don't think this was an
accident, Tuck. Somebody leaked it.

393
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:11,748
- Why would they do this to me?
- This isn't about you, Grace.

394
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:15,040
Somebody is using you to light
a fire under Ray's problem.

395
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,206
This is all about how
de Gaulle reacts.

396
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:20,373
(SIGHS) Why does everything
have to be so complicated?

397
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:22,447
Listen to me.

398
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:27,415
In 15 minutes, Ray is going to ask de
Gaulle to come to the negotiating table.

399
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:31,331
If he even suspects there's
a French spy in the palace,

400
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:36,357
he's going to reach into the phone and
punch de Gaulle right on the nose.

401
00:28:36,957 --> 00:28:40,206
Is there anybody on your
staff you trust unequivocally?

402
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:43,311
Phyllis. I hand-picked her.

403
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:47,081
All right, get her and conduct
your own investigation.

404
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:49,248
At all costs,
Ray mustn't be troubled.

405
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:52,188
RAINIER:
Ray mustn't be troubled by what?

406
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:56,206
Altesse was wondering whether
we should fire Mr Cornet.

407
00:28:56,207 --> 00:29:00,706
It seems the Press Department's rather
messed up the Hitchcock announcement.

408
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,748
Well, I did say it was a risk.

409
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:05,273
You did say you'd manage it.

410
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:09,731
You should see to the children.

411
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,581
- Hold on tight, Oliver!
- Giddy up!

412
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:14,831
Come on, push!

413
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:17,439

You're gonna dive in and get it.

419

The first one to catch
it is the winner.

420
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:31,123
- Yes.
- Off you go.

421
00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:32,498
Right.

- There we go.
- Sure.

was Madge's fault too.

MAN: What time? 7.30?

516
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:18,290
My hair?

517
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,998
Who told you to cut it that short?

518
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,623
WOMAN: I'm not gonna
hang around much longer.

519
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:24,998
We are still in 1962, right?

520
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:26,665
The year has nothing to do with it.

521
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:28,998
What? I think Grace's
hair looks very elegant.

522
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:31,790
- It looks dreadful.
- It's the model look.

523
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:34,998
- She's a modern woman.
- She isn't. She's the Princess of Monaco.

524
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:38,373
Oh, come on, Ray! You can't be
the great moderniser one minute...

525
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:40,040
Call Hitchcock!

That you're permanently
retiring from acting.

529
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:49,248
- Why? Because de Gaulle says so?
- Because I say so.

530
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:51,873
- That's not your decision to make.
- I'm your husband.

531
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:54,480
I won't do it, Ray.

532
00:34:57,582 --> 00:34:59,748
I didn't make you marry me.

533
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:02,248
- I didn't make you come here.
- Ray, this is absolutely...

534
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:05,165
What is it that Hollywood
can give you that I can't?

535
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,123
Ray, it's just a movie.

536
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:09,730
You were just an actress.

537
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:17,540
Have you thought that this
might not be about a movie?

538
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:21,581
Have you? Have you thought that de Gaulle
is looking for any excuse to take Monaco?

539
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:23,623
Even if it means turning
you against me?

540
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:26,123
Have you? No! Because you
don't listen and you don't think.

541
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,998
Everybody tip-toes around you while you
blow this way and that with indecision,

542
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,665
too afraid to say how you really feel

543
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:35,197
and too paralysed with the fear you
might just be in over your head.

544
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:38,737

I believe in "happily ever after".

what my father told the press?

559
00:36:56,624 --> 00:37:00,290
"I always thought it would be her sister
Peggy because anything Grace could do,

Peggy could do better."

That I'd rather be an actress
than be his ticket in.

563
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:19,938

was a disappointment.

have been a failure as a Princess.

00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:33,480
There's consequence.

581
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,415
When people dream of
marrying royalty,

582
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:42,864
they very rarely comprehend
what it really means.

583
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,748
And you have to add to that

away from anything you know.

00:38:56,874 --> 00:38:59,480
And you're still here.

589
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:03,998
This is a heartless kingdom.

00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:07,731
Ray needs me and he needs you.

591
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:11,814
It doesn't feel that way.

592
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:15,490
You scare him, don't you?

593
00:39:16,082 --> 00:39:20,498
You give a damn, and you're forcing
him to step out of his uniform.

594
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:23,105
He's just not ready yet.

I don't know how I'm gonna
keep living with him.

597
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:33,915
I don't know how I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life

598
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,819
in this place where I can't be me.

599
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:40,522

Grace Kelly, movie star?

601
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:46,665
You invented her.

602
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:52,331
You learned a certain kind of walk and
you perfected a certain kind of accent.

603
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:54,290
And you did it beautifully.

604
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,956
But now you're just a housewife
with two bratty kids

605
00:39:57,957 --> 00:40:00,812
watching a rerun of your wedding day.

606
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:04,314
It's not why you came here, Grace.

607
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:14,025

greatest role of your life:

and 137 more titles
that come with it.

00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:29,939
God help you.

612
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:33,772
You make it sound so easy.

613
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,956

616
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:49,356
That's a fairytale, Grace.
It's not real life.

617
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:52,165
And it's not real love.

618
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:56,775
Real love is... is obligation.

619
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,858
At some point every
fairy tale must end.

620
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:06,581
But you mustn't do this for
your father or for me,

621
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:11,061
you must do it for yourself,

Count Fernando D'Aillieres,
at your service.

657
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:01,855
A marriage in crisis...

658
00:44:01,957 --> 00:44:06,531
A princess far away from
home faces challenges

659
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:09,956
that are usually
impossible to overcome.

660
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:12,248
Well, that's very reassuring, Count.

661
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:16,609
I'm a protocol expert,
not a marriage counsellor.

662
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:22,271
But my duty is first and
foremost to Monaco.

663
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:24,290
Well, the um...

00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:27,194

the protocol...

665
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,081
I want to know it all.

666
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:31,873
You mean you're not
familiar with them already?

667
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:35,322
Nobody gave me a handbook
when I got married, Count.

668
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,063
It's not just a question
of knowing it. I...

669
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,956
Well, really, I want to become it.

670
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:43,651
Ah...

671
00:44:44,957 --> 00:44:47,415
Count, public opinion is
completely against me.

672
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:49,915
The people of Monaco don't
see me as their Princess.

673
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:53,456
I made a commitment with the whole world
watching, and for the sake of my children,

674
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,064

1115

told me that I should pray.

make it, I would never be ungrateful.

why did I leave Hollywood?

01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:08,645
because I fell in love
with a charming prince.

A man who has inspired me to see
the world with enough compassion

1124
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:20,568
that I may want to do something about
all of the unfair things that I see in it.

its language and...

exist if we really want them to,

1145

if we are prepared
to work hard enough.

1146
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:02,206

1147
01:27:02,207 --> 01:27:08,156
that the world will not always
be full of hatred and conflict if...

1151
01:27:21,082 --> 01:27:23,606
And in a way that is why...

1152
01:27:24,582 --> 01:27:27,106
That is why I am Monaco.

1160
01:27:58,374 --> 01:28:01,540
But it wouldn't be real life,
or it wouldn't be the fairy tale,

1161

if there wasn't someone trying
to destroy it, or crush it,

1162

or simply because they can.

it's their right to do so.

away our guns and our politics
