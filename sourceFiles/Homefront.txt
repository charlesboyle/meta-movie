1
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,265
They're in.

2
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,878
<i>This will make me happy.</i>

3
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,802
<i>How much should we cook?</i>

4
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,247
This batch will yield 30 pounds.

5
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,372
Move, tweak.

6
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,942
Are you fucking kidding me? Don't
be lighting that shit up in here.

7
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,554
Take it outside, Jojo.

8
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,491
All right.

9
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,382
Deal we had was 50
keys by a plane, JT.

10
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,427
Your guy gets held up at Port
Arthur, that is not my problem.

11
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,325
Danny T will appreciate that.

12
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,791
Everything set, Dalton?
Yeah, all good.

13
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,293
Same plane, same pilot, same price.
Good.

14
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,895
Fuck this half-ass plane.

15
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,396
We have 20 hardcore motherfuckers

16
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,498
who can drive this shit to Tucson.

17
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,178
Well, my way is the safe way.

18
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,671
Your call, Danny.

19
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:28,619
Look, you're my kid, but
we're doing it Dalton's way.

20
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,844
Everybody, let's start
packing this shit up.

21
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,512
We're out of here in 30 minutes.
Let's go.

22
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,853
Let's roll, boys.

23
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,864
Go, go, go.

24
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,039
- Go, go, go.
- Get your hands up.

25
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,945
We need to go.
We need to go.

26
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,374
DEA! Show me your hands!

27
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,843
Don't move. Don't move.
Show me your hands!

28
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,887
Get 'em up! Get on the ground!

29
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,515
Jesus Christ. Somebody give
me a 20 on my agent inside.

30
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,837
- Don't move.
- All right.

31
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,088
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

32
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,641
You were one of us,
you fucking rat!

33
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,536
Move. Move.

34
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,909
What the fuck was that?

35
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,754
Jojo,
let's get the fuck out of here.

36
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,185
Drop your weapon!

37
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,953
Freeze.

38
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,497
He's undercover!

39
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,557
Stand down!

40
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,559
Stand the fuck down!

41
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,433
Put your fucking weapon down!

42
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,519
Take that, motherfucker!

43
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,949
All units, I got two on the move.

44
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,085
Dark green muscle car heading
south-east on St. Bernard towards MLK.

45
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,062
Agent in pursuit.
I repeat, agent in pursuit.

46
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,960
What the fuck was that?

47
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,795
Fuck! There's cops all
over the fucking place.

48
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,703
Fuck! Fuck!

49
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,211
Come on, Dalton.

50
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,824
You wanna play chicken,
motherfucker? Let's do this.

51
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,900
Out of this car, Danny.

52
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,168
Out of the car!

53
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,175
You rat, motherfucker!

54
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,515
Put the gun down.

55
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,248
Drop it, Jojo.

56
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,225
Drop the gun. Drop it!

57
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,220
Ahh!

58
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,488
Drop the gun.

59
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,861
Stand down!
Stand down!

60
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,035
He's DEA! Get him away.

61
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,767
Stand down.

62
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,099
Fuck you.

63
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,531
You were one of us.

64
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,100
You murdered my son,
you motherfucker.

65
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,145
You're dead.
Your kids are fucking dead.

66
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,276
He was down. He was done.

67
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,923
He went for his gun.
That's protocol, Broker.

68
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,418
Broker. Broker!

69
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,623
Don't walk away from me.
Broker!

70
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,184
Cool hat.

71
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,994
Thanks.

72
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,802
Give it back.

73
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,070
You scared?

74
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,838
I said, give it back.

75
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,450
You want it?
Come get it.

76
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,216
What are you gonna
do about it? Cry?

77
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,280
Go on.

78
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,154
Cry.

79
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,085
I asked you twice.

80
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,321
Twice what, loser?

81
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,829
I asked twice.

82
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,436
Yeah, if you're gonna take the job,
you might as well do it right.

83
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,205
There's all kinds of
wood you can get here.

84
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:17,109
You got virgin cypress,
you got longleaf pine,

85
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,477
you got that pressure treated pine.

86
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,878
Well, that's my favorite one.

87
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,947
Now, anybody want to use the
cheapest shit they can find,

88
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,525
might as well buy
the shit from IKEA.

89
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,119
Look at this. Mites done
ate all through it.

90
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,594
Man!

91
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,957
Wonder why you got to do the
job again every two years.

92
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,195
That's some shit. Look at this.
Hello.

93
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,504
I'll be right there.

94
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,368
Something wrong?

95
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,843
Oh, something at Maddy's school.

96
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,745
You okay to finish?
Yeah, man.

97
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,677
I'm working with you,
not for you, Broker.

98
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,845
Hey, Broker, don't sweat it.
It's probably nothing.

99
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,787
Yeah, you could be right.

100
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,022
I hear you, but you
need to stay calm about this.

101
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,090
Stay calm?
I don't feel calm,

102
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,791
so why the hell should I stay calm?

103
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,460
No, 'cause it makes
no logical damn sense.

104
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,895
Now I want this thing settled,
and I mean now.

105
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,030
It's gonna be, honey.

106
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,199
But getting yourself all wound
up like this ain't helping.

107
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,867
Who's that, huh?
That's right. Just listen to Jim.

108
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,702
Who's that?
You know him? Huh?

109
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,770
I don't know.

110
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,417
Is that the father of the goddamn
little girl? Are you the father?

111
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,609
Mr. Broker?

112
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,977
What happened?

113
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,125
Maddy's fine. She's in the classroom.
Will you come with me?

114
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,987
I want to see my boy.

115
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,286
- Teddy, baby, you okay?
- Cassie!

116
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,221
Look at this. Does it hurt?
I know it does.

117
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,056
Look, there's blood all over
his goddamn new shirt, Jimmy.

118
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,124
That's why you gotta watch

119
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,225
the sneaky little bitches
on the playground.

120
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,893
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey.

121
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,662
Hey, what, huh? Hey, what?
You wanna say something?

122
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,563
Hey, hey, hey.
You wanna say something to me?

123
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,599
Why don't we just let
them leave the building?

124
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,801
Why is the sheriff here?

125
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,670
For Cassie Bodine.

126
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,572
Last time we had a scene with Cassie,
she threatened the principal.

127
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,446
Their son is a special needs case.

128
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,077
By the way, I'm Susan
Hetch, school psychologist.

129
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,245
Phil Broker.

130
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,187
Listen, you've got a great girl.

131
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,462
You all right?

132
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,969
So, what happened?

133
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,995
I warned him two times,
like I was supposed to.

134
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,265
The schoolyard monitor said
she saw Maddy hit Teddy pretty hard,

135
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,766
like she knew what she was doing.

136
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,301
He started it.
He's a bully.

137
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,602
Maddy, come on.
Hey.

138
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,204
Maybe this is my fault.

139
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,975
I taught her to defend herself.

140
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,176
Think it's good teaching
your little girl to fight?

141
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,677
No.

142
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,880
Defend herself though, yeah.

143
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,020
Hey, Maddy, do you mind waiting
in the hall, just for a minute?

144
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,698
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

145
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,127
So, Why'd you guys move up here?

146
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,830
It's a little remote
for most people.

147
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,131
She wanted a horse.

148
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,637
Maddy's mother
grew up around here, so

149
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,140
thought it'd be a good place
to start rebuilding.

150
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,947
Her file says that your
wife died fairly recently.

151
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,181
Last year?
Yeah.

152
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,091
It's been hard on her.

153
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,590
Her mom was sick for a while.

154
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,293
Anything else?

155
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,529
Why has he been picking on me?

156
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,331
Yeah, he picks on you because
he thinks you're different.

157
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,432
But I'm not different

158
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,167
Well, from him you are.

159
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,002
Nothing gets clone about it.

160
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,671
Except this guy here
gets walking along.

161
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,673
- Nothing happening there.
- Okay.

162
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,751
Oh, well, then do it. Do it!
All right.

163
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,244
Hey, Broker.
Hey, Jimmy.

164
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,879
Broker!
All right, stand by the car, baby.

165
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,781
What's wrong?
Just stand by the car, please.

166
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:16,882
Don't take any shit, Jimmy.

167
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,426
Jimmy, back in the truck, please.

168
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,855
You owe my son a goddamn apology.

169
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,258
Take it easy,
like the officer said, okay?

170
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,293
Jimmy, back in the truck, please.

171
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,629
Some sneaky little bitch
cheap shots my son.

172
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,964
Somebody owes us a goddamn apology.

173
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,099
That's goddamn right.

174
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,768
Don't call her that, please.
Don't call her that.

175
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,036
Can you get in the
truck, please, honey?

176
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,304
Don't turn your back on me.

177
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,605
Honey, baby, get in the truck.

178
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,686
- Get him, Jimmy. Get him, Jimmy.
- Hey, hey, hey!

179
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,210
- Come on, take him down, Jimmy.
- Hey.

180
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,445
Hey, hey, hey.

181
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,455
Arrest him! Keith!
Get off of him. Back off.

182
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,715
What the fuck are you doing?

183
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,651
Get this motherfucker out of here.
Sir, move away.

184
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,719
God damn it,
what are you doing?

185
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,221
Keith, what the fuck are you doing?

186
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,696
Cassie, shut up.

187
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,325
You're gonna let him
get away with that?

188
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,698
It's okay, baby.
Get in the truck.

189
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,663
It doesn't look okay.
It's okay.

190
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,565
Get in the truck.

191
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,400
- Go and do something, will you?
- Are you okay?

192
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,706
Breathe, Jimmy.
Jesus Christ!

193
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,879
Yes, mosey on over.

194
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,807
- Am I in trouble here?
- No, no.

195
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,285
I saw what happened.
He was out of line.

196
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,389
You really had to take him
down that hard though?

197
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,484
Embarrassed a man in front
of his child, Mr. Broker.

198
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,494
It goes both ways, Sheriff.

199
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,457
She all right?

200
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,757
You all right?

201
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,427
So, you moved into the old
Griffin place awhile back?

202
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,262
What you doing to
keep busy around here?

203
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,500
There a reason you're
asking these questions?

204
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,209
Well, maybe I'm
just being friendly.

205
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,603
Or maybe I'm bored,
or maybe I'm curious,

206
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,477
or whatever, it doesn't matter.

207
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,173
It's my right to ask.

208
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,581
Things got out of hand, Sheriff.
That won't happen again.

209
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,159
Dad.

210
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,188
There's a bunch of teachers
watching us right now.

211
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,117
You're a pussy.

212
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:34,030
What?
I said you are a motherfucking pussy.

213
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,030
That's what you are.

214
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,638
You let him make fools out of all
of us, in front of everybody.

215
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,828
Now the whole fucking
town is gonna know.

216
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,196
Look, I lost my...

217
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,499
You lost your what, Jimmy?
You lost your what?

218
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,167
I lost my balance.

219
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,235
You fucking lost your balance.

220
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,703
He spun you,
dropped you on your ass.

221
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,104
Mom, don't curse.

222
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,439
Dad tripped just like me.

223
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,607
What's the plan, Jimmy?

224
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,242
Right now, nothing.

225
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,010
We still got Keith on our tail.

226
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,554
Fuck Keith!

227
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,683
How did he buy that new truck?

228
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,718
That's what I want to know.
How did he buy that new truck?

229
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,421
Who?
Who?

230
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,099
Fucking who?

231
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,904
Him! The motherfucker that put you clown.
You forget him?

232
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,269
My God, he put you down so hard.

233
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,610
I gotta see my brother.

234
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,252
Let's just keep this
a family matter, Cass.

235
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,288
What do you call him?

236
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,452
Yeah, now you're acting all big.

237
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,291
Fucking idiot.

238
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,787
Come on now,
fire that fucking shit up.

239
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,796
Look at you, you dumb motherfucker!

240
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,636
Boo! Boo! Boo!
Boo! Boo! Boo!

241
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,543
Afternoon.

242
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,649
Tweaker birds,
cooking up some shit.

243
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,110
Turn that music off.

244
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,882
Turn that fucking music off!

245
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,817
Hey.

246
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,995
How old are you?

247
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,888
Seventeen.

248
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,444
All right, go on.
Get out of here.

249
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,348
Are you coming?

250
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,592
They ain't coming.
Get the fuck out of here!

251
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,167
As for you guys...

252
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,180
Fuck!

253
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,215
Oh, fuck.

254
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,014
My name is Gator Bodine.

255
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,918
Hope I didn't hurt
you too badly, sir.

256
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,320
Just wanted you to get a little
taste of what's gonna happen to you

257
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,656
if you continue cooking
this illegal substance

258
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,803
in my neck of the woods.

259
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,028
Look, man.
We didn't mean no disrespect.

260
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,497
This here is just for us, you know.

261
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,399
Oh, I don't doubt it.

262
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,807
Just fun, just kids having fun.

263
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,404
Enjoying life.

264
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,107
Celebrating.

265
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,342
Well, let me warn you,

266
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,011
I've got a five-gallon can
of gasoline out in my truck

267
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,081
that I will happily pour
down your fucking throats

268
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,492
if I ever catch you cooking and
stinking up my town again.

269
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,302
God, stop!

270
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,567
Now, listen up.

271
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,680
I don't wanna have to kill
a bunch of little kids.

272
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:17,780
You will stand up and run,
in any direction you please.

273
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,253
Just not this one.

274
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,213
That clear?
Yeah.

275
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,257
All right, now get
the fuck out of here!

276
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,789
Go!

277
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,257
Run!

278
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,688
Run!

279
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,834
Piece of shit
kindergarten operation.

280
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,468
Fucking kids suck.

281
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,781
How are the knuckles, bruiser?

282
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,175
It feels fine now, Dad.
Oh, yeah?

283
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,111
Watch out, here comes
Maddy Mad-fists. Pow!

284
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:54,723
Dad. Really?

285
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,622
Mmm-hmm. Really?

286
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,030
Come on.
All right, listen.

287
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,323
I'm proud you
stood up for yourself.

288
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,969
You set boundaries with this kid.

289
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,367
Sounds like a motorboat.
What, is he snoring?

290
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,805
Dad?

291
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,482
Yeah.

292
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,751
Were you scared today?

293
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,318
The truth.

294
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,984
There's nothing wrong
with being a little scared.

295
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,161
Then why didn't you look scared?

296
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,261
Lots of practice.

297
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,062
Night, Luther.

298
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,124
Dad?

299
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,326
Yes.

300
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,229
What do you think of Miss Hetch?

301
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,933
I'd say she's...
I'd say she's all right.

302
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,499
You know what I mean.
Yes.

303
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,179
I know exactly what you mean.

304
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,043
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

305
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,202
Shit.

306
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,765
Look, you need to cool way down.

307
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,166
I need to cool way down?

308
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,169
You think we're gonna be disrespected
by some son of a bitch?

309
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,671
Well, I hate to say it,

310
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,874
but putting your old man on the
ground ain't any big thing.

311
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,342
When he was talking to Keith,

312
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,244
I heard him say...
What, the fucking sheriff was there?

313
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,449
I heard him say he was living
at the old Griffin place.

314
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,082
Fuck.

315
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,092
Can't you go over there
and do some things?

316
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,387
Do what things?
Mess with their heads,

317
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,188
like you do everyone else.

318
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,959
Scare 'em.

319
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,231
Hey, boss.

320
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,363
We good for the night?

321
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,317
I'll talk lo you two in
a minute, all right?

322
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:54,830
All right.

323
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,743
Good seeing you again, Cassie.

324
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,440
What the hell's
wrong with those two?

325
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,909
Never mind 'em.
Fucking monkeys is what they are.

326
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,680
Hey.
Mmm?

327
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,859
You look a little jumpy.
I know.

328
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,090
I need something.

329
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,290
I need a little something

330
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,659
to stop my stomach
from knotting up.

331
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,473
You want me to beg?

332
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,343
No.

333
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,616
No.

334
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,618
If I can control it, you
can control it, right?

335
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,526
Yeah.

336
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,294
I'll handle that Broker thing.

337
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,997
Thank you.

338
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,710
Planning kids' birthday
parties, it's my specialty.

339
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,145
Be happy to take
care of it for her.

340
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,646
Thanks.

341
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,481
I'm not very good with those things.
Missed half of them.

342
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,084
Don't worry. I'm on it.
It'll be fun.

343
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,855
You know, she really
likes you, Susan.

344
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,862
It's a bit of a milestone, I'd say.

345
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,391
Do you think you can
talk to her sometime?

346
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,900
Of course.

347
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,701
Maddy used to talk
to her mom for hours.

348
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,599
I think she'd like to talk
to a woman more often.

349
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,767
I'd be happy to.

350
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:10,868
Thanks.

351
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,703
One more thing,

352
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,145
people around here can
do some foolish things.

353
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,241
Meaning?

354
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,179
It's a bit like Appalachia,
like feuds, they still exist.

355
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,450
And you're new here.

356
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,882
So I just think it
would be best for Maddy

357
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,851
if you would smooth everything over

358
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,719
while it's still
fresh in people's minds.

359
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,161
Just two kids working things out.

360
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,857
You can go from two
kids and a fistfight

361
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,358
to the emergency room real fast.

362
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,402
I didn't know this town
had an emergency room.

363
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,430
Now you're catching on.

364
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,398
Look, people talk.

365
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,603
They decided you're
a question mark, so.

366
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,843
Keep it smooth. Check.

367
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,470
You want something around here?
I don't think so.

368
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,401
Look, what happened, happened.

369
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,172
We don't want any more trouble.

370
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,740
See, your kid made the trouble.
Not ours, yours.

371
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,943
What do we need to do to
make this go away, Jimmy?

372
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,283
From you?

373
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,988
I want an apology.

374
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,793
Full apology.

375
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,123
I want you to apologize to my wife,

376
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,192
'cause it's what's right,
and my kid, too.

377
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,339
He saw the whole damn thing.

378
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,264
I apologize for what happened.

379
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,536
To them, too.

380
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,507
We good now, Jimmy?

381
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,644
Yeah, all right.

382
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,417
Go on.
You've said enough.

383
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,307
Go ahead and pump it your own self.

384
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,249
I'll be with you in a minute.

385
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,860
God damn, Mama's freezer.

386
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,599
There he is.

387
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,211
Fuck!

388
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:59,409
Still ain't got this
piece of shit fixed.

389
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,879
Hey, neighbor, how you doing?

390
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,282
Can I get that pump?

391
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,588
I'm almost done.

392
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,990
See, I need the goddamn pump right now.
Did you hear me?

393
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,465
- Can I help y'all out here?
- No.

394
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,794
We don't need your help.

395
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,440
He's done.

396
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,234
Fill up the truck, Clay.

397
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,941
That's $12.84, sir.

398
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,346
I wasn't done yet.

399
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,014
I think you are.

400
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,196
Whatever you're thinking,
rethink it.

401
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,096
"Rethink it."
He wants me to rethink it.

402
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,895
You ain't turning that back on.

403
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,541
Oh, shit.

404
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,342
You fucked up.

405
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,290
Why don't we step around
the side of the building

406
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,959
so I can kick your fucking
ass up over your shoulders?

407
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,417
They from around here?

408
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,384
I ain't never seen them.

409
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,896
Who put you up to this?

410
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,229
Nobody.

411
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,526
Bring that over.

412
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,928
Down the hatch.

413
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,575
Yeah?

414
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,372
Fuck.

415
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,546
How the fuck did that happen?

416
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,153
His fucking kid goes to my
nephew's school! I don't fucking know!

417
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,056
Yeah, I'll deal with it.
God damn it!

418
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,965
Dad?
Mmm-hmm?

419
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,303
What happened to your hands?

420
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,097
Right there?

421
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,902
Oh, yeah.

422
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,536
Me and Teedo were trying to pull that
rusty, old fence out of the ground,

423
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,274
you know, the one
behind the stable.

424
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,418
Yeah.

425
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,085
We won, though.

426
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,375
Afternoon.

427
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,004
Mind stepping out for a minute?

428
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:55,110
You can stay in there, little
girl, this won't take too long.

429
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,678
Is there a problem, Sheriff?

430
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,349
Well, I got a report of an
altercation at the filling station.

431
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,918
You know anything about that?

432
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,792
Anybody pressing charges?

433
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,123
No, nobody is pressing any charges.

434
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,133
Then there's nothing
worth talking about.

435
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,195
What are you' son?

436
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,570
You WITSEC, huh?

437
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,703
You ex-military,
ex-law enforcement?

438
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,304
Ex-what?

439
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,349
Well, if I were
ex-military, Sheriff,

440
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:35,051
I'd probably refer to the answer
as "need to know information."

441
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:39,154
Maybe some people
don't need to know.

442
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:44,065
Here's what you
need to know, Broker.

443
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,166
You have got my attention, son.

444
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,172
Get that hand looked at.

445
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,381
You're gonna leave me
behind today, as usual?

446
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,982
I think so.

447
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,424
Making new friends at school?

448
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,087
Yeah, I made a lot of friends.

449
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,723
I've learned some cool
stuff in science class.

450
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,258
I don't believe that

451
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:25,095
Did you know that the trees
along the river, bald cypress,

452
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,531
they can grow, like, 100 feet.

453
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,766
That is cool.

454
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,035
But not as cool as snakes.

455
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,369
Snakes?
Yeah.

456
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,174
We've got moccasins'
copperheads, diamondbacks.

457
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,176
No king cobras, right?

458
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,046
Dad' no, king cobras are like,
from the far east somewhere.

459
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,056
That's a relief.

460
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,457
Dad?
Yeah?

461
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,798
Why did we move out here?

462
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,861
Why?
Because there's no king cobras.

463
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,530
Come on, look around.

464
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:02,439
A beautiful house, horse
trails, river in our backyard.

465
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,341
Seriously, what else
could we ask for?

466
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,081
Wi-Fi.

467
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,740
Wi-Fi?

468
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,648
Yeah, Wi-Fi.

469
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,523
Anyone home?

470
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,827
Your door is open.

471
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,796
Neighbor calling.

472
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,628
That was a tie.

473
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,137
OK.

474
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,675
Maybe.
I think you got it.

475
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,005
Do you know "grace"?

476
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,107
She a new friend at school?

477
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,948
The new vocab word from class.

478
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,984
"Grace."
Yeah, that's a good one.

479
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,962
I think Mom had that

480
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,994
Yeah, you got a good memory, Maddy.

481
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,634
She did.

482
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,300
The way she dressed, smiled.

483
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,145
Everything about her.

484
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,248
I miss Mom.

485
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,159
Me, too.

486
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:36,866
I just... I miss her so
much that my stomach hurts.

487
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:45,010
And I get this feeling that
she worries about you.

488
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,752
And that she wants you to be happy.

489
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,120
Come here.

490
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,194
Hey.

491
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,357
If you're here, I'm happy.

492
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,966
Come on, what else could I be?

493
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,252
Come on, catch up.

494
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:10,865
I find myself always
trying to do that.

495
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,644
Luther!

496
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,349
Luther!

497
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,999
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

498
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,535
Easy, boy, easy. Easy.

499
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,392
Dad?

500
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,329
Dad!

501
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,692
Have you seen Luther?

502
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,961
Luther? No, sweetie.

503
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,296
I don't hear his bell.
I'll go look.

504
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,398
Hey. Get back inside.

505
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,000
You should be
getting ready for bed.

506
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,236
Don't worry, I'll find him.
Off you go.

507
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,438
Okay.

508
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,810
Dad, you know I can't
sleep without Luther.

509
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,719
I know, but I need
you to try, okay?

510
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,682
I'll find him.

511
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,718
And you'll find Bunny, too?
Yes.

512
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,421
I'll find them both.

513
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,191
Hey.

514
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,536
It'll be okay.
Okay.

515
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,872
Luther.
Come here, kitty. Luther.

516
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,581
"Phil Broker."

517
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,393
Motherfucker!

518
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,825
Nice hair.

519
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,094
"For a few years now,
biker gang known as

520
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,264
<i>"the Outcast motorcycle gang
led by Danny Turrie."</i>

521
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,601
No! You're done! You're dead!

522
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,804
Holy shit!

523
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,244
Broker, Broker, Broker.

524
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,982
Very nice to meet you,
Agent Broker.

525
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,596
Luther?

526
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,424
Luther?

527
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,096
Come on.

528
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,065
Coming through!

529
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,759
Yeah?

530
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,095
Hey, I think I got
something big for us.

531
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,796
Big? Like what?

532
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,299
Just get over here
as soon as possible.

533
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,267
My shift doesn't end
for another three hours.

534
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,604
Then I've got to drive from Shreveport?
Gator, shit.

535
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:51,875
All right, all right. Just make it
first thing in the morning, okay?

536
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,384
Everything is changing.

537
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,903
Yeah!

538
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:50,704
Remember Jojo?

539
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,669
Jojo Turrie?

540
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,505
Danny T's boy?
Of course, I do.

541
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,773
The kid was bat shit.

542
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,146
He was.

543
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,121
Until he got shot by
the police 47 times.

544
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,049
Losing your only kid like that.

545
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,628
I hear Danny T is still
pretty fucked up about it.

546
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,188
Well, yeah.

547
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:15,303
Well, they never did catch whoever
snitched on Jojo and Danny T.

548
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:17,527
And?

549
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,002
'Cause it wasn't just a snitch.

550
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,532
It was a goddamn undercover cop.

551
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,235
Just read.

552
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,709
<i>That guy Broker,</i>

553
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,978
<i>he's the snitch they didn't want
showing up in the courtroom.</i>

554
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,313
What?

555
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,715
M.C. Dalton,
that's his snitch name.

556
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,218
<i>A state narc is
living in Rayville. Shit!</i>

557
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,552
Relax, relax.
Do you have...

558
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:45,324
I think he's just living low
here with his daughter.

559
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,998
Trust me, this is our shot.

560
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,896
What the hell are
you doing here, Broker?

561
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,303
Turn that off.

562
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,812
Hey!

563
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,838
Let's skip the bullshit.
Get right to it.

564
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,841
Some small-time amateur crap,
going back and forth.

565
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,243
Know anything about it?

566
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:07,844
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

567
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,246
Is this fucking
amusing to you, Klum?

568
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,324
You think it's fucking funny?

569
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,251
You got your apology.

570
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,786
Me and my little girl
are gonna be left in peace.

571
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,728
Don't escalate this any more.

572
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:20,959
And Klum,

573
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,361
I want my kid's cat back.

574
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,870
Cat?

575
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,264
I don't know nothing about no cat.

576
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:28,532
Today.

577
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:32,476
No hair out of place,
you understand me?

578
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:36,713
Good.

579
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:42,179
A lot of things have changed
since you were last here.

580
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,618
Check it out, I got glassware,
mantles, generator, exhaust system.

581
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,188
Got it all going on.

582
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,822
Why the fuck do we need Danny T?

583
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,503
We're gonna give him
that rat fuck narc

584
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:59,097
in exchange for
state-wide distribution.

585
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,799
Yeah, but, Gator,
these guys are fucking bikers.

586
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,201
You can't trust them.

587
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,335
You're gonna give them this guy,

588
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,903
they're gonna turn around
and they're gonna kill him.

589
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,638
And then you got nothing.

590
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,342
Look, this means no more small time
jobs, no more sweating middlemen.

591
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,682
All we do is cook and get paid.

592
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:16,980
It's never that easy.

593
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:21,318
All you have to do
is learn a few lines,

594
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,260
go and talk to Danny T's lawyer.

595
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,822
Like hell I am.

596
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:29,192
You use them.
Coming back all humble.

597
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,494
You're not asking for money.

598
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:35,198
You're giving Danny this
guy as a gift, as a favor.

599
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,068
Gator, that guy is a fucking pig.

600
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,545
Shh! Just trust me.

601
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:47,146
You're gonna get the
negotiation of your life.

602
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,221
Ready for the big day tomorrow?

603
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,889
It's just a birthday.

604
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,693
Hey, come on, it's the 10th birthday.
It's a special one.

605
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,339
I guess.

606
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,735
Hey, look what I
found jumping around.

607
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,943
Jumping around?
Yeah, jumping around.

608
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,414
Thanks.

609
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,785
It's nice.

610
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,878
I know it's not as
good as the original,

611
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:25,315
but I thought she might fill
in until we find Bunny.

612
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,086
Yep.

613
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,589
You know, I was thinking,

614
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,861
you should have a birthday
party with your class.

615
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,138
Can Miss Hetch come?

616
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,329
She's the one who planned it.

617
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,168
My idea, of course.

618
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,266
Thanks, Dad.

619
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,502
Yep.

620
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,323
Sheryl.
Sheryl Mott.

621
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,825
Surprise, surprise,
surprise.

622
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,530
You're not a hard man to find,
Werksey, old habits and all.

623
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,970
How are you doing, Sheryl?

624
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,970
What's up, kid?

625
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:21,173
I want you to look at something.

626
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,712
Like what?

627
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,311
You got a new gang tattoo
that you want to show me?

628
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,114
It's a little bit
more important than that.

629
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:34,023
It's a gift for Danny T.

630
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,401
You got 10 minutes.

631
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,042
"A gift," she says.

632
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,856
This guy killed my fucking kid.

633
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,855
Please tell me you know
where this motherfucker is.

634
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,923
Guess what? Time to go.

635
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,658
She does.

636
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,826
Hey, you can finish it tonight.

637
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,131
Okay.

638
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,040
Take care of this for me.

639
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,091
Miss Klum?

640
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,024
What are you going to do now, Broker?
What do you want to say?

641
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,932
Wanna come to my
party this weekend?

642
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,610
What, Teddy? She's talking to
you, hon, not me. Come on.

643
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,081
I guess. Yeah.

644
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,748
Cool. Come on, let's go.

645
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,016
All right. Go on.

646
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,658
Teddy got some blood on his shirt.
Are you replacing it?

647
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,821
Yeah, I'm replacing it.

648
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,592
All right.
I guess that does it.

649
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,673
See you around, Miss Klum.

650
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,141
So, I heard something interesting.

651
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,610
Yeah? Something tells me you're
gonna tell me what that is.

652
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:44,347
Just that Jimmy Klum got his ass whopped.
So did his kid.

653
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,082
Fascinating.

654
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,584
Where did you hear that?

655
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:50,920
Well, you shoot enough pool,
drink enough beer in town,

656
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,641
you hear a little bit
of everything, Broker.

657
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:56,593
By the way, that's old news.
We shook and made up.

658
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:57,760
Is that what you think?

659
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:58,862
Yeah.

660
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,163
I got some new news for you.

661
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,139
People around here
don't shake and make up.

662
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,368
It never goes away that easy.

663
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,674
It's old-school in the
feuding sense around here.

664
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,341
Hey, someone broke into our house.
Is that old-school?

665
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,443
There it is, that's
called country payback.

666
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,311
Somebody's just trying to scare
your ass out of here, is all.

667
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,446
You'll be all right.

668
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,514
Jimmy Klum, you mean?

669
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,682
Fuck, no.
Jimmy Klum is a bitch.

670
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,784
Listen, I know
everybody around here,

671
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,693
and Jimmy Klum's bitch ass
ain't breaking into shit.

672
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,891
Now, his wife's brother
is a whole different story.

673
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:29,459
Who's his wife's brother?

674
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,961
They call him Gator
for some dumb-ass reason.

675
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,631
Lives down by
the Rayville watershed.

676
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,534
Fronts as a boat mechanic,
can't fix shit.

677
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,408
But the word is he's
cooking up that meth.

678
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,542
Hey, if I was you, I'd be real
careful around him, Broker.

679
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,780
He ain't true, you hear me?

680
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,217
The sheriff know about him?

681
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,985
Know about him?

682
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,987
Man, him and Sheriff Keith
got it all figured out.

683
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,557
You see, Gator snitches for Keith,

684
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,026
throws him all the small
fish, makes his job easy.

685
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:06,140
In turn, Sheriff looks the other
direction whenever Gator wants to cook.

686
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,366
Some bullshit.

687
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,668
Yeah, thanks for
the history lesson.

688
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,202
Listen, I grew up
around these rednecks,

689
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:16,384
and I think you ought to know
who you're fucking with.

690
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,043
And in case you got any interest,

691
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:23,987
Gator eats breakfast nearly every
day at Lions café, just like me.

692
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:26,015
Now, he don't look
like much or nothing,

693
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,752
but you remember what I told you,

694
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,762
he ain't true.

695
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,223
Crazy, waiting to happen.

696
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,430
Hey, where are you?

697
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:44,033
They set the meet at this fucking
crayfish shack off Creek Road.

698
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,935
You know I'm allergic
to this shit, right?

699
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,304
Just get it done,
all right, Sheryl?

700
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,040
The guy they're sending,
Cyrus Hanks.

701
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:55,144
<i>Are you fucking kidding me? I know him.
He's a fucking animal, Gator.</i>

702
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,380
He's a fucking stone-cold killer.

703
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,585
Look, don't worry about any of that.
Just make it happen.

704
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,557
Look at you.

705
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,220
Nice place, Cyrus.

706
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,856
Yeah, well, let's just say I'm
comfortable around fat people.

707
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,958
They eat the way
gamblers play the slots,

708
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,061
they're fucking oblivious
to everything around them.

709
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:19,570
Plus, I love these fucking things.

710
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,364
Are you hungry?

711
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,799
No, I'm fine.

712
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,503
Sweetheart, black coffee
with a little honey.

713
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,673
So, what's it going to take

714
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,842
to find this rat fuck?
You know where he is, yeah?

715
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,711
Him and his kid.

716
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:39,224
And to get him,
you want what, exactly?

717
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,320
I don't want anything for the narc.

718
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:47,525
He's a gift.
Oh, he's a gift? He's a gift.

719
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,038
Since when does a meth
whore give away gifts?

720
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,498
I've spent the last couple of years

721
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:57,033
putting together
the right equipment,

722
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:59,769
perfect partner, perfect location.

723
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,438
All we need is distribution, that's
the main thing we're after...

724
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:06,542
You got me fucking fooled, Sheryl.

725
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:09,545
'Cause underneath this
beautiful tweaker body,

726
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,884
you're a fucking genius.

727
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,559
Where's the narc?

728
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,763
Do we have a deal?

729
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,356
Where is the narc?

730
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,798
Do we have a deal, Cyrus?

731
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:30,600
Come over here.

732
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,236
You got five seconds before I drill
your fucking skull into this table

733
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:34,937
and then into the floor,
you understand me?

734
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,372
Don't you fuck with me, Sheryl.

735
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:37,813
All right.

736
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:41,620
Where is the fucking narc?

737
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,025
Bye!

738
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,283
Bye.

739
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,066
Hi.

740
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,141
What are you doing?

741
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:39,101
Cleaning.

742
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,838
Cleaning?
Yeah.

743
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,811
It's filthy in there.

744
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,775
Well, I'm glad you noticed.

745
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,080
What are you doing here?

746
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,652
I came to tell you that I dealt
with Broker, the girl's father.

747
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,450
I want you to stay away from him.

748
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,062
Hey, you got something for me?

749
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,621
Cassie, I'm trying
to tell you something.

750
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,393
Do not go near Broker anymore.

751
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,460
Got it.

752
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,833
Okay.

753
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,799
Well, I'm not holding, so I'm
sorry, I can't help you.

754
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,467
You're not holding?

755
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,669
Uh-huh.

756
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,071
Well, I think
that's fucking bullshit.

757
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,639
Cassie, why don't you
just clean yourself up?

758
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,673
That's fucking bullshit!

759
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,976
Take a fucking shower.
Then what the fuck are you doing here?

760
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,143
Eat a sandwich or something.

761
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,379
You take a fucking shower,
Gator, look at you!

762
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,181
Cassie, just pull
yourself together.

763
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:26,816
I'm sick of this shit.
Hey, hey, hey.

764
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,151
Shh! Teddy is sleeping.

765
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,887
You wake him up, it's gonna be...

766
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,588
Don't worry.

767
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,700
I'm not gonna make
any noise, I'm leaving.

768
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,396
No more. I'm done.

769
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,267
No more, Cassie.

770
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,046
Yo, Gator.

771
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,982
How is it hanging, man?

772
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,284
Why?

773
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,457
Listen, man, I need a favor.

774
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,795
A favor?

775
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:07,223
Look, Jimmy, you know that I already
keep your garbage business going.

776
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:10,462
Man, I need you to stop
giving that shit to my wife.

777
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:14,468
All right? Look at her, man.
She's falling to pieces.

778
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,737
Maybe you should do a
better job taking care of her.

779
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:31,147
Yeah.
You sleeping?

780
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:32,648
Like a baby.

781
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:33,783
What have you got?

782
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:37,420
<i>Gator Bodine. I sniffed around
like you asked. A couple of arrests.</i>

783
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,259
No convictions.
You want details?

784
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,058
No, don't bother.

785
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,659
<i>But there is something,
Broker.</i>

786
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,129
Sheryl Marie Mott, ex-biker
groupie from Shreveport.

787
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,566
<i>Busted twice for smuggling
dope into Angola.</i>

788
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,003
One of those times was to
your old pal, Danny T.

789
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:58,448
<i>All of a sudden, Danny T's skank
is hanging out in Rayville.</i>

790
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,621
Really?

791
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,346
Send me a picture, would you?

792
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:06,515
Yeah, first thing at my desk,
I'll email you Mott's file.

793
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,627
Thanks, man.

794
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,999
<i>So, this guy Cyrus,</i>

795
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,792
you know him?

796
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:51,193
Yeah, I know him.

797
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,195
Mmm-hmm.
Did you fuck him?

798
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,068
Ugh.

799
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,049
Oh, shit.

800
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:08,917
Fuck!

801
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,521
This should be interesting.

802
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,931
We've never been properly
introduced, you and me.

803
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,089
Is that what this is,
an introduction?

804
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,490
Yeah, that's right.

805
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,159
Well, I won't ask your name.

806
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,432
I personally believe your reputation
is the most important thing.

807
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:29,198
To some people.
Yeah.

808
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,933
Maybe it should be for you, too.

809
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,735
You've worked up a pretty
bad rep around here,

810
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,438
beating up that poor kids
father in front of him.

811
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,440
It pissed off some of the locals.

812
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:41,410
And his daughter beat up Jimmy's kid.
Can you believe that?

813
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,681
Now, what kind of parent would teach
a kid to do something like that?

814
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,385
Look, I don't want
any more problems.

815
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,295
Okay.

816
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,256
Anything else you're
thinking hard about?

817
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,232
'Cause I can smell
the wood burning.

818
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,300
If someone has an issue
with me, keep it there.

819
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,397
I don't want my kid involved.

820
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:03,009
Involved?

821
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,938
I'm a little lost.

822
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,646
Well, let's get you found.

823
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,851
See the house,

824
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:17,046
the house where we're living,

825
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:21,457
the house that was broken
into by some pathetic coward

826
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:27,090
who stole a little girl's toys,
the cat, slashed a tire.

827
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:30,260
See, that's my fucking house.

828
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:36,138
Anyone who comes around again
will find me standing in it.

829
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:38,937
Okay.

830
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:48,615
Well, I think you're reaching.

831
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:52,123
Just connecting dots
that are not there.

832
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,797
You're on notice, Bodine.

833
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,590
Hey, you should tell
your little girl to be brave.

834
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,670
She's got nothing to worry about
with such a tough daddy around.

835
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,139
Nice meeting you.

836
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:20,682
Finish your breakfast.

837
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,358
What the fuck
were you doin', Gator?

838
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,163
Fucker is making it personal.

839
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:39,833
Yeah, well, we're on.

840
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:43,174
It's happening tonight.

841
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:20,552
Luther?

842
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,058
Hello, there.

843
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,724
Hey, boy.

844
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,400
Put the kitty down.

845
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:32,895
Get up really slow.

846
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:47,913
Luther?

847
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:51,585
Luther?

848
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:56,495
Got you.
Hey, Broker.

849
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,209
My old fucking Broker.

850
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,782
How you doing, man?

851
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,041
Can you hear me?

852
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:19,608
Huh?

853
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,015
You in there?

854
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,025
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me now?

855
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:32,864
Bet you do.

856
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,396
That's the tricky thing with this
rebar, especially the nine gauge.

857
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,596
You swing it too hard, too fast,

858
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:43,243
just takes your whole
fucking head off, man.

859
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:46,301
It's a very delicate operation.

860
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,311
Hey, you did all right,
though, Lew.

861
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,315
Gator'd be pissed if we did
something really fucking stupid.

862
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:56,984
He must be pissed at
you two quite a lot.

863
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,359
That's funny.
You're a funny guy, Broker.

864
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:04,321
You're a really funny fucking guy.

865
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,222
You smart-ass motherfucker.

866
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:08,663
Fucking wise-ass.

867
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,565
How do you like that, huh?

868
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,999
Everybody had you
figured for a cop, Broker.

869
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,568
You walk like a cop,
you fight like a cop,

870
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:22,181
you even smell like a fucking cop.

871
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:28,078
Come on.

872
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,981
Hey, man, Gator'll be
here soon. That's it...

873
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,561
I don't give a shit! I'm calling
the shots! You hear me?

874
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:38,288
Hey! Can you hear me?

875
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:40,361
Who's watching
your fucking kid, huh?

876
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:42,468
Who's watching your kid?

877
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,531
Your girlfriend?

878
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,299
She got a babysitter?

879
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,066
Or is she at home all by herself,

880
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:55,875
just waiting on you to
come tuck her sorry-ass in

881
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,642
and read her a bedtime story?

882
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:03,984
What the fuck!

883
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:06,952
You're dead!

884
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,727
Motherfucker!

885
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:50,930
When I get home, I am gonna
tell my girl a bedtime story.

886
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,273
This is how it ends.

887
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,857
Just tell me,
why are we going? Why?

888
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:24,793
I owe you an apology, I know, but we
don't have time to get into that.

889
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,161
What about school?

890
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,929
We'll send for your records
in the morning. It's fine.

891
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:31,033
Send for them?
No, why are we going?

892
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:32,634
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.

893
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,603
They need me back in the city.
It's new business.

894
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,204
I need to review a case.
No!

895
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,681
You said Mom
wanted us to live here.

896
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,543
That's what you said, Dad. Remember?
Yeah, I did. I did.

897
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:43,985
Things changed, darling.
Things changed.

898
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:46,319
I'm sorry, Maddy.

899
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:48,818
I'm sorry.

900
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:51,360
You're a liar.

901
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:07,069
Gator.

902
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,408
You must be Cyrus.

903
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,639
Sheryl's told me a lot about you.

904
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,012
Has she?

905
01:10:12,175 --> 01:10:13,752
That is sweet.

906
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:17,179
Where is the fuck-up?

907
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:21,316
He's about three
miles south of Route 12.

908
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,019
Rubber plantation.

909
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,321
I can draw you a map, trail,
even the inside of the house.

910
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:29,366
No, I don't need a fucking map.
We ain't driving, Gator.

911
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:32,362
Hey, check this one out.

912
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,700
What the fuck is this?

913
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,500
This many people here,
this a fucking party?

914
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:41,545
I don't fucking know. Motherfucker
just showed up with all of them.

915
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,272
<i>You ready to show
us the way, Gator?</i>

916
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,508
No, I'm not going.

917
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:15,036
Come again?

918
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,905
Look, the first person they're
gonna be looking for is me,

919
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:18,440
so I'm not gonna be
anywhere near the site.

920
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,745
I'm gonna be in a public place.

921
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:24,925
Guess you don't get to see me
shoot the rat tuck in the mouth.

922
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,616
Guess not.

923
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:28,586
What about the kid?

924
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:33,089
It's one-stop shopping,
right, Gator?

925
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:35,924
That's right.

926
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:37,433
No loose ends.

927
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,897
She's coming with me.

928
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,131
No, that's not the deal.

929
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,972
No, she's gonna show us the way.
I'll bring her back.

930
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,006
Be back.

931
01:11:58,014 --> 01:12:00,081
Listen, I can only
hold them about a week.

932
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,989
Thanks, Teedo, you're a big help.

933
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,790
Is there anything
you need to tell me?

934
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:08,160
Yeah, there is, but not now.
I got a lot of heat.

935
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,029
All right, then,
let me go load up these nags.

936
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,291
Howdy, Sheriff.
Hey, Gator.

937
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,193
How you doing?
All right.

938
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,361
Keeping busy, I hope.

939
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,495
Yeah.

940
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:48,766
That's good.

941
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,671
Just made a big sale,
so I thought we'd celebrate.

942
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,847
Congratulations.

943
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:56,574
Thank you.

944
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,518
<i>Well, I got a date
with a pool table.</i>

945
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,179
So I'll be seeing you.

946
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,518
All right.

947
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:06,982
Thanks for the whiskey.

948
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:08,250
Of course.

949
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:09,584
You keep out of trouble, now.

950
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:10,957
Yes, sir.

951
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:45,253
Twenty minutes.

952
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,690
Don't even think about not
being here, you understand me?

953
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,928
Yeah.
Go call your boyfriend.

954
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:52,797
Hey!

955
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:27,056
Motherfucker!
Come on, you fuck!

956
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,872
Where the fuck is he?

957
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:15,871
Fuck.

958
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:33,825
Maddy!

959
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,261
Go, go, go.

960
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:37,559
Maddy!

961
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:41,239
Dad, what was that?
Shh!

962
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:43,364
Dad, what was that?

963
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:44,635
Go.

964
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,247
I need you to stay
down here, okay, Maddy?

965
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:55,919
Dial 911.

966
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:58,313
Tell them who you are,
where you are.

967
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:01,449
Tell them there's a man with a gun
trying to get into the house, okay?

968
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,856
Go.

969
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:43,125
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

970
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:02,678
Go.

971
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,837
Hey!

972
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:53,796
No!

973
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,444
She's getting away!

974
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:03,542
Maddy!

975
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:19,354
Hey.

976
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:21,398
Gator, man, shit's
gone wrong out here.

977
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,591
What do you mean
"shit's gone wrong"?

978
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,227
There's too many gunshots
all over the fucking place.

979
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:29,307
Whoa, whoa, Sheryl, just slow down.
Tell me what's happening.

980
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:31,699
Fuck this noise, man.
I'm out.

981
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,801
Just stay there and
tell me what's happening!

982
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,651
Ahh!

983
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,861
Maddy, run! Run!

984
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:33,868
Help! Help! Help!

985
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:36,331
Help!

986
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,266
Help, please! Help me, please!
Hey, you okay?

987
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:39,537
Please help!

988
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:45,373
There's a man, and he's
hurting my dad back at our...

989
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:46,874
Okay, okay, listen to me.

990
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:50,211
Listen. These guys, they don't
give a shit about you, all right?

991
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:52,483
They're gonna kill you.
Do you understand?

992
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:02,123
You got to come with me, okay?

993
01:21:02,124 --> 01:21:04,167
You have to come with me!
Come on.

994
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,572
Fucking pussy!

995
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:16,073
Not okay! Dad!
No! Listen!

996
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,364
Fuck!

997
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:44,636
Let me go!

998
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:46,401
Let go of me!

999
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,668
Maddy!

1000
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:48,836
No, let me go! Dad!

1001
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:51,608
Maddy! Maddy!

1002
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:53,946
Come on.

1003
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,215
Shit.

1004
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:58,883
Maddy!

1005
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:05,722
Help, please! Dad!

1006
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:09,326
Dad, help!

1007
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:18,239
Broker?

1008
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:19,400
What the hell's going on?

1009
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:20,602
They hit the house.

1010
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,103
They took my girl.

1011
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,638
By boat. Headed south
towards Blue Cove.

1012
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:24,806
What do you mean "hit the house"?

1013
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:26,918
An ambush.
Five, six men. All armed.

1014
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,409
Tried to kill us.

1015
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,050
She's on the river?
You know who took her?

1016
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:39,124
Broker? Broker!

1017
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:41,964
Need a medic!

1018
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,728
Dispatch, I got a...

1019
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,465
You'll be okay, Teedo.

1020
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,400
Fucking rednecks.

1021
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:55,236
Sheriff, get on the radio. It's
Broker's daughter on dispatch.

1022
01:22:55,237 --> 01:22:57,004
Broker, your daughter's
on the radio.

1023
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,809
Get compression on this wound.

1024
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,641
<i>Maddy, go ahead.</i>

1025
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,009
Maddy, tell me you're okay.

1026
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:06,080
Dad? Dad, Dad, please get me
out of here, Daddy. Please?

1027
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,082
Don't worry, baby.
Trust me. I'm coming.

1028
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,984
First, you need to
tell me who took you.

1029
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,187
I don't know. Just some
lady with black hair.

1030
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:15,664
Okay, baby.
Here's what we're gonna do.

1031
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,758
When they take you out,
you need to hide the phone.

1032
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:18,279
<i>Okay.</i>

1033
01:23:18,305 --> 01:23:20,361
Look for something.
A landmark, anything.

1034
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,163
Okay. Okay.

1035
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:23,931
<i>Dad... Dad...</i>

1036
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,736
Maddy.

1037
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,471
Maddy?

1038
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:29,308
Fuck!

1039
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:33,508
Dispatch, listen here, I need you
to check back every 30 seconds.

1040
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,476
No need to, Sheriff.
Track my cell.

1041
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,345
<i>Get a state chopper.
You'll get there faster.</i>

1042
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,480
<i>Got a better idea,
track his cell.</i>

1043
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:41,048
<i>Let's get the troopers
in on this.</i>

1044
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,851
<i>I need a bear in the air, and every
road within 10 miles shut down.</i>

1045
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,219
Go for 25, work your way in.

1046
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,455
<i>25-mile radius.
Work our way in.</i>

1047
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:49,123
Tell them they're
looking for a 20-foot

1048
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:50,691
Boston Whaler, solo female driver,

1049
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,859
and a center console.

1050
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,295
20-foot Boston Whaler, solo
female driver, center console.

1051
01:23:54,296 --> 01:23:57,465
Now, these men that attacked
your house, where are they now?

1052
01:23:57,466 --> 01:23:59,873
They're right there.
How do you know?

1053
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,078
Trust me. I know.

1054
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:07,919
Sheryl, answer your fucking phone!

1055
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:12,624
Just meet me at the fucking shop!
What the fuck's going on?

1056
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,088
Give me the phone.

1057
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,464
Quiet down, now.

1058
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,096
<i>Daddy?</i>
Maddy.

1059
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:32,567
Daddy, we're stopping. I'm really scared.
Please hurry.

1060
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:35,146
<i>I see two big fans.</i>

1061
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,812
And we've stopped in a barn.

1062
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:45,617
Broker!

1063
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:48,154
Broker, you need to tell us, now.

1064
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,094
Okay.

1065
01:24:59,061 --> 01:25:02,597
Come on. It's okay. It's okay.
Just give me your hand.

1066
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,864
Go away!

1067
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,237
Fuck!

1068
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,234
God!

1069
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:08,914
Fuck!

1070
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,040
Pick up, baby.

1071
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:15,585
Come on. Come on, Maddy.

1072
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:27,529
Sheryl, I've been calling you.
What the fuck?

1073
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,625
What the fuck happened?

1074
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,293
Everything fucking happened.

1075
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,961
What the fuck does that mean?

1076
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,563
Where's Cyrus?
Where's everyone?

1077
01:25:35,564 --> 01:25:37,539
I don't fucking know.

1078
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:39,133
You left them there?

1079
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,506
I got the kid.

1080
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,339
What?
I have the kid.

1081
01:25:43,005 --> 01:25:44,650
The kid is here.

1082
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:48,553
You brought her here?

1083
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,956
You brought the kid here?

1084
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:59,655
Are you retarded, Sheryl?

1085
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:00,956
Don't!

1086
01:26:01,423 --> 01:26:03,090
Don't, Gator!

1087
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:04,861
Don't what, bitch?

1088
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:06,565
What the fuck, Gator?

1089
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:08,129
It's over.
Come on, this is over.

1090
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:09,497
You brought
the fucking kid here.

1091
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:10,798
You fucked this up!

1092
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,033
This is not
what you do, man!

1093
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:13,768
You fucking brought a witness here?

1094
01:26:13,769 --> 01:26:15,436
You do not kill a kid, Gator.

1095
01:26:15,437 --> 01:26:18,039
The only fucking chance
we had, you fucked up!

1096
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,007
You brought fucking
Cyrus into this!

1097
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,609
Why did you bring the kid here?

1098
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:23,544
Why the fuck did you bring her here?
Gator. Gator.

1099
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,446
Get your fucking hands off me!

1100
01:26:25,447 --> 01:26:28,093
You brought a fucking
witness here, huh?

1101
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,621
All right. Damn it.

1102
01:26:33,622 --> 01:26:36,325
Just shut the fuck
up and keep her quiet.

1103
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:38,227
Can you do that?

1104
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:43,998
What y'all doing here?

1105
01:26:43,999 --> 01:26:45,332
Did you hear about the shooting?

1106
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:46,773
No, what shooting?

1107
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:48,340
Up at the old Griffin place?

1108
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,806
No, I didn't hear about it. No.
You didn't hear about it?

1109
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,308
Word is people are dead
and a child's missing.

1110
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:55,643
No shit.

1111
01:26:55,644 --> 01:26:58,017
Well, no shooting going on here.

1112
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:02,086
So maybe y'all better go home.
Hey, Jimmy, you gonna take her home?

1113
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,085
Come on. Come on.

1114
01:27:04,086 --> 01:27:05,853
Tell me you didn't have
anything to do with it.

1115
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:07,688
I didn't have
anything to do with it.

1116
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:10,224
Now, maybe you're a little high right now.
You're not thinking straight.

1117
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,892
But it's time to go home, okay?

1118
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,766
Jimmy!
Cassie, come on, let's go.

1119
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,873
We live here, too.
You know what I mean?

1120
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:18,833
Shit, I got to get you out of here.

1121
01:27:18,834 --> 01:27:20,000
Let go of me.

1122
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,602
No, I'm not gonna let go...
Let go of me!

1123
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,170
I'm trying
to help you. Stop it.

1124
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:24,672
But I can't.
My daddy...

1125
01:27:24,673 --> 01:27:26,774
We don't have a choice.
We don't have a choice.

1126
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:28,509
- Please, he's in trouble!
- No, no, no!

1127
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,178
Let me go!
Let go of me!

1128
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:32,680
Cass, it ain't
none of our business.

1129
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:34,081
No, let me go find my dad!

1130
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,386
Let go of me!

1131
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:38,455
What the hell's going on here?

1132
01:27:43,225 --> 01:27:44,759
You don't wanna get
into this, Cassie.

1133
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,961
Uh-uh.

1134
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:26,901
Cassie.

1135
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:28,636
All right, Gator. Be cool, man. All right?
You're crazy.

1136
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:29,837
Do you know that?
You're crazy.

1137
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:30,971
No, she's staying here!

1138
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,506
She's not!

1139
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,008
Cassie, you fucking started this!

1140
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:35,810
I didn't ask for any of this!
Yeah, man!

1141
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:37,011
Just stay out of this!

1142
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:38,445
She's staying with me!
Let go of her!

1143
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:41,081
She is not staying with you!
Cassie, you stay the fuck out of this!

1144
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:42,149
Let go of her!

1145
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,250
Cassie, I'm warning you!

1146
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:48,963
Cassie?

1147
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,491
Cassie!

1148
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:51,966
No!

1149
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:47,716
Stop the car.

1150
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:52,753
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1151
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,521
Get down! Get down!
Please, stop!

1152
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:57,362
Get the fuck down! Do you
think I fucking wanted this?

1153
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:00,198
I just shot my fucking sister!

1154
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:06,634
Dad!

1155
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:30,929
Just stop the car!

1156
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:36,030
Dispatch, tell the operator of the
intercoastal bridge, to open the bridge.

1157
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:37,403
Repeat. Open the bridge.

1158
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:53,686
No!
Fuck it!

1159
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:22,780
God damn it.

1160
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,456
Close the bridge!
Close the bridge!

1161
01:31:26,247 --> 01:31:29,350
Dad! Dad, you okay?

1162
01:31:29,351 --> 01:31:30,818
No, stop please. Just...

1163
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,579
Nobody shoots, there's
a child on the bridge.

1164
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:35,189
Stop, please!
Don't hurt him.

1165
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:37,458
Daddy! Stop!

1166
01:31:37,459 --> 01:31:40,194
Dad, are you okay? Dad.

1167
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:41,862
Get back in the car, right now!

1168
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:44,131
I don't want you to see this!
Get in the fucking car!

1169
01:31:44,132 --> 01:31:45,366
You don't have to do that!
Just stop it!

1170
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:46,467
Pop that trunk.
Please, just stop it!

1171
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:48,002
Get the fuck in the car!

1172
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:49,770
Just leave him alone, please?
Get in the fucking car!

1173
01:31:49,771 --> 01:31:51,472
Please! Daddy, I'm scared!

1174
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:54,051
Get in the car before I blow
your fucking brains out!

1175
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:56,245
God damn it.

1176
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:16,505
You smell the wood burning, Bodine?

1177
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:20,612
You smell the fucking wood burning?

1178
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,279
Now you connecting the dots?

1179
01:32:28,143 --> 01:32:30,118
I'll teach you about reputation.

1180
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:04,721
She just saved your life.

1181
01:33:56,164 --> 01:33:58,105
Let's go home, Maddy.

1182
01:35:01,663 --> 01:35:04,070
<i>See you on the outside, Danny.</i>

1183
01:35:06,968 --> 01:35:08,545
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>
