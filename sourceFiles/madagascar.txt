2
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:18,916
Surprise!

3
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,437
Alex. Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming.

4
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,766
When a zebra's in the zone,
leave him alone.

5
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,738
Come on, Marty. Just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

6
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:33,933
Hey, man, thanks.

7
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:38,909
Hey, I got something
stuck in my teeth.

8
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,778
It's driving me crazy.
Can you help me? Please?

9
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,182
You came to the right place, my friend.

10
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:47,312
Dr. Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.

11
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:52,417
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

12
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:56,689
- I don't see anything.
- It's on the left.

13
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:57,992
Oh, sorry.

14
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:00,625
Okay, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

15
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:05,238
Right here. What the heck
is this doing in there?

16
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:06,739
Happy birthday!

17
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:09,207
Aw, hey, thanks, man.

18
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:12,404
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

19
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,539
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out.

20
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:20,245
- Look at that. Ooh! Look at that.
- Look at that. It's snowing.

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,811
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

22
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:25,187
Double digits. The big 1-0.

23
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:28,987
You don't like it?

24
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:31,326
- No, no, it's great.
- You hate it.

25
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:35,163
I should've gotten you the Alex
alarm clock. That's the big seller.

26
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:38,169
No, no, no.
The present's great, really.

27
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:40,935
It's just that
another year's come and gone

28
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:43,065
and I'm still doing
the same old thing.

29
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:47,976
"Stand over here. Trot over there.
Eat some grass. Walk back over here."

30
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:50,810
- I see your problem.
- Maybe I should go to law school.

31
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:53,578
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

32
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,552
- How?
- Throw out the old act.

33
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,919
Who knows what you'll do.
Make it up as you go along.

34
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:01,653
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

35
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:03,990
- Really?
- You know, make it fresh.

36
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,461
Fresh, huh? Okay.
I could do fresh.

37
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,588
Works for me.

38
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:14,869
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

39
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,668
It's fun people fun time!

40
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:20,541
Let's go, Gloria!
Up and at 'em. We're open!

41
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:22,603
What day is it?

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,080
It's Friday. Field trip day.

43
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:28,413
Yes, it's field trip day.
Let's get up and go...

44
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,212
...in ten more minutes.

45
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,180
Come on!

46
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,157
Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

47
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:40,492
Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another
fabulous morning in the Big Apple.

48
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:41,894
Let's go.

49
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:44,957
- Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
- What?

50
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:49,028
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here. See?

51
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,129
Right there. You see?

52
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:54,334
Melman, you know
it's all in your head. Hm?

53
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,241
Let's go! Come on!

54
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:12,115
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.

55
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:17,654
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

56
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:21,532
Straight out the ground.
Tasty fresh! Freshalicious.

57
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:24,865
Ziploc fresh.

58
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,601
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

59
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,007
the Central Park Zoo
proudly presents:

60
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:31,909
Show them the cat. Who's the cat?

61
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,277
The king of New York City.

62
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:36,872
Alex the lion.

63
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,148
It's showtime.

64
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:45,748
Roar!

65
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:59,535
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

66
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:03,336
Check out the zebra
taking care of biz. That's right.

67
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,337
Just smile and wave, boys.

68
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,275
Smile and wave.

69
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:43,541
Kowalski, progress report.

70
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:46,277
We're 500 feet from the main sewer line.

71
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,342
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

72
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:50,750
Right.

73
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:54,381
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

74
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:58,961
And find more Popsicle sticks.
We don't want to risk another cave-in.

75
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,291
And me, skipper?

76
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:03,424
I want you to look
cute and cuddly, private.

77
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,866
Today we're going to blow this dump.

78
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,598
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

79
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,506
Yeah! You don't
see that on Animal Planet.

80
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,305
Ha-ha.

81
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,316
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

82
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:23,716
I hope you thought it was fresh.

83
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:25,310
I'll be here all week.

84
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:27,982
In fact, I'll be here
for my whole life.

85
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:30,389
Three hundred
and sixty-five days a year,

86
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:34,461
including Christmas,
Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa.

87
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:38,056
Please don't forget
to never spay or neuter your pets.

88
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:42,066
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

89
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:51,910
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

90
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,572
I sprechen.

91
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:56,810
- What continent is this?
- Manhattan.

92
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,819
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.

93
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,117
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

94
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,453
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.

95
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,959
What are you guys doing?

96
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,858
We're digging to Antarctica.

97
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,094
Ant-who-tica?

98
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,757
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

99
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:22,135
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

100
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:27,271
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

101
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,646
This is all some kind
of whacked-out conspiracy.

102
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,744
We're going to the
wide-open spaces of Antarctica.

103
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,254
To the wild.

104
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,724
The wild?
You could actually go there?

105
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,124
That sounds great.

106
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,889
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

107
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,533
You didn't see anything.

108
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:53,628
Right?

109
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,400
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,135
I'm sorry. No, sir.

111
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:01,708
For his final appearance of the day,

112
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,872
the king of New York City.

113
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,607
Alex the lion.

114
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:08,478
Roar!

115
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:14,214
Thank you. Thank you very much.

116
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,921
You guys are great. You're a
great crowd. Give yourselves a hand.

117
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:20,293
Thank you. Oh. Thank you.

118
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:22,093
Oh! Well. Thank you.

119
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,498
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

120
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,297
Underpants!

121
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:31,499
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

122
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:34,166
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

123
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,510
This is the life.

124
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:46,717
That's the spot.

125
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,621
Oh! I'm in heaven.

126
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,196
- Ooh, it's Marty's birthday.
- Just rip it open.

127
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,433
- What is it?
- Come on. Open it up. What you got?

128
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:05,803
A thermometer.

129
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:09,742
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.

130
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:15,309
I wanted to give you something personal.
That was my first rectal thermometer.

131
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:17,476
- Mother...
- I'll miss that bad boy.

132
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:19,247
Get the cake. Melman, come on.

133
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:24,822
Happy birthday to you

134
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:26,826
You live in a zoo

135
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,226
You look like a monkey

136
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:32,130
And you smell like one too

137
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:35,333
I say.

138
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:39,938
Aw, well, now, you guys
are just embarrassing me.

139
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:41,337
And yourselves.

140
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,808
What? We worked
on that all week.

141
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:46,675
Let's go.
Let's make a wish, babycakes.

142
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:55,253
- What'd you wish for?
- Nope. Can't tell you that.

143
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:56,482
Come on. Tell.

144
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,888
No siree.
I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

145
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,325
You want some bad luck,
I'll blab it out.

146
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:04,227
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

147
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,856
Would you just tell us?
What could happen?

148
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,194
Okay.

149
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:12,567
I wished I could go to the wild!

150
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:13,866
The wild?!

151
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:19,268
I told you it was bad luck.

152
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:22,978
The wild? Are you nuts?

153
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:26,142
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

154
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:29,943
It's unsanitary.

155
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,115
The penguins are going.
So why can't I?

156
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:34,715
The penguins are psychotic.

157
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:38,194
Come on. Just imagine
going back to nature.

158
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,256
Back to your roots.
Clean air, wide-open spaces!

159
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,801
I hear there's
wide-open spaces in Connecticut.

160
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:48,236
- Connecticut?
- You got to go over to Grand Central.

161
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:51,570
Then you got to take
the Metro-North train... north?

162
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:55,874
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

163
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,847
Come on. What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

164
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,816
- Lyme disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

165
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:02,112
No, I just want...

166
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,120
There's none of this in the wild.

167
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:07,589
This is a highly
refined type of food thing

168
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:09,489
that you do not find in the wild.

169
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,791
You ever thought there might
be more to life than steak, Alex?

170
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:15,729
He didn't mean that, baby.
No, no, no.

171
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:19,666
Doesn't it bother you guys
that you don't know anything

172
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:21,930
about life outside this zoo?

173
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,068
- Nuh-uh. Nope.
- Mm-mm.

174
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:28,770
Well, I mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

175
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:32,573
You got a little schmutz
right there on your<i>...</i>

176
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:41,578
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for the party. It was great.

177
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:42,884
Really.

178
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:51,859
What's eating him?

179
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:55,869
Maybe you should talk to him.
Go over and give him a little pep talk.

180
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,804
Hey, I already gave him
a snow globe. I can't top that.

181
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:03,042
I can see where this is going.

182
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:06,742
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

183
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:19,317
Come on. He's your best friend.

184
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:22,385
All right, all right. Okay.

185
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:25,056
- Night, Marty.
- Night, Glo.

186
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,715
What a day.

187
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:54,452
I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't
get any better than this, you know?

188
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:58,889
Ooh! It just did. Even the star's out.

189
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:02,931
Not going to find a star
like that in the wild.

190
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,025
Helicopter.

191
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:09,666
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

192
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,836
Everybody has days when they think the
grass might be greener somewhere else.

193
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:15,037
Alex.

194
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,375
Look at me.

195
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,440
I'm ten years old.
My life is half over.

196
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:24,318
And I don't even know
if I'm black with white stripes...

197
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,447
...or white with black stripes.

198
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:33,356
Marty.

199
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,763
I'm thinking of a song.

200
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,698
Alex. Please. Not now.

201
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:42,636
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

202
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,867
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
No, no, no.

203
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:48,467
I'm not listening.

204
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,111
Start spreadin' the news

205
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,274
I don't know you.

206
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,046
I'm leaving today

207
00:13:56,119 --> 00:14:00,817
- We are a great big part of it
- He's funny. Who is that?

208
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:04,386
Come on. You know
you know the words.

209
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,553
Two little words.

210
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:07,823
New York.

211
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:09,523
New York

212
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,726
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

213
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,632
We're not all nocturnal, you know!

214
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:17,263
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.

215
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,568
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

216
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,508
You mess with him,
you mess with me, Howard.

217
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:26,240
- You're a bigmouth lion.
- See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

218
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,612
We make a great team, the two of us.

219
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:31,345
We sure do. No doubt about it.

220
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:35,014
So, what are you going to do? Go
running off to the wild by yourself?

221
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:36,113
- No.
- Good.

222
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,817
You and me. Let's go.

223
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,018
- What?
- The wild.

224
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:41,391
Come on. You and me together.

225
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:44,897
It's a straight shot
down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.

226
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,956
We'll grab a train, we'll head north.

227
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:49,696
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

228
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,000
You're joking. Right?

229
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,574
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course
I'm joking. Give me a break.

230
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,307
Like we're going to get a train.

231
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:05,613
Don't do that. You really
had me worried there.

232
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:09,644
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.

233
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:13,283
Yeah, me too. I'll need
to rest my voice for tomorrow.

234
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,024
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

235
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:19,929
Give them a little jolt. You know?

236
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,134
Good night, AllyAI.

237
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:35,742
They forgot to turn off
the ambience again.

238
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:37,907
Don't worry. It's cool.

239
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:40,351
You know, I got it.

240
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,183
Much better.

241
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:14,549
Come on, now, baby.

242
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:16,710
My little filet.

243
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:20,017
My little filet mignon
with a little fat around the edges.

244
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,991
I like that. I like
a little fat on my steak.

245
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,360
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

246
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:31,161
Alex. Alex. Alex!

247
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:32,531
What? What?

248
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:33,728
You suck your thumb?

249
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,696
What is it, Melman?

250
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:38,673
You know how I have
that bladder infection

251
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:40,605
and I have to get up
every two hours?

252
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:45,044
I got up to pee and looked over at
Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.

253
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:47,047
I don't know why, but I did. And...

254
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,605
What? What's going on?

255
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:50,480
It's Marty. He's gone.

256
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,214
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

257
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,950
How long has he been working on this?

258
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:57,286
Marty!

259
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,724
Marty!

260
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:00,523
He wouldn't fit down there.

261
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,358
Marty? Marty! Marty!

262
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,023
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

263
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:09,595
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

264
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,639
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

265
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:15,197
I mean, we got to call somebody!

266
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,914
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

267
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:25,713
We've got a lost zebra probably on
the way to Connecticut, and we need...

268
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,885
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second.

269
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:33,448
- We can't call the people.
- What the...?

270
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:36,655
They'll be really mad.

271
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:40,426
It'll get Marty transferred for good.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

272
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,933
Mm-hm, I know that's right.

273
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:44,561
We got to go after him.
He's not thinking straight.

274
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:47,606
Let's stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

275
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:52,804
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

276
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:55,474
Poor little guy.

277
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:18,626
Come on.

278
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:21,171
One of us should wait here
in case he comes back.

279
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,470
Not now. This is an intervention.
We all got to go.

280
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,703
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

281
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:28,802
- You should take Lexington.
- Melman!

282
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,441
- Okay. "We." We should take Lexington.
- What about Park?

283
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:35,110
No, Park goes two ways.
You can't time the lights.

284
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:40,117
I heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Center.

285
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:44,988
Well, of course we're
going to throw poo at him.

286
00:18:53,703 --> 00:18:55,034
We should've taken Park.

287
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:58,233
You sure this is the fastest way
to Grand Central Station?

288
00:18:58,308 --> 00:19:00,400
I don't know!
That's what Melman said.

289
00:19:00,476 --> 00:19:02,034
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

290
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:05,842
That room has some nifty little
sinks you can wash up in, and look!

291
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,610
Free mints!

292
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,116
This isn't a field trip.

293
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:12,711
This is an urgent mission to save
Marty from throwing his life away.

294
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:14,278
Now, where's the train?

295
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,051
Here it comes.

296
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,994
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him.

297
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:26,625
I did! I did! I don't understand.
He said, "Let's go."

298
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:29,693
I said, "Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old."

299
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:33,571
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

300
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:42,380
What you got to do is go
straight back down West 42nd.

301
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,645
It's on your left after Vanderbilt.

302
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,983
If you hit the Chrysler Building,
you've gone too far.

303
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:49,579
Thanks a lot, officer.

304
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,793
Hey! Wait for the light.

305
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:55,885
Freak.

306
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,693
- Did you say "zebra"?
- That's right. A zebra.

307
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,198
Right in front of me.

308
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,791
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

309
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:04,463
Then I'm going to need some backup.

310
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,348
- Aw! Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

311
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,876
Did that say "Grand Central
Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?

312
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,944
This is it.

313
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,459
Grand Central Station.

314
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,963
It's grand and it's central.

315
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,540
Move aside. We have an emergency here.
This is an emergency situation.

316
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:57,485
Hey, hey. Just chill out.
It's not that big of an emergency.

317
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:58,987
Upstairs, downstairs.

318
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:00,987
How do you like that?

319
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,726
Lady! What is wrong with you?

320
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:08,888
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.

321
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:10,456
You're a bad kitty.

322
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:15,171
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

323
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,140
Looks like I'll have
to take the Stamford local.

324
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,970
I got him! I've got him!

325
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:21,135
He's got him!

326
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,440
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got...

327
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:24,946
I got something for you!

328
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:30,047
I'm okay. I'm okay.

329
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,587
Whoa! What are
you guys doing here?

330
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:36,421
- I am so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

331
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:39,893
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

332
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:43,021
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

333
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:45,828
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

334
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:47,528
Because I was wondering...

335
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:50,662
How could you do this to us?
I thought we were your friends!

336
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,003
What's the big deal?
I was coming back.

337
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:55,202
Don't ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

338
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:58,007
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time.

339
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,945
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

340
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:03,451
...do this again! Don't you ever,
ever do this again!

341
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:04,979
Come here.

342
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,855
We've been ratted out, boys.

343
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:15,452
Hold your fire!

344
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:24,498
Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

345
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,808
If you have any poo, fling it now.

346
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:35,046
It's the Man.

347
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,243
Good evening, officers.

348
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:40,479
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?

349
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:43,113
You're not good with the
"putting words together

350
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:45,919
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh."

351
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:49,484
Hey! How you doing?
You know what? Everything's cool.

352
00:22:49,562 --> 00:22:53,429
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

353
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:56,468
My friend went a little crazy.
Happens to everybody.

354
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:59,595
The city gets to us all.
Went a little cuckoo in the head.

355
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,605
Don't be calling me
cuckoo in the head.

356
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:05,541
Just shush! I will handle this.

357
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:06,873
Oh! I got him!

358
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,879
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

359
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:11,040
Would you give a guy a break?

360
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:16,713
We'll take my little friend home and
forget this ever happened. All right?

361
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:20,188
No harm, no foul, right?

362
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:24,661
Hey, it's cool. It's me,
Alex the lion. From the zoo.

363
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,000
What's the matter with them?

364
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:44,340
I feel really, really weird.

365
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,883
I love you guys.

366
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,683
I love you so much.

367
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:15,175
Last night's dramatic incident
in Grand Central

368
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:19,111
is an example of what animal rights
wackos have been shouting for years:

369
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,206
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

370
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:25,276
They are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

371
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:28,844
where they will live their lives
in the freedom they desire.

372
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:31,915
- Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

373
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:33,816
Do something!

374
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:36,392
Oh, man.

375
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,798
Oh, my head.

376
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:53,777
What the...?

377
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:56,280
Wait. Where? What?

378
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,780
I'm in a box! Oh, no.
No, no! Not the box.

379
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:04,448
Oh, no, they can't
transfer me. Not me!

380
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:07,516
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

381
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:09,561
Darkness creeping in.

382
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:11,893
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

383
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:14,091
Walls closing in around me.

384
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,460
So alone. So alone.

385
00:25:17,536 --> 00:25:20,471
- Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

386
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:23,804
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

387
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,708
- What's going on? You okay?
- This doesn't look good.

388
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:28,837
- Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

389
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:32,042
- You're here too!
- I am loving the sound of your voice.

390
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:34,381
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

391
00:25:34,453 --> 00:25:35,579
Oh, no!

392
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,287
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

393
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:40,449
Is that Melman?

394
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:43,254
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

395
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:46,160
I often doze off
while I'm getting an MRI.

396
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,063
- You're not getting an MRI.
- CAT scan?

397
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:52,000
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

398
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:55,527
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no.
No, no, I can't be transferred.

399
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:58,200
I have an appointment
with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

400
00:25:58,275 --> 00:26:00,936
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

401
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:03,605
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

402
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,272
And I am not going HMO.

403
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:08,112
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be okay.

404
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:12,780
- We are going to be okizay.
- No, we're not going to be okizay.

405
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:14,983
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

406
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:18,585
Because of me? I fail
to see how this is my fault.

407
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:22,062
- You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

408
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:24,656
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

409
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:29,261
"I don't know who I am. I got to go
find myself in the wild." Oh, please.

410
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,569
I did not ask you
to come after me, did I?

411
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,302
He does have a point.

412
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:37,470
I did say we should stay at the zoo,
but you guys...

413
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:38,672
Melman, just shut it.

414
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:41,409
You suggested this idea
to him in the first place.

415
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:43,951
- Leave Melman out of this.
- Thank you, Gloria.

416
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,882
Besides, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

417
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:49,718
Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

418
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:53,625
- I feel nauseous.
- Melman, you always feel nauseous.

419
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,459
Progress report.

420
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,698
It's an older code, skipper.
I can't make it out.

421
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:05,898
You, higher mammal.

422
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:07,406
Can you read?

423
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:10,637
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

424
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:17,944
Ship to Kenya.

425
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:20,680
Wildlife preserve.

426
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:21,846
Africa!

427
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:25,085
Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico.

428
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:10,327
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

429
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:12,869
- Guys, listen.
- A king. Loved by my people.

430
00:28:12,937 --> 00:28:15,633
- Let's be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

431
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:16,799
"Loved"?

432
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:21,106
If the people loved you, it's only
because they didn't know the real you!

433
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:24,238
Don't make me come up there.
I'll whoop both of y'all.

434
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:25,804
I thought I knew the real you!

435
00:28:25,883 --> 00:28:30,786
Your black-and-white stripes, they
cancel each other out. You're nothing!

436
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:32,481
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

437
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:34,683
You're not helping the situation.

438
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:36,521
Status.

439
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:39,824
It's no good.
I don't know the codes.

440
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:43,627
Don't give me excuses.
Give me results! Navigation.

441
00:28:46,969 --> 00:28:49,369
All right. Let me think.

442
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,065
And shut him up!

443
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,543
- I did it!
- Let's get this tin can turned around.

444
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:25,266
Guys?

445
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:27,433
Oh, no.

446
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:28,769
Gloria!

447
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:30,103
Melman!

448
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:31,335
Marty!

449
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,075
Alex!

450
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:35,673
Marty?!

451
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,478
Alex!

452
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:39,849
Marty!

453
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,889
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

454
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,957
Don't go.

455
00:30:30,736 --> 00:30:32,169
Marty?

456
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:34,705
Melman?

457
00:30:35,974 --> 00:30:37,339
Gloria?

458
00:30:41,178 --> 00:30:42,406
Marty?!

459
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,742
Melman?!

460
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:45,338
Gloria?!

461
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:48,607
Marty!

462
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:52,756
Melman! Gloria!

463
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:56,549
Hey, anyone! Hello!

464
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:04,058
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

465
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:08,193
Gloria, Melman, Marty.
Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.

466
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:10,796
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.

467
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:12,774
Matt, Katie, Al.

468
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,511
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

469
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,645
Get me out of this thing right now!

470
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:26,212
Hello? Somebody?

471
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:27,550
Melman!

472
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:29,488
Alex? Is that you?

473
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:33,585
Melman, I got you. Hang on!
Hang on. I got you.

474
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,364
Melman! I got you, buddy.

475
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:49,601
Wait a sec, Melman.
Wait right there.

476
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:53,079
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you out of the box.

477
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,743
- Relax.
- Alex?

478
00:31:57,752 --> 00:32:00,346
Giraffe, corner pocket!

479
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:02,655
Here goes nothing!

480
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:04,851
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold still!

481
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:06,518
- Wait, Alex.
- Hold still.

482
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:08,653
- No, come on.
- Here I come!

483
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,595
Look! Look! Look! Look!

484
00:32:10,665 --> 00:32:13,758
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

485
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:17,162
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

486
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:18,329
Oh, my...

487
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:19,804
Gloria!

488
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,071
Gloria!

489
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:36,811
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

490
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:37,981
Gloria!

491
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,524
Alex!

492
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,886
- Marty?!
- Marty!

493
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:48,161
Yeah! All right! That's right!

494
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:52,193
Left! Left! Left. No, no,
your left! Your left! Your left!

495
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,873
Right here's good.

496
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:59,008
I don't have anything on me
right now. I'll have to get you later.

497
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,348
To you too.

498
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,010
Marty!

499
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,417
Marty!

500
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,613
Alex!

501
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,058
Marty!

502
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,687
Alex!

503
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,095
Marty!

504
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,428
Al!

505
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,831
Marty!

506
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,995
Alex?

507
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,560
Marty!

508
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,872
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

509
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:34,001
Martin!

510
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:35,806
- Hold up!
- I'm going to kill you!

511
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:38,780
- Come here! Don't run away from me!
- Calm down!

512
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,875
If you keep running,
I'm going to just kill you more!

513
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,344
Oh, look at us.

514
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:47,787
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

515
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:49,848
Yeah, here we are.

516
00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:53,794
Where exactly is "here"?

517
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,133
San Diego.

518
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:09,768
San Diego?

519
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:11,403
White sandy beaches,

520
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,644
cleverly simulated natural
environment, wide-open enclosures.

521
00:34:15,717 --> 00:34:18,777
I'm telling you,
this could be the San Diego Zoo.

522
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:20,981
Complete with fake rocks.

523
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,819
Wow, that looks real.

524
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:27,123
San Diego? What could
be worse than San Diego?

525
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:30,323
I don't know.
This place is crackalacking!

526
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,560
Oh, I could hang here.
I could hang here.

527
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,295
- I'll kill you!
- Take it easy!

528
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:36,996
- Strangle you!
- Calm down.

529
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:40,165
Then bury you, dig you up,
clone you and kill your clones.

530
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:43,108
- 20-second timeout.
- I'll never talk to you again.

531
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:45,645
Now, look. We're just
going to find the people,

532
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:50,275
get checked in
and have this mess straightened out.

533
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:54,043
Oh, great.
This is just great. San Diego.

534
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:58,079
Now I'll have to compete
with Shamu and his smug little grin.

535
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:00,182
I can't top that. Can't top it.

536
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,821
I'm ruined! I'm done.
I'm out of the business.

537
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:07,128
It's your fault, Marty!
You've ruined me.

538
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,862
Come on, Alex.
Do you honestly think

539
00:35:09,936 --> 00:35:12,268
I intended all of this to happen?

540
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:15,273
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

541
00:35:15,341 --> 00:35:16,330
Okay, I'm...

542
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:19,010
He just shushed me.

543
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:22,205
Marty, look, you've got
to be just a little bit more und...

544
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:26,683
- Don't you shush me.
- Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?

545
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:32,490
- I hear it now.
- Where there's music, there's people.

546
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:35,152
- Go to the head honcho.
- A sidewalk would be nice.

547
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:36,785
Yeah, what a dump.

548
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:39,126
They should call it
the San Di-lame-o Zoo.

549
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:44,395
First they tell you, "We got this great
open plan thing. Let animals run wild."

550
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:48,063
Next thing, flowers in your hair,
everybody's hugging everybody.

551
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:51,506
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

552
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,581
What the...?

553
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,449
Oh, no!

554
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:21,799
Okay, let's make
a good impression on the people.

555
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:24,863
Smiles, everyone.
Let's get it together.

556
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:28,433
- Is that the best you can do?
- Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

557
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:30,808
Well, great. Let's make gas look good.

558
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,153
- Wow!
- It's not people. It's animals.

559
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:43,589
California animals. Dude.

560
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,422
This is like a Puffy party.

561
00:36:46,195 --> 00:36:49,687
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

562
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:51,756
- Ya like to
- Move it

563
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,325
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

564
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,166
I like to move it, move it

565
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:59,229
- Ya like to
- Move it

566
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:02,674
I like to move it, move it
You like to move it, move it

567
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:04,473
She like to move it, move it

568
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:06,069
- He like to
- Move it

569
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:08,741
All girls all over the world

570
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:12,081
Original King Julien
'pon yer case, man

571
00:37:12,153 --> 00:37:15,554
I love how all the girls
that love to move their body

572
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:17,613
When ya move your body, ya do

573
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:20,922
Move it nice
and sweet and sassy, all right

574
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:22,427
What kind of zoo is this?

575
00:37:22,496 --> 00:37:25,863
I just saw 26 blatant
health code violations.

576
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:28,992
I'm loving San Diego.
This place is off the chizain.

577
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:30,127
Twenty-seven.

578
00:37:31,638 --> 00:37:33,697
Woman, physically fit, physically fit

579
00:37:33,774 --> 00:37:37,676
Physically, physically, physically fit
Physically fit, Physically fit

580
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:40,007
We should've brought chips and dip.

581
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,307
Wait.

582
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,180
Where's Alex? What happened to him?
He was right behind us. Wasn't he?

583
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:48,584
I don't know where he's at,
but he's missing one heck of a party.

584
00:37:48,654 --> 00:37:50,349
The fossa!

585
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:51,822
The fossa!

586
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:54,621
The fossa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

587
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:04,363
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

588
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:08,432
I hate spiderwebs.

589
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:10,440
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

590
00:38:10,508 --> 00:38:13,705
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

591
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:20,617
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

592
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:24,018
Because we've been sitting
on that beach back there for hours,

593
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:26,522
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

594
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,957
I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

595
00:38:30,027 --> 00:38:33,155
but there's been some sort
of major screwup, which is cool.

596
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,098
So if you could point us towards
the administrative offices, we'll...

597
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:38,156
Well, howdy-do.

598
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:47,742
Spider! Spider! Spider on my back!

599
00:38:47,811 --> 00:38:50,904
Maurice, did you see that?

600
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,210
He scared the fossa away.

601
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,351
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

602
00:38:57,186 --> 00:38:59,313
Get it! Get it! Get it!

603
00:38:59,388 --> 00:39:02,016
- That's it! Smack it!
- Get it, get it!

604
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,252
Whip it! Whip it good!
Where'd it go?

605
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:08,525
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?!

606
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:13,557
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

607
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:18,095
They've come to kill us. And take
our women. And our precious metals.

608
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,873
Get up, Mort. Do not
be near the king's feet, okay?

609
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:27,481
We're hiding. Be quiet,
everyone. Including me.

610
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:29,278
Who's making that noise?

611
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:30,545
Oh, it's me again.

612
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,849
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

613
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:36,219
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- I think she got it.

614
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,724
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

615
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,957
It's okay. It's gone.

616
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:43,588
They are savages.

617
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:44,892
Tonight we die.

618
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,059
The feet. I told you...
I told you to... I told every...

619
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,035
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

620
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:53,265
He did tell you about the feet.

621
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:57,768
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

622
00:39:57,845 --> 00:40:00,210
I have devised a cunning test

623
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,011
to see whether
these are savage killers.

624
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:11,586
Hi there.

625
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:16,152
You let me handle it.
Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

626
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:21,990
Hi there.

627
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,136
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

628
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:32,371
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.

629
00:40:32,444 --> 00:40:36,107
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

630
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:42,312
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

631
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:45,015
Did that big mean lion scare you?

632
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,526
He did? He's a big,
bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

633
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:52,757
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Aww, look at you.

634
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,128
They are so cute
from a reasonable distance.

635
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,636
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

636
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:02,605
They're just a bunch of pansies.

637
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:04,004
I don't know.

638
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,976
There's something
about that one with the crazy hairdo

639
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:09,170
that I find suspicious.

640
00:41:09,246 --> 00:41:10,804
Nonsense, Maurice.

641
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:14,942
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

642
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:30,124
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien Xlll,

643
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,828
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
et cetera. Hooray, everybody.

644
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,199
He's got style.

645
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,542
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

646
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,022
I think it's a squirrel.

647
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,252
Welcome, giant pansies.

648
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:01,090
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

649
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:03,596
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep. Squirrel.

650
00:42:03,665 --> 00:42:07,999
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the fossa.

651
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:10,128
- The "whossa"?
- The fossa.

652
00:42:10,271 --> 00:42:14,207
They annoy us by trespassing,
interrupting our parties

653
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:16,209
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Good.

654
00:42:16,277 --> 00:42:19,268
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

655
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:21,473
What big teeth you have. Man!

656
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:25,814
Shame on you, Maurice. Can you not
see that you have insulted the freak?

657
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,945
You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

658
00:42:29,022 --> 00:42:33,118
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

659
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:36,458
And just where are you giants from?

660
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,623
We're from New York and...

661
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,394
All hail the New York giants!

662
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:43,731
New York giants!

663
00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:48,269
Is this some sort of
inbreeding program?

664
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:51,435
I say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

665
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,843
Excuse me. We bozos
have the people, of course.

666
00:42:55,414 --> 00:42:57,974
Hey, the bozos have the people.

667
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,577
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

668
00:43:01,654 --> 00:43:03,087
They're up there.

669
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:10,955
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

670
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:12,121
Wow.

671
00:43:12,197 --> 00:43:14,961
So do you have any live people?

672
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:17,832
No. Only dead ones.

673
00:43:17,902 --> 00:43:20,871
I mean, if we had
a lot of live people here,

674
00:43:20,939 --> 00:43:24,500
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it?

675
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:25,873
The wild?

676
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:29,038
Whoa. Hold up there
a second, fuzzbucket.

677
00:43:29,114 --> 00:43:30,444
You mean, like,

678
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:35,108
the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

679
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:37,779
- Who wipes?
- Oy vey.

680
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,584
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

681
00:43:39,656 --> 00:43:41,590
Oy vey!

682
00:43:41,658 --> 00:43:44,024
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

683
00:43:48,432 --> 00:43:51,697
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

684
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,630
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

685
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:56,831
I'm swimming back to New York.

686
00:43:56,906 --> 00:43:59,898
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

687
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:03,537
- You can't swim!
- I said my chances are slim!

688
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:08,448
Nature! It's all over me!
Get it off! I can't see! I can't see!

689
00:44:10,153 --> 00:44:12,053
I can see!

690
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:16,354
Look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

691
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:18,985
The people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

692
00:44:19,061 --> 00:44:23,259
As soon as they realize what happened,
they'll come looking for us, right?

693
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:24,457
Yeah, right.

694
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:28,560
I don't know the words
But we're born free

695
00:44:28,637 --> 00:44:32,198
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

696
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:43,074
Well, boys, it's going
to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

697
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,553
Rico.

698
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:54,352
Well, since I'm doomed
to die on this forsaken island,

699
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:56,726
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

700
00:44:56,797 --> 00:45:00,164
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

701
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:04,431
have divided my estate
equally among the three of you.

702
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:06,932
Sorry, Alex.

703
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:11,670
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

704
00:45:11,744 --> 00:45:13,644
No, it's not a latrine.

705
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:17,979
It's a grave. You sent Melman
to his grave. Are you happy?

706
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:19,382
Aw, come on.

707
00:45:19,452 --> 00:45:22,888
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

708
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:25,220
This could be the best that's happened.

709
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:27,315
No. No. No. No.

710
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:31,886
No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not
the best thing that's happened to us.

711
00:45:31,964 --> 00:45:35,866
You abused the power of the birthday
wish and brought bad luck on all of us.

712
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,528
Why'd you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to.

713
00:45:38,604 --> 00:45:41,232
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

714
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:44,798
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, okay.

715
00:45:44,877 --> 00:45:48,540
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

716
00:45:48,614 --> 00:45:51,446
Look around. There's no fences,
no schedules.

717
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,984
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

718
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,576
Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this.

719
00:45:56,654 --> 00:46:01,591
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

720
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,355
That is the bad side,
where you can prance and skip

721
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,920
like a magical pixie horse
and do whatever the heck you want.

722
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:11,958
This is the good side for those who
love New York and care about going home.

723
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,799
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

724
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:16,634
You know what? This isn't good.

725
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:21,040
Okay! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

726
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,978
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

727
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,983
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

728
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,575
This is the fun side,

729
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,952
where we'll have a great time
surviving until we go home.

730
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,753
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- This side's the best.

731
00:46:35,824 --> 00:46:39,351
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this cesspool!

732
00:46:39,428 --> 00:46:41,658
- Wilma!
- Now what do we do?

733
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,164
Don't worry. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

734
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:50,395
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

735
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:57,301
Just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

736
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:08,449
Shut up, Spalding.

737
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:16,621
I've been standing
here for hours, man.

738
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:19,360
How long do I have
to pose like this?

739
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:22,567
She is finito.

740
00:47:23,403 --> 00:47:27,271
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles

741
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:29,400
to miss this baby.

742
00:47:29,476 --> 00:47:33,674
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

743
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:37,478
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

744
00:47:37,551 --> 00:47:40,543
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

745
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:43,647
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman?
- Great. Idiot.

746
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:45,214
I heard that.

747
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:47,885
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

748
00:47:49,195 --> 00:47:53,188
That's wild fire. We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

749
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:56,133
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

750
00:47:56,202 --> 00:48:00,798
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it!

751
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:03,266
Fire.

752
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:05,466
Fire.

753
00:48:07,046 --> 00:48:09,206
Fire! Fire!

754
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:14,344
Oh, my

755
00:48:14,919 --> 00:48:16,011
Fire!

756
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:17,952
Not yet! No, no! No!

757
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,513
Fire!

758
00:48:19,591 --> 00:48:21,024
Melman, hold still!

759
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,757
Jump! Alex, jump!

760
00:48:23,828 --> 00:48:26,092
Don't worry,
cats always land on their...

761
00:48:27,098 --> 00:48:29,965
Face? Man,
what kind of cat are you?

762
00:48:38,642 --> 00:48:40,542
You maniac!

763
00:48:40,978 --> 00:48:43,105
You burned it up!

764
00:48:43,614 --> 00:48:45,445
Darn you!

765
00:48:45,516 --> 00:48:48,383
Darn you all to heck!

766
00:48:48,786 --> 00:48:50,947
Can we go to the fun side now?

767
00:48:52,256 --> 00:48:55,350
Everybody, calm down.
Come on. Into your chairs.

768
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:58,223
Everybody, calm down.
Let go of his tail.

769
00:48:58,294 --> 00:49:00,762
Separate those two,
would you, please?

770
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,593
You here, you there. Everyone...

771
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:06,167
Calm down, people, okay?

772
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:10,501
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

773
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,736
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

774
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,402
Now, everybody,

775
00:49:15,478 --> 00:49:20,176
we all have great curiosity
about our guests, the New York giants.

776
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,148
- Yes, Willie?
- I like them.

777
00:49:22,217 --> 00:49:26,176
I like them. I liked them first.
Before I even met them I liked them.

778
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:30,020
I liked them right away. You hate
them compared to how much I like them.

779
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,356
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

780
00:49:33,495 --> 00:49:36,726
Now, for as long
as we can remember,

781
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:41,599
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded fossa.

782
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,365
The fossa! The fossa are attacking!

783
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:50,333
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

784
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:52,038
Please. Maurice.

785
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:54,877
Quiet!

786
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:59,113
Come on, y'all. They're not
attacking us this very instant.

787
00:50:00,688 --> 00:50:04,021
So my genius plan is this:

788
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:06,490
We will make the New York giants

789
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,460
our friends and keep them close.

790
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:12,828
Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us,

791
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:16,266
we will be safe
and never have to worry

792
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:20,136
about the dreaded fossa ever again.

793
00:50:22,475 --> 00:50:26,468
I thought of that.
I thought of that. Yes. Me. I did.

794
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:29,275
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.
I'm just thinking now.

795
00:50:29,348 --> 00:50:32,181
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the fossa

796
00:50:32,251 --> 00:50:34,845
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

797
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,185
I mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

798
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:41,317
What if Mr. Alex
is even worse than the fossa?

799
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:46,026
I tell you, that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

800
00:50:46,098 --> 00:50:48,589
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

801
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:52,397
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

802
00:50:54,105 --> 00:50:56,869
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

803
00:50:56,941 --> 00:50:59,409
No? Good. So shut up.

804
00:50:59,911 --> 00:51:02,709
When the New York giants wake up,

805
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:08,446
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

806
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:12,119
Now, who would like a cookie?

807
00:51:36,746 --> 00:51:41,614
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

808
00:51:41,684 --> 00:51:44,244
There's room
on the fun side for one more.

809
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,947
No, thanks.

810
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:50,185
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

811
00:51:50,259 --> 00:51:53,251
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

812
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:56,787
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

813
00:51:56,866 --> 00:51:58,766
I just want to go home.

814
00:51:59,935 --> 00:52:03,927
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

815
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:07,740
It really isn't
the fun side without you.

816
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:25,185
I know. And then...

817
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:30,254
- It's him.
- Who is it?

818
00:52:30,764 --> 00:52:34,063
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

819
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,767
Yes? Can I help you?

820
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:38,995
Can I come to the fun side?

821
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:42,733
Beg your pardon?

822
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,740
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.

823
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:52,413
But I've been thinking
about what you said, and I'm sorry.

824
00:52:59,692 --> 00:53:03,355
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

825
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:05,397
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

826
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:14,564
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

827
00:53:21,479 --> 00:53:22,969
Very impressive.

828
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:26,108
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.

829
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:29,148
This is seawater.

830
00:53:30,255 --> 00:53:34,055
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

831
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:36,058
Hey, y'all look hungry.

832
00:53:36,794 --> 00:53:39,820
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

833
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:42,592
You have food?

834
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:45,601
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

835
00:53:46,303 --> 00:53:48,328
Seaweed on a stick.

836
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:49,895
Seaweed?

837
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:53,401
On a stick.
Don't love it till you try it.

838
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,808
That's unbelievable.

839
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,346
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

840
00:54:06,422 --> 00:54:09,289
It does kind of hit the spot,
doesn't it?

841
00:54:10,293 --> 00:54:13,524
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

842
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,800
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

843
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:23,633
Oh, but it does.

844
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:25,830
Check this out.

845
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:35,105
Wow. Would you look at that.

846
00:54:35,183 --> 00:54:39,677
It's like billions
and billions of helicopters.

847
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:42,155
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

848
00:54:42,224 --> 00:54:45,387
Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak?

849
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,983
You know what, Alex?

850
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:51,725
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

851
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:53,096
Thanks, Marty.

852
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:56,227
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

853
00:54:56,303 --> 00:54:58,737
I think I'm going to
hit the sack too.

854
00:54:58,806 --> 00:55:00,671
Sweet dreams, everyone.

855
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,368
Alex.

856
00:55:42,347 --> 00:55:44,076
What are you doing?

857
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:49,411
Twenty-seven, 28, 29.
Thirty black and only 29 white.

858
00:55:49,488 --> 00:55:52,321
Looks like you're black
with white stripes after all.

859
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,915
Dilemma solved. Good night.

860
00:56:04,635 --> 00:56:08,162
You see, Maurice,
Mr. Alex was grooming his friend.

861
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,675
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

862
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,678
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

863
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,409
Look at him.
He's so cute and plushy.

864
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:21,007
I don't think he was grooming him.

865
00:56:21,084 --> 00:56:23,552
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

866
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,953
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

867
00:56:27,023 --> 00:56:31,187
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

868
00:56:31,261 --> 00:56:33,991
All we have to do is wait

869
00:56:34,064 --> 00:56:37,727
until they are deep in their sleep.

870
00:56:43,405 --> 00:56:46,340
How long is this going to take?!

871
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:14,200
Well, this sucks!

872
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:18,134
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

873
00:57:19,274 --> 00:57:21,799
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

874
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,207
Rise and shining.

875
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:27,476
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

876
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:29,015
Wake up! Alex!

877
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,778
You suck your thumb?

878
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:36,415
Where are we?
What the heck is going on?

879
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,754
Where's the beach?
Take it easy.

880
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:41,818
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

881
00:57:41,895 --> 00:57:43,089
While you were asleep,

882
00:57:43,163 --> 00:57:47,327
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

883
00:57:47,401 --> 00:57:49,665
Welcome to Madagascar.

884
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:52,296
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

885
00:57:52,371 --> 00:57:54,737
No, not whooha. Ascar.

886
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:04,076
Marty. It's...

887
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,710
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

888
00:58:06,786 --> 00:58:10,950
Oh, no, fella, that is
the real deal right there.

889
00:58:11,023 --> 00:58:13,082
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

890
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:17,060
That's the thing that you were always
looking at, but it's actually there.

891
00:58:17,195 --> 00:58:20,596
- That's the real version of...
- How about once around the park?

892
00:58:20,765 --> 00:58:24,098
Let's get our blood pumping,
lungs breathing this fresh air.

893
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:25,568
Who's with me?!

894
00:58:25,637 --> 00:58:28,105
Naw. I don't think I could...
You're it!

895
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:29,765
Hey! Want to play around?

896
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,204
Got you there!

897
00:58:33,278 --> 00:58:34,643
Come here!

898
00:58:35,013 --> 00:58:36,207
You're it.

899
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:39,010
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

900
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:42,177
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

901
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:44,744
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

902
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:47,313
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

903
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:49,291
I haven't eaten in two days.

904
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,488
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

905
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:54,428
I don't think that's your problem.

906
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:57,194
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

907
00:58:57,268 --> 00:58:59,236
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!

908
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:01,294
You just have
to let out that inner lion.

909
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,807
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

910
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:08,037
You are, that's who.
Come on! Here we go!

911
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,909
That's it. Let's build up
some steam! You the cat.

912
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,572
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

913
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,241
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

914
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,912
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

915
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:22,117
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

916
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,256
I'm the cat!

917
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:32,533
Surprise!

918
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:41,566
You're it. You're it!

919
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:43,941
Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick.

920
00:59:46,915 --> 00:59:52,250
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

921
00:59:53,254 --> 00:59:56,280
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

922
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:06,127
Man! I feel different.

923
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,499
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

924
01:00:10,972 --> 01:00:13,132
Kind of charged up or something.

925
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:16,004
- Like you said, baby, it's...
- Crackalacking.

926
01:00:16,076 --> 01:00:20,513
- Ain't that right, Melman?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

927
01:00:23,216 --> 01:00:24,774
I'm in heaven.

928
01:00:24,851 --> 01:00:29,788
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend
and the fossas are nowhere to be seen.

929
01:00:29,856 --> 01:00:32,757
It could be said
that my plan is working

930
01:00:32,826 --> 01:00:36,124
in a very good working kind of way.

931
01:00:36,195 --> 01:00:39,323
Alex. You got to try some of this.

932
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:43,434
I feel good.
Feel like a king again.

933
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:45,429
King?

934
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:48,035
You should see his act.

935
01:00:48,107 --> 01:00:51,304
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act.

936
01:00:51,377 --> 01:00:54,278
Oh. No, I really
don't think I could... Okay.

937
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:57,611
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

938
01:00:57,683 --> 01:00:59,809
The wild proudly presents:

939
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:01,351
The king.

940
01:01:01,419 --> 01:01:04,217
Alex the lion!

941
01:01:05,223 --> 01:01:06,485
E flat, fellas.

942
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:18,663
Yeah! The king is in the house!

943
01:01:18,736 --> 01:01:22,603
See, if he is the king, then where
is his crown? I've got a crown.

944
01:01:22,672 --> 01:01:25,800
Got a very nice one.
And it's here on my head.

945
01:01:25,876 --> 01:01:27,844
Look at it. Have I got it on?

946
01:01:34,117 --> 01:01:36,142
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

947
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:44,624
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

948
01:01:44,694 --> 01:01:46,923
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

949
01:01:48,464 --> 01:01:49,692
Break out the wave!

950
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:18,752
Excuse me.

951
01:02:18,827 --> 01:02:21,057
You're biting my butt.

952
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,832
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

953
01:02:27,735 --> 01:02:29,828
- What did you do?
- You just bit me!

954
01:02:29,904 --> 01:02:32,065
No. I didn't. Did I?

955
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,697
You kind of did.

956
01:02:33,774 --> 01:02:35,901
What the heck is wrong with you?

957
01:02:37,644 --> 01:02:38,906
Why'd you bite me?

958
01:02:38,979 --> 01:02:41,777
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.
- What?!

959
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:44,113
- Excuse me?
- That's dumb.

960
01:02:44,184 --> 01:02:48,644
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple
bite on the buttocks among friends?

961
01:02:48,722 --> 01:02:50,587
Here, give me a nibble.

962
01:02:50,657 --> 01:02:54,354
The party is over, Julien.
Your brilliant plan has failed.

963
01:02:54,428 --> 01:02:56,190
What are you talking about?

964
01:02:56,262 --> 01:02:57,957
Your friend here is what we call

965
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:01,193
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

966
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:03,201
And he eats steak...

967
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:04,736
...which is you.

968
01:03:04,804 --> 01:03:09,002
- Get out of here.
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

969
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:10,906
The plan failed.

970
01:03:10,977 --> 01:03:14,242
All is lost! We're all doomed.

971
01:03:14,313 --> 01:03:19,113
The fossas will come back and
gobble us with their mouths because...

972
01:03:19,184 --> 01:03:21,550
...we are all steak.

973
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:23,485
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

974
01:03:23,555 --> 01:03:25,785
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.

975
01:03:25,857 --> 01:03:30,191
He belongs with his own kind
on the fossa side of the island.

976
01:03:30,262 --> 01:03:32,162
By the power vested in me,

977
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:35,529
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

978
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,760
Be gone!

979
01:03:36,835 --> 01:03:39,668
What? Come on, do I look
like a steak to you?

980
01:03:39,738 --> 01:03:40,966
Yeah!

981
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,939
See, I told you I don't
look like a... Wait. What you say?

982
01:03:44,008 --> 01:03:46,408
Oh, yeah!

983
01:03:47,912 --> 01:03:51,507
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives.

984
01:03:53,517 --> 01:03:55,178
Marty, run!

985
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:15,704
A bull's eye.
Excellent shot, Maurice.

986
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:16,864
Thank you.

987
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:23,507
Marty?

988
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:27,849
I'm so sorry, Marty.

989
01:04:32,354 --> 01:04:35,118
What is wrong with me?

990
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,522
Ow.

991
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:39,390
Oh, no.

992
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:41,122
What have I done?

993
01:04:41,196 --> 01:04:44,290
It's true. I'm a monster.

994
01:04:44,366 --> 01:04:46,334
I got to get out of here.

995
01:06:57,927 --> 01:07:01,294
What have I done?
This is a nightmare.

996
01:07:01,364 --> 01:07:03,093
And it's all my fault.

997
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:06,134
Now, because of me,
we've lost Alex.

998
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:07,863
Well, what are we going to do?

999
01:07:07,937 --> 01:07:10,599
We'll find a way to help him.
That's what we'll do.

1000
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:11,662
Okay.

1001
01:07:11,741 --> 01:07:14,470
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?

1002
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:16,806
We're tough.
We're gritty.

1003
01:07:16,878 --> 01:07:18,607
We're adaptable!

1004
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,615
And we are not going
to lay down like a bunch of Melmans.

1005
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:24,151
No, we're not.

1006
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:25,481
Oh. Gloria.

1007
01:07:25,553 --> 01:07:28,681
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat.

1008
01:07:28,823 --> 01:07:30,950
- The boat!
- The boat?

1009
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:35,018
The boat's come back for us!
Come on, guys, we got to flag it down.

1010
01:07:37,164 --> 01:07:38,153
There it is!

1011
01:07:38,232 --> 01:07:40,166
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

1012
01:07:40,234 --> 01:07:41,701
Over here! Yo!

1013
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:44,465
Melman, give me a lift.
Hurry up! Lift me up!

1014
01:07:44,538 --> 01:07:45,937
Help! Help! Help!

1015
01:07:46,006 --> 01:07:48,839
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.
- Over here!

1016
01:07:48,909 --> 01:07:52,640
- Melman! Steady. This way!
- You have no idea how much this hurts.

1017
01:07:52,713 --> 01:07:54,578
Hey, boat! We're over here!

1018
01:07:56,817 --> 01:08:00,912
Look! It's turning! It's coming back!
It's coming back!

1019
01:08:00,987 --> 01:08:03,285
Come on! Come on, baby!

1020
01:08:04,424 --> 01:08:06,119
Yes! You guys.

1021
01:08:06,192 --> 01:08:08,490
You flag down that boat.
I'll get Alex.

1022
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:11,394
Whoa! Hold on there.

1023
01:08:11,464 --> 01:08:13,864
You cannot go back there by yourself.

1024
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:16,265
Aw, come on. I know Alex.

1025
01:08:16,335 --> 01:08:19,099
He hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it.

1026
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:21,606
The people are coming.
They can help us.

1027
01:08:21,674 --> 01:08:24,665
Melman's right. The people
will know what to do.

1028
01:08:24,743 --> 01:08:26,973
Now, we got to flag down that boat.

1029
01:08:45,363 --> 01:08:48,024
Now, this is more like it.

1030
01:08:48,098 --> 01:08:51,465
You?! Oh, ma...
Where are the people?

1031
01:08:51,535 --> 01:08:53,469
We killed them and ate their livers.

1032
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:56,836
Got you, didn't I?

1033
01:08:56,907 --> 01:08:59,535
Just kidding, doll,
the people are fine.

1034
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:02,941
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.

1035
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,379
Hey, I know you two.

1036
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:09,885
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

1037
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:13,912
Marty? He's righ... Where did
he go? He was right behind us.

1038
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:17,551
He went back for Alex.
He's going to get himself killed!

1039
01:09:17,627 --> 01:09:20,790
Well, boys, our
monochromatic friend's in danger.

1040
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:22,764
Looks like we have a job to do.

1041
01:09:22,832 --> 01:09:25,699
Captain's log: Embarking
into hostile environment.

1042
01:09:25,768 --> 01:09:29,295
Kowalski. We'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.

1043
01:09:29,472 --> 01:09:31,940
Rico. We'll need
special tactical equipment.

1044
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:34,601
We're going to face extreme peril.

1045
01:09:34,676 --> 01:09:37,076
Private probably won't survive.

1046
01:09:43,886 --> 01:09:46,753
Alex! Come out, Alex!

1047
01:09:46,822 --> 01:09:49,120
The boat's here! We can go home!

1048
01:09:55,630 --> 01:10:00,727
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1049
01:10:00,902 --> 01:10:05,498
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1050
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:09,007
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1051
01:10:09,076 --> 01:10:12,807
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1052
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,279
Alex!

1053
01:10:16,284 --> 01:10:17,273
Alex!

1054
01:10:19,185 --> 01:10:20,652
Marty?

1055
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,486
Snap out of it, Alex. The boat
came back. We can get out of here.

1056
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:28,619
We can go back to civilization, and
everything will be like it used to be.

1057
01:10:28,695 --> 01:10:30,185
Stay back.

1058
01:10:31,197 --> 01:10:32,289
Please.

1059
01:10:33,433 --> 01:10:35,367
I'm a monster.

1060
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:38,802
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

1061
01:10:38,872 --> 01:10:41,966
We're a team.
You and me, remember?

1062
01:10:49,848 --> 01:10:51,975
I don't want to hurt you.

1063
01:11:23,348 --> 01:11:25,213
Alex.

1064
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:27,342
I ain't leaving without you.

1065
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:46,431
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

1066
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:50,496
It's a wonderful song.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

1067
01:11:51,842 --> 01:11:55,675
Start spreadin' the news

1068
01:11:56,812 --> 01:12:00,578
I'm leaving today

1069
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:05,280
We are a great big part of it

1070
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:11,983
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

1071
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,723
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

1072
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:17,993
You really don't want
to hear me sing this by myself.

1073
01:12:21,636 --> 01:12:25,299
Uh, Alex? Could you
come out here for a minute?

1074
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:28,809
Hey, Alex, a little help.

1075
01:12:29,744 --> 01:12:31,075
Help me!

1076
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:34,342
Alex! Help!

1077
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:42,549
Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody!

1078
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:45,690
Help!

1079
01:12:56,904 --> 01:12:58,496
- Melman?
- That's right, baby.

1080
01:13:00,074 --> 01:13:01,405
Run!

1081
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:05,701
- What's the plan?
- This is the plan.

1082
01:13:05,778 --> 01:13:07,370
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

1083
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:09,677
This is the plan?

1084
01:13:09,749 --> 01:13:11,046
Fossa halt.

1085
01:13:13,686 --> 01:13:16,120
Fossa ooh.

1086
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:18,789
Fossa aaahh.

1087
01:13:20,059 --> 01:13:22,459
Fossa ooh.

1088
01:13:23,996 --> 01:13:26,361
Fossa aaahh.

1089
01:13:27,232 --> 01:13:28,995
Come and get it.

1090
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:30,091
Fossa.

1091
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:44,715
- Take that.
- Fossa ow!

1092
01:13:44,783 --> 01:13:47,217
There's too many of them, skipper.

1093
01:13:47,285 --> 01:13:50,378
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

1094
01:13:56,127 --> 01:13:58,493
Alex?

1095
01:13:58,562 --> 01:13:59,995
That's my kill.

1096
01:14:00,064 --> 01:14:01,429
Mine.

1097
01:14:07,171 --> 01:14:08,832
Alex hungry.

1098
01:14:10,174 --> 01:14:11,698
Alex eat.

1099
01:14:28,591 --> 01:14:29,922
It's showtime.

1100
01:14:32,028 --> 01:14:33,757
Thanks for not giving up on me.

1101
01:14:34,798 --> 01:14:38,699
Man, you almost gave me a heart attack.
You can't just come sneak up on me.

1102
01:14:38,767 --> 01:14:41,793
Just because you're a lion...
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1103
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:45,271
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

1104
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,399
Like I said, it's showtime.

1105
01:14:48,877 --> 01:14:50,071
Mine.

1106
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:52,777
My kill.

1107
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:56,077
They're all mine.

1108
01:14:58,287 --> 01:15:00,220
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!

1109
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:02,279
- Don't eat me!
- He's big and scary!

1110
01:15:02,356 --> 01:15:05,757
Fear me! Savagery
beyond comprehension.

1111
01:15:05,827 --> 01:15:09,786
- I am far too young to die!
- You're a monster! A monster, I say!

1112
01:15:09,864 --> 01:15:12,355
- And, you!
- Me?

1113
01:15:16,437 --> 01:15:21,238
Oh, you want some of this? Ooh!
You better run for your lives.

1114
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,769
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

1115
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:34,582
This is my territory.
Understand?

1116
01:15:35,722 --> 01:15:39,783
I never, ever want
to see you on my turf again.

1117
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:47,487
Boo.

1118
01:15:50,402 --> 01:15:52,267
Yeah! You the cat!

1119
01:15:53,772 --> 01:15:55,171
Got my boy back!

1120
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:58,108
I did it!

1121
01:15:58,177 --> 01:16:02,204
Give me some love! The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

1122
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:05,614
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

1123
01:16:05,684 --> 01:16:07,845
I am very clever king.

1124
01:16:08,621 --> 01:16:10,212
I am super genius.

1125
01:16:10,288 --> 01:16:12,882
I am robot king of the monkey things.

1126
01:16:12,957 --> 01:16:16,484
- Compute, compute.
- So, what's for lunch?

1127
01:16:18,863 --> 01:16:20,797
- Close those eyes.
- Why do I have to?

1128
01:16:20,865 --> 01:16:22,332
- Do it.
- They're closed.

1129
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,265
- Tighter.
- Yes, sir.

1130
01:16:24,335 --> 01:16:26,064
- No peeking.
- They're closed.

1131
01:16:26,137 --> 01:16:27,900
Rico.

1132
01:16:31,776 --> 01:16:32,833
Hai.

1133
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:35,705
Open that hatch.

1134
01:16:36,647 --> 01:16:39,172
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

1135
01:16:39,983 --> 01:16:42,577
Chew like you mean it.
Savor it.

1136
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,183
- And?
- Well?

1137
01:16:45,255 --> 01:16:47,120
Pretty good, right?

1138
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:49,590
There's always Plan B.

1139
01:16:51,261 --> 01:16:53,195
This is better than steak.

1140
01:16:53,263 --> 01:16:55,026
I love it. I love it!

1141
01:16:55,098 --> 01:16:57,088
The kitty loves the fishy.

1142
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:02,235
Well, I propose a toast.

1143
01:17:02,305 --> 01:17:05,240
Now, he may be a pain
in the butt at times...

1144
01:17:05,308 --> 01:17:07,435
And trust me, I know.

1145
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:10,206
But this cat proved
to me without a doubt

1146
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:12,713
that his heart
is bigger than his stomach.

1147
01:17:12,782 --> 01:17:14,579
- To Alex.
- To Alex.

1148
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:23,448
Enough! Stop it!

1149
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,388
What do you think?
Should we head back to New York?

1150
01:17:28,463 --> 01:17:30,954
I don't know. I mean,
this is your dream.

1151
01:17:31,032 --> 01:17:33,023
You sure you want to leave?

1152
01:17:33,101 --> 01:17:35,069
I don't care where we are.

1153
01:17:35,136 --> 01:17:38,435
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

1154
01:17:38,506 --> 01:17:40,133
Well, in that case...

1155
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:43,370
Yo. Rico.
I'll take 300 orders to go.

1156
01:17:43,444 --> 01:17:44,775
Hai.

1157
01:17:44,845 --> 01:17:48,576
But before you leave,
I have an announcement to make.

1158
01:17:48,649 --> 01:17:51,618
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

1159
01:17:51,685 --> 01:17:56,247
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

1160
01:17:56,323 --> 01:17:58,655
I have decided to thank you

1161
01:17:58,726 --> 01:18:01,456
for bringing peace to our home.

1162
01:18:01,528 --> 01:18:03,189
And to make you feel good,

1163
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:06,095
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

1164
01:18:06,165 --> 01:18:08,998
No, I couldn't. Really,
I can't take your crown.

1165
01:18:09,068 --> 01:18:11,559
That's okay,
I've got a bigger crown.

1166
01:18:11,637 --> 01:18:12,934
It's got a gecko on it.

1167
01:18:13,006 --> 01:18:16,203
Look at him shake.
Go, Stevie, go!

1168
01:18:17,243 --> 01:18:17,310
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1169
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:20,074
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1170
01:18:20,146 --> 01:18:21,636
- So long!
- Bye-bye, now.

1171
01:18:21,714 --> 01:18:23,306
- Arrivederci.
- Bye-bye.

1172
01:18:23,383 --> 01:18:26,045
- Toodle-oo!
- See you later, crocodile.

1173
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:29,212
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

1174
01:18:30,055 --> 01:18:32,319
Faster, you naughty little monkey.

1175
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:35,758
By the time we get back to New York,
it'll be the middle of winter.

1176
01:18:35,827 --> 01:18:37,852
So I was just thinking, why rush?

1177
01:18:37,929 --> 01:18:40,864
Maybe we could make
a few side stops along the way.

1178
01:18:40,932 --> 01:18:43,332
- Maybe Paris.
- You just read my mind.

1179
01:18:43,402 --> 01:18:45,836
- I was thinking Spain.
- Run with the bulls.

1180
01:18:45,904 --> 01:18:48,668
- What about Fiji?
- Canada. Can we?

1181
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,605
Cheap meds.

1182
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:53,370
I wouldn't even mind
coming back here sometime.

1183
01:18:53,444 --> 01:18:55,776
- I could do that.
- You could say that again.

1184
01:18:55,846 --> 01:18:58,815
- Skipper?
- I always wanted to go to Australia.

1185
01:18:58,883 --> 01:19:02,478
Don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

1186
01:19:02,553 --> 01:19:03,679
Nah.

1187
