1
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,119
Straight through there and
to the left

2
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,772
Would you like to...

3
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:29,094
- Who's this?
- Pardon me?

4
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:32,192
That's not my father.

5
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,153
Shit, we've taken the wrong one.

6
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,125
We're really sorry for this.
We'll go back and get him.

7
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,366
Jesus...

8
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:18,444
They brought the wrong coffin.

9
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,996
You're joking.

10
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:24,740
Can you believe that?
Good thing I checked.

11
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:28,185
We could be running the service for
some random member of the public.

12
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,825
What kind of business are these people
running anyway?

13
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,354
My God.

14
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,122
There's just so much to worry about
you know. And Mom's in such a state...

15
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,514
Robert is clear he'll not do anything to
help, assuming he gets here at all.

16
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:39,370
Even the funeral speech is awful.

17
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,806
I'm sure it's not that awful.

18
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,996
Yeah, it is.

19
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,882
I was thinking that maybe Robert...

20
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:46,449
...should write the speech.
He's such a good writer.

21
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:47,569
Maybe we should
let him do it.

22
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:50,782
You're every bit as good a writer as
your brother Daniel, if not better,...

23
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:53,926
...you just have to let somebody
else read your novel.

24
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,512
Everything is gonna be okay.

25
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,461
When the funeral is over...

26
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,881
...we just have to focus on
moving out of here...

27
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,353
...and starting our own
lives properly.

28
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,907
You called them?

29
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:10,807
Didn't you, Daniel?

30
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,857
You did put the deposit
on the flat?

31
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:15,354
I'll sort it out.
I promise.

32
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,834
God, I hate funerals.
Don't you?

33
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:24,331
They're just so depressing.

34
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:26,179
It's just the death and
everything...

35
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:27,882
...know what I mean?
Do you agree, Justin?

36
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,718
Justin?

37
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,907
Yeah, it's alright

38
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:36,269
Alright? How can you possibly think
of that as alright?

39
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:39,429
Why are you even coming to this?
You don't even know Daniel.

40
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,479
I do know Daniel.
I met him a couple of times.

41
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,564
A couple of times. Well he's not
a friend, is he?

42
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:45,231
No, not a friend.

43
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:48,252
If you're gonna smoke will you please
put that out the window?

44
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:51,587
I'd rather not get your cancer
thank you very much.

45
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:54,331
I got my own problems to be
worrying about.

46
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:55,895
Yeah, like what?

47
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,651
The discoloration on my wrist
I keep telling you about.

48
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:01,001
Look at it.

49
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:02,530
It's fucked.

50
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,719
I'm fucked.

51
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:09,494
Why are we even coming, eh?

52
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:12,738
Cause of Martha, isn't it?

53
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,154
Justin...

54
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,593
Are you okay?

55
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:23,090
Not too bad, thanks Martha.

56
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:25,318
I'm a bit nervous.

57
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:26,741
About seeing my Dad?

58
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,597
I just don't think I've been so
openly hated by anyone before.

59
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,827
He just hates everyone.
You mustn't take it to heart.

60
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,807
You need to relax with him.

61
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:38,203
I can't help it.
He puts me on edge.

62
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,338
He'll be more concerned his sister
husband just died.

63
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,198
He's not gonna be focused
on you.

64
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:46,227
Anyway, I'm sure when I tell him
that we're getting married...

65
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,104
...He'll start to learn
to accept you.

66
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,410
Are you sure about that?

67
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:50,533
Of course.

68
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,802
I can't really see Victor
as the accepting type.

69
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,891
We're on our way to
a funeral you wanker!

70
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:03,424
Haven't you got any respect?

71
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:05,612
Okay, calm down.

72
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:07,521
It's all right, breathe.

73
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,718
Through your nose.
Okay?

74
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,925
Deep breaths.

75
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,478
You alright?

76
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:14,667
That fucking...

77
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:25,454
Alright, I'm gonna go down.

78
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:27,321
Hope they brought the right
coffin this time.

79
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:28,363
I'll come with you.

80
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,406
It's okay, I can do it.

81
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,236
I know, I know you can.

82
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,036
I'm just gonna check on
the seats.

83
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:34,200
To make sure there's enough room
for Uncle Alfie.

84
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,390
Shit.

85
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:40,382
Hello?

86
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,091
Hey mate. How are you?
You alright?

87
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:44,620
Yeah.

88
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,561
Of course I remember
Uncle Alfie.

89
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:51,219
Absolutely fine.
Yeah, not a problem at all.

90
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:54,309
No. Of course I don't mind.

91
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:57,107
Alright. Yeah, don't worry.

92
00:08:57,212 --> 00:08:58,584
It's fine.
I promise.

93
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,774
See you soon.
Okay, bye.

94
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:03,066
Shit.

95
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:20,480
Is this... your father sir?

96
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,652
Yes, it is yes.

97
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:41,449
Hey mum.
You alright?

98
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:44,352
I just don't know what I'm
going to do without him.

99
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,068
What do I have to live for now?

100
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:48,743
Don't be silly.
You got your friends, family...

101
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:50,827
You got me and Jane
and Robert...

102
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,183
Where is Robert?
Have you heard from him?

103
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:53,508
His plane will land at 10:00

104
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:54,892
But he'll be here.
Don't worry.

105
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,705
If there's anything I can do Sandra...

106
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,118
Don't put your hand there dear...

107
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:01,307
...you'll leave marks.

108
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,648
I'll get'em to you
this evening.

109
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:23,690
No, can't do it this afternoon.
I got a funeral.

110
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,055
Yeah, my uncle died.

111
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,759
Yeah, tragic.

112
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,287
I'm telling you mate.
This is really powerful stuff.

113
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:31,886
You really only need to take half.

114
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,741
Trust me. You're gonna
bite your fucking head off.

115
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,665
I gotta go.
My sister's in.

116
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,257
I'll tell you if I get to the bar
after the funeral.

117
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:42,447
Bye.

118
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,106
Hang on!

119
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,400
Hi. How's it going?

120
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:06,414
Troy you're not ready?
Come on, we're gonna be late.

121
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:08,343
I put on my trousers and
I'm done.

122
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:09,429
Are you guys okay?

123
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:10,514
Simon is a bit freaked out.

124
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:13,033
Some asshole almost drove us
off the road.

125
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:17,113
Fucking bastards. Make yourselves comfy.
I'll be out in two minutes.

126
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,093
Look at these pills all
over the place.

127
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:21,593
Troy is studying to be
a pharmacist.

128
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,191
Are you okay?

129
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:24,843
I'm a bit shaky...

130
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:27,339
Not much, just a little...

131
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,988
Take one of these.

132
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,758
It will calm you down.

133
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,148
You sure?

134
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:38,337
Absolutely.
It's just Valium.

135
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,212
I used to take them all the time.

136
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,783
It will make you feel better.
Honestly.

137
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,972
Come on. Open wide.

138
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:54,977
I'm ready.

139
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:08,836
Hello?

140
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,586
Hello?

141
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,393
Robert?

142
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,478
Robert.

143
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:17,366
Hi, Mom.

144
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,406
Darling.

145
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,595
Happy to see you.

146
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,326
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

147
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,504
Hi Robert.

148
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,274
How are you?

149
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:32,213
Good.

150
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:33,044
How was your flight?

151
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:35,964
Great... There was a lot of turbulence
that was a bit worrying...

152
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,336
That's the thing about 1st class.
It doesn't matter how much you pay...

153
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:38,977
for the ticket...

154
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:43,601
...if the plane crushes we're
all gonna end up dead.

155
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,796
Sorry.

156
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,358
No, no, I'll go.

157
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:49,547
Don't worry.

158
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,619
Shit.

159
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:08,439
That's him.

160
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:14,482
Jesus, Howard. You didn't say he was
gonna be in a fucking wheelchair.

161
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,251
Uncle Alfie, hello.

162
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:28,868
We're here to take you
to the funeral.

163
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:32,606
Where the fuck have you been?
You're late.

164
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:59,574
This is bloody grim, isn't it?

165
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,929
It's not supposed to be fun.

166
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:03,118
I know, but Jesus...

167
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:08,579
I feel like my heart has been wrenched
out of my ribcage.

168
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:09,391
It's awful.

169
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,081
Well, that's grief for you.

170
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:13,149
That's why I don't like
close relationships.

171
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,511
Too much emotion.

172
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:21,771
I'm just glad you're
gonna be here with Mom.

173
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,965
Yeah, well not for long.

174
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:26,335
Jane and I are moving out.

175
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:27,920
What about Mom?

176
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:31,011
Actually I was thinking
maybe she'd like to...

177
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:34,103
...to come with you to New York
for a bit.

178
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,969
Don't be ridiculous.
I can't take her to New York.

179
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:38,226
What am I gonna do with her?
Take her to parties?

180
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:39,300
We've already decided.

181
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:40,910
We're putting a deposit
in a flat.

182
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,018
- I'm gonna need money.
- What money?

183
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:45,531
Money for all this.
For the funeral.

184
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,129
You agreed to pay the half.

185
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:49,318
- Did I?
- Yeah.

186
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,584
Yeah, so...

187
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:55,362
Yeah, I don't have it on me Daniel.

188
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:57,758
I can get it to you in a few... months.

189
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:00,165
A few months?
Robert, I need it now.

190
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,890
Can't happen.
I'm skinned.

191
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:04,048
What do you mean skinned?

192
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,540
You're a successful novelist
you live in New York...

193
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:08,237
...and you have a penthouse there.
What do you mean?

194
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,788
Do you have any idea how
much it costs for up-keeping it?

195
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:13,934
And besides this, I paid a fortune
to fly out here.

196
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,863
Do you know how much they charge for
1st class nowadays?

197
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,877
It's a fucking disgrace.

198
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,400
So, poor old Uncle Eddie, eh?

199
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:25,874
Yes.

200
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:28,924
Did you ever meet Uncle Eddie, Simon?

201
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,000
Simon?

202
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:33,329
Was there a dog in here
just now?

203
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,518
What?

204
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:38,748
I'm sure there was a dog in here.

205
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:42,042
What the hell are you talking about?

206
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,293
There's nowhere to park.

207
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:04,392
This is ridiculous.

208
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,525
How about over there?

209
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,714
The guy is coming out.

210
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,656
Take it!

211
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,219
Alright!

212
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:12,408
What are you doing?

213
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:15,255
Are you mental?

214
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:20,204
Sorry.

215
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:21,854
Excuse me.

216
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,222
Sorry...
Oh, hi Martha.

217
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:25,476
I was just about to park there
actually.

218
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,595
Are you a relative, Howard?

219
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,010
No, I'm not.
But...

220
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,199
Hey Martha.

221
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,772
Who's that?

222
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:42,801
What's happening?

223
00:16:42,906 --> 00:16:44,121
Did you see that?
She barely even looked at me.

224
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:45,927
I said what's happening?
Are we there?

225
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:48,175
Oh, my God. We got
Uncle Alfie in the car.

226
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,562
I can't believe I forgot to say
I've got Uncle Alfie in the car.

227
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,009
Alright, keep your hair on!

228
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:57,252
What the hell is going on?

229
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:59,441
She barely even looked.

230
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:11,215
Very green here. Isn't it...?

231
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,716
Very green...

232
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,634
Simon, what the hell is
the matter with you?

233
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,510
What do you mean?

234
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:21,532
You're talking about phantom dogs
and things being green...

235
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,408
What's going on?

236
00:17:23,513 --> 00:17:25,598
I don't know...

237
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,085
Martha.

238
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,657
Is Simon normally like this?

239
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:41,047
Of course he's not normally
like this.

240
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:43,237
Something's not right.

241
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,050
Hello...

242
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,994
I think it must be the Valium.

243
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:56,929
The Valium?

244
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,354
Yes.

245
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,645
I gave him a Valium
from your flat.

246
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,763
I think he's just not
used to it...

247
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,448
Right.

248
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:11,691
Are you gonna get any closer?

249
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:13,984
You're going the wrong way.

250
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:15,993
Stop the car. I need to
speak to Martha.

251
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:17,025
What?

252
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,433
I need to speak to Martha.

253
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,101
What about Alfie?
I need help with Uncle Alfie.

254
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:23,710
We're gonna be late!

255
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,942
Please, stop doing that.

256
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,807
Thank you for coming.
So good to see you.

257
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:40,349
It's so weird to be back here.
I feel so out of it.

258
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,128
That's because you live in a different
country. You loose touch.

259
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:48,107
Who are all these people?
I don't recognise any of them.

260
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,296
Who's that guy?

261
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:53,653
I've no idea. Probably some friend
from dad's work.

262
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,953
Are you telling me I have to pay for
this entire funeral on my own?

263
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:59,069
Well, I can't draw money out of
thin air, Daniel.

264
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:01,258
Jesus fucking Christ!

265
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:03,787
Daniel.
How's everything going?

266
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:05,495
Fine, thanks Reverend Davis.

267
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,381
We're just waiting for everyone to
arrive and then we can start.

268
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:09,570
Great, thank you.

269
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:11,646
Have you met my brother Robert?

270
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,817
The writer of course.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

271
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,675
I have read several of
your novels.

272
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,691
Really?

273
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:19,983
You must be very
proud of your brother.

274
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:21,233
Yeah, very proud.

275
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:23,317
Will you be reading the
eulogy today?

276
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,903
No, Daniel is
going to do it.

277
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:28,841
Great.

278
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:32,845
I'll just make sure I have
everything I need.

279
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:38,265
Listen, I think you
should do the eulogy.

280
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:40,692
...everyone's expecting you to do it,
I'll just make a mess of it anyways.

281
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:43,012
Don't be silly.
You do it.

282
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:45,307
You'll be fine.

283
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,691
All these can go
through now.

284
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:49,530
How's my little sister?

285
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,072
That's very sad.

286
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:53,192
He was a wonderful husband
wasn't he?

287
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:55,382
So tender, so devoted.

288
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:57,534
Can I get you a cop of
tea, Sandra?

289
00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:59,445
Tea can do many things, Jane.

290
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,385
But it can't bring back
the dead.

291
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:10,555
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

292
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,750
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

293
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:15,057
Daniel, have you called yet
about the deposit?

294
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:16,070
No, I haven't.

295
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,008
Why don't you give me the number
and I can do it?

296
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:19,291
Jane, don't make a fuss.

297
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:21,293
Do you see that guy standing by
the table?

298
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:23,273
Do you recognise him at all?

299
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:24,660
He's really staring at me.

300
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,422
Are you listening to me at all?

301
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,900
We have to put the deposit on the
flat, before it's too late.

302
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:29,669
I know.

303
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:31,859
Alright?

304
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,831
You'll break it!

305
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:50,268
Hurry up, we're late.

306
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:53,394
Oh God...

307
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,143
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

308
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,461
..."My father was an
exceptional man"...

309
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,147
Kate has grown up a bit
isn't she?

310
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:01,830
What?

311
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:02,872
Katey.

312
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:06,260
She was a little girl
when I left and now...

313
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:07,526
...she's fit.

314
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,438
I'm going to chat with her.

315
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,627
Yeah, why don't you?

316
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,003
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

317
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,775
Hello there.

318
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,964
Oh, hello.

319
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:24,488
I was really sorry to hear
about your father.

320
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,980
He always talked about you.

321
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,820
Said you were a good son.

322
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:31,010
Thank you.

323
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:33,510
Did he ever mention me?

324
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:34,969
I'm Peter.

325
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:39,681
Peter... I don't think so.
Were you friends with Dad?

326
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:43,879
Nice to meet you and
thank you for coming.

327
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:56,357
Push the bloody thing...

328
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:57,258
I am damn it...

329
00:21:57,362 --> 00:21:59,448
You're useless...

330
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:02,307
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

331
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:03,175
Daniel.

332
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,298
I think we should be calling
everyone in, now...

333
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:06,299
...to start the service.

334
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:07,027
Sure.

335
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:09,896
Really I'm only supposed to be
here until 3.

336
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,203
Sure. Do you mind if we wait
5 minutes for my Uncle Alfie?

337
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:13,785
We shouldn't start without
him, if possible.

338
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,975
Sure.

339
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,006
Look.

340
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,196
Isn't it beautiful?

341
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,567
Martha. Can I have a word?

342
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:37,842
Excuse me.

343
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:39,630
Why?
What is it?

344
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,191
I have to tell you something.

345
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:45,137
I'm warning you in advance
you're not gonna like it.

346
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:46,865
Nice to see you.
Thank you for coming.

347
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,486
Daniel.

348
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,529
Uncle Victor.

349
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,243
Hello, Robert.

350
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:51,980
Uncle Victor.
How are you?

351
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:54,057
I'm...

352
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,330
...sad.

353
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:56,114
I understand.

354
00:22:56,218 --> 00:22:57,757
So, how are things in
New York?

355
00:22:57,861 --> 00:22:59,378
Great. Really good.

356
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:02,990
What's with this nonsense about you
not doing the eulogy?

357
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,954
That's right. Daniel is gonna
do the eulogy.

358
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:06,743
Well that's a dams shame.

359
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,243
I mean, I'm sure Daniel will
be fine but...

360
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:13,116
...after all you're the
writer in the family.

361
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,145
Will you just excuse me a second?

362
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,437
So...

363
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,152
...any new books coming out?

364
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:20,144
I'll get my things together.

365
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:21,366
Sure.

366
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:23,104
You alright?

367
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:26,473
Every single bloody person
wants Robert to do the eulogy.

368
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:28,194
He's my father too,
isn't he?

369
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:30,018
I'm entitled to the
bloody eulogy.

370
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,207
Of course.

371
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,998
And it's gonna be the best bloody
eulogy anybody has ever heard.

372
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:36,812
Alright?

373
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,768
Looks like Robert won't
be doing the eulogy.

374
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:44,905
What did you just say?

375
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:49,399
I said the Valium you gave Simon
wasn't actually a Valium.

376
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:52,575
It's a hallucinogenic concoction.

377
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:56,519
You know, stuff lice acid, mescaline,
a little smaller though.

378
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:57,632
This isn't funny Troy.

379
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,572
I'm not being funny.
Look at him.

380
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,877
You're absolutely stupid.

381
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,052
How can you leave stuff like
that, on your flat?

382
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:09,619
I didn't think that
someone will take it.

383
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:12,009
Who goes to someone else's flat
and take anything?

384
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:14,199
It was a Valium bottle.

385
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,701
Fuck, Troy.

386
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:18,577
What am I to do?

387
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:19,577
Should I tell him?

388
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:20,922
No! Don't do that.

389
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,990
You'll freak him out completely.

390
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,117
We should keep a
very close eye on him.

391
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,756
Make sure he doesn't get
out of control.

392
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,361
And don't let him spend too long
talking to one person.

393
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:33,551
Damn.

394
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,300
Hey Dad.
How are you doing?

395
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,133
You're late.

396
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:51,808
Hi Dad.

397
00:24:51,912 --> 00:24:52,882
Hi Troy.

398
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:54,460
You're missing University
today?

399
00:24:54,564 --> 00:24:56,023
Nothing to worry.
I'll catch up.

400
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,524
I know.
I'm not worried about you.

401
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:00,608
I see you brought
your friend along.

402
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,791
His name is Simon.
Simon?

403
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:05,437
Of course I brought him,
he's my boyfriend.

404
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,934
Martha, so good to see you.

405
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,446
I'm so sorry Aunt Sandra.
We'll miss Uncle Edward terribly.

406
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,217
Yeah, he was a great guy.

407
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:15,122
Yes he was.

408
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:16,236
Simon, this is my...

409
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,150
Yeah absolutely...

410
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,952
So sorry about the death.

411
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,020
So sorry...

412
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,471
Thank you.

413
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,660
...everything.

414
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:46,078
What are you gonna do?

415
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:47,476
No idea.

416
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,421
I can't leave. Aunt Sandra will
never speak to me again.

417
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:52,611
Shit.

418
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,257
Hey Martha.

419
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:15,045
You look nice.

420
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:16,297
I'm dressed for a funeral.

421
00:26:16,402 --> 00:26:18,453
Yeah, but still...

422
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:22,378
I heard about the engagement.
What's that about?

423
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:24,948
Who told you that?
I haven't even told my dad.

424
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:27,240
Is that the guy you're
gonna marry?

425
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:30,714
You're gonna spend the rest of
your life with him?

426
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:32,904
Yup, that's him.

427
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:39,222
Simon?

428
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,411
Martha...

429
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,675
Come on!

430
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:50,325
Can you give me a hand, Justin?

431
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,881
Hi... Daniel.

432
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,239
There's something I'd like to talk to
you about when you have a moment.

433
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,046
Great, do you mind
if we do it later?

434
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,924
Because my Uncle Alfie
just came in.

435
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:05,113
Sure.

436
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:12,898
Thank you Justin.
Thank so much mate.

437
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:14,518
I hope it wasn't too
much hustle.

438
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:15,837
How are you Uncle Alfie?

439
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:18,027
Terrible.

440
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,615
Ladies and Gentlemen.

441
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,663
If you could all
kindly take your seats...

442
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:38,692
We're about to begin the service.

443
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:45,121
Simon, please.

444
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:46,482
Move.

445
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:47,656
Don't start yet.

446
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,845
Don't start. Move.

447
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,849
Jesus, Howard.
You stink.

448
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,052
Family and friends.

449
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,196
Maybe, because you left me to
deal with Uncle Alfie on my own...

450
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,681
...not to mention you
taking all the credit.

451
00:28:49,786 --> 00:28:51,432
Can you please be quiet?

452
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:54,526
We'll start with a favorite
passage of Edward's...

453
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,613
...from the King James' bible...

454
00:28:56,717 --> 00:29:00,542
...it's the 1st book of Samuel
chapter 18.

455
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:04,299
Martha, just so you know,

456
00:29:04,403 --> 00:29:07,448
we had Uncle Alfie in the
car with us.

457
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:09,430
And you took my parking space.

458
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:12,212
And I had to push him half a mile
up the hill by myself.

459
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,871
Almost fainted.

460
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:15,643
That was MY parking space.

461
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:17,253
If you don't stop this...

462
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:19,568
...I'll take you out and kick
the living shit out of you.

463
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:20,454
Do you understand?

464
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,642
What's going on?

465
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:22,749
She stole my
parking space.

466
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:23,986
What do you mean she stole
your parking space?

467
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:27,015
This is a funeral.
Behave yourself.

468
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,019
Then, Jonathan and David made
a covenant.

469
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:37,013
Because he loved him
as his own soul.

470
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,224
And so it came to pass
that the soul of Jonathan...

471
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:44,094
...was knit with
the soul of David.

472
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,606
And Jonathan stripped himself
of the robe that was upon him...

473
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,837
...and gave it to David.

474
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,428
And his garments,
even his sword...

475
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:56,933
...and his bow...

476
00:29:57,426 --> 00:29:59,591
...and his belt.

477
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:08,173
Now, we'll have a few words from
Edward's son, Daniel.

478
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,248
Hi, everyone.

479
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:27,188
Thanks for so many of
you coming.

480
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:31,206
I never realised Dad was
so popular.

481
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,429
In fact, it seems he has more
friends now...

482
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:37,167
...that he's dead, than
when he was alive.

483
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:53,238
My father was an exceptional man.

484
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:56,865
He was born in 1938
just a year before the war.

485
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:59,752
I'll never forget the time when
Dad took us...

486
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:01,393
...to the place where
he grew up.

487
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:04,688
Near a town called Crowley
at Sassex.

488
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:07,226
It's changed a lot
over the years...

489
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,621
...with the expansion
of Gatwick airport.

490
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:12,529
Actually, it's something of
a commuter town now...

491
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:16,622
...partly because of it's
proximity to London.

492
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:20,696
When my father was young it
had pastures.

493
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:24,519
And fields and greenery.

494
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:27,481
An Dad would run around
the countryside for hours...

495
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,505
...with his close boyhood friend, Bob.

496
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:34,952
He told how they spend summer days
riding bikes...

497
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,229
Did you see that?

498
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:40,078
The coffin just moved.

499
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:41,251
...and swimming in the lake.

500
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:43,440
Dad's...

501
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:51,506
Dad's first work, was working
after school...

502
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:53,696
...as an apprentice...

503
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:55,561
...for an electrician
named Mr. Thompson.

504
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,751
It happened again!

505
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:00,954
I'm telling you, the
coffin is moving!

506
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:03,415
Simon, please calm down.

507
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:08,239
The coffin is moving, I tell you!

508
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:10,993
There's someone alive in there!

509
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,179
Simon, where are you going?

510
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:15,835
What the hell is wrong with you all?

511
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:18,025
Look at it!

512
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,003
Can't you see?

513
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,005
Open your eyes!

514
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:25,119
It's moving around in there.

515
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:26,268
Can't you see?

516
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:27,957
Simon, please.

517
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:28,979
What are you doing there?

518
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,339
Stop it!

519
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:31,653
Don't touch that!

520
00:32:31,757 --> 00:32:33,884
I've got to let him out!

521
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:38,369
God!

522
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:59,746
Calm down Mom.

523
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,652
Unbelievable, wasn't it?

524
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:11,827
If you like you can have some
tea and cake...

525
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:15,388
...and we'll call you as
soon as we can.

526
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:18,877
What the fuck was all
that about?

527
00:33:18,982 --> 00:33:20,913
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

528
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:22,201
The coffin was moving...

529
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:24,511
Just go back inside
and I'll explain it.

530
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:25,994
I'm so sorry.

531
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:28,471
I'm sure I heard scratching noise...

532
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:30,661
Please...

533
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:32,102
Are you alright?

534
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:33,144
No.

535
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:37,591
And I haven't made the call
about the deposit yet.

536
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:40,230
Kill him.

537
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:42,420
I'm going to kill him.

538
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:43,773
Dad, leave it.

539
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:44,607
Leave it?!

540
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:45,892
He wrecked the funeral.

541
00:33:45,996 --> 00:33:46,899
It wasn't his fault.

542
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:48,444
What do you mean it
wasn't his fault?

543
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:50,790
Your Aunt Sandra is in tatters.

544
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:53,938
I want him out of hear, this moment.
Is that clear?

545
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:56,884
Tell me you will have nothing
to do with that...

546
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:58,562
...ridiculous man, ever again.

547
00:33:58,666 --> 00:33:59,444
I'm sorry.

548
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:01,633
No, I can't do that.

549
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:04,569
Why not?

550
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:07,463
Because we're moving in together.

551
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,201
God.

552
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:12,193
Have you completely
lost your senses?

553
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:16,158
He's not actually like this.
He took some drugs and...

554
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,191
...and made him act like this.

555
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:19,381
Drugs? What drugs?

556
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:28,847
He took some Valium and had
a bad reaction.

557
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,023
Valium?

558
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:35,213
Yes.

559
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:39,932
That's it.

560
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:42,910
We'll talk about this later.

561
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:51,310
Simon?

562
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:52,358
Martha...

563
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:54,207
Okay...
Come and sit down.

564
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:56,859
Alright Janet.
I appreciate that.

565
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:59,048
Are you alright mate?

566
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,369
That was awful, wasn't it?

567
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,623
He fell in front of your mom like
a dead trout...

568
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,224
Howard, please...

569
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:08,100
Yeah sorry. It's just...

570
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,511
...you never know when it's
gonna happen to you.

571
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,738
Like me.
I've got this...

572
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:15,024
...weird patch of skin

573
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:16,481
I've had that a
couple of weeks...

574
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:17,933
...with no idea what it is...

575
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:20,271
Why not show it to my Uncle Victor?
He's a doctor.

576
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,461
Good idea.

577
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,137
I swear I saw it moving.

578
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:32,052
I swear I saw it moving.
No one else saw it?

579
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:35,421
I swear I saw it moving.
I must be going mad.

580
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:37,430
My hands are so big!

581
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,877
Simon. listen to me.
I need to tell you something.

582
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:46,459
You know I gave you some
Valium earlier?

583
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:47,852
Yes.

584
00:35:47,956 --> 00:35:50,042
Well...

585
00:35:50,536 --> 00:35:53,008
...it turns out...

586
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,698
...it wasn't actually Valium
at all.

587
00:36:00,252 --> 00:36:01,851
Can you hear me?

588
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:03,426
Hello?

589
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:04,659
You think we can start now?

590
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:05,400
I believe yes.

591
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,590
How do you feel, Sandra?

592
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,090
Hello doctor.

593
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:14,037
I've had this skin discoloration for
a couple of weeks now...

594
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:16,990
It's not going anywhere.
I know it's just a small patch...

595
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:19,149
...but it's weird.
It does look weird, doesn't it?

596
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:21,535
Victor, I'm going
back now.

597
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,318
You should probably go see
a dermatologist.

598
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:25,193
What do you think it is?

599
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:27,677
It looks like some kind
of pigment mutation.

600
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:28,841
Pigment mutation?

601
00:36:28,945 --> 00:36:31,025
Probably some allergic
reaction to...

602
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:32,830
...shellfish, nuts.

603
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:34,421
What kind of nuts?

604
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,159
Don't know. Peanuts, almonds...
Excuse me.

605
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,786
Do you see now?

606
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:47,705
Yes?

607
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:52,333
It's hallucinogenic

608
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,671
My advice is to relax...

609
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,742
...and just go with the flow.

610
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,507
Try and enjoy it.

611
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:05,697
You!

612
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,503
Simon!

613
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:09,169
How long does it last?

614
00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:10,003
I don't know.

615
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:10,941
Simon!

616
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:12,713
Around 8 hours?

617
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,415
8 hours of this?

618
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,562
Simon let go.

619
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,752
You!

620
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,066
Simon?

621
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:21,918
Let me go.
I'm going to be sick.

622
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:26,285
Simon, get back.

623
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:28,474
Simon.

624
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:31,970
A word with you Martha...

625
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:35,137
I'm sorry, excuse me...

626
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:38,821
Oh God, he's gonna be sick!

627
00:37:46,773 --> 00:37:48,859
Is it okay in there?

628
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:54,331
Simon are you okay?

629
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:57,158
Simon.

630
00:37:57,263 --> 00:37:59,330
Simon, let me in.

631
00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:02,698
Simon.

632
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:04,311
Martha?

633
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,630
Did you happen to see
a pill bottle?

634
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:07,484
Shit

635
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:08,610
Simon?

636
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:09,923
Right!

637
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:11,488
Keep it together!

638
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:12,709
Keep it together...

639
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:14,878
You can do this.

640
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:17,045
You're Simon Smith.

641
00:38:17,887 --> 00:38:19,972
You're a solicitor.

642
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:24,260
8 hours...

643
00:38:24,364 --> 00:38:25,884
No problem.

644
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:28,074
8 hours is at...

645
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,485
Where's my watch?

646
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,066
It's already been...

647
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:37,258
Simon, open the door.

648
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:41,491
7 hours to go.
God, Jesus!

649
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:43,275
Fuck!

650
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:44,578
Fuck.

651
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:46,672
It's nothing to worry about.

652
00:38:46,776 --> 00:38:48,811
Jesus!
Fuck!

653
00:38:48,915 --> 00:38:51,190
Grief does strange things to
people doesn't it?

654
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:53,217
Yeah.

655
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:55,290
If you remember, I have something
to talk to you about.

656
00:38:55,394 --> 00:38:57,074
Oh yes, yes.

657
00:38:57,178 --> 00:38:58,774
Is there some place quiet
we can go?

658
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,964
Sure.

659
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:28,418
Are you writing a book?

660
00:39:28,522 --> 00:39:29,467
Yes.

661
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:29,851
Like your brother.

662
00:39:29,956 --> 00:39:31,311
Well yes, but I write different.

663
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:32,596
He's a great writer
isn't he?

664
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,052
Yes, he is.

665
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:35,488
Anyway...

666
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:37,654
Yes, actually...

667
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:39,977
...I have some photos
I wanted to show you.

668
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:41,555
Okay.

669
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,745
- May I?
- Sure

670
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:48,404
We became quite close
your father and I...

671
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:49,791
...the last few months.

672
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:52,125
Ended up spending quite a
lot of time together.

673
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:53,324
Right.

674
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:56,403
Here's me and your father
at Ridgens Park.

675
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:57,468
Ah, yes

676
00:39:57,572 --> 00:40:01,011
And here we are on top of
those London buses

677
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:03,200
Terrible picture of me.

678
00:40:03,457 --> 00:40:05,831
Where did you and my dad meet?

679
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:08,021
Just around.

680
00:40:12,474 --> 00:40:14,559
Simon.

681
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,581
Are you alright?

682
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,945
Yes, yes...

683
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,788
Keep on coming, you...

684
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:25,978
...and join the others.

685
00:40:26,178 --> 00:40:28,263
Join the others and...

686
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:36,159
Here we are at a fancy
costume party...

687
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:37,345
...in Kensington.

688
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:41,526
That's your dad dressed up
as a Roman Centurion.

689
00:40:49,285 --> 00:40:51,518
In what capacity were you
actually friends with my dad?

690
00:40:51,622 --> 00:40:53,307
I mean no offense...

691
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,776
...but he never mentioned
you to me...

692
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,233
...and you have all these
pictures with him...

693
00:40:58,337 --> 00:41:00,422
...as if you were...

694
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:20,970
"Screen Goddesses"

695
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,283
Oh God.

696
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,472
Oh my God!

697
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,835
I know this might come as
quite a shock to you

698
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:40,584
I'm sure he would have told you
himself...

699
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:43,488
...but he wasn't sure how
you'd react.

700
00:41:43,592 --> 00:41:44,498
My mother knows of this?

701
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:45,810
No.

702
00:41:45,914 --> 00:41:49,383
And there's no reason
she should find out.

703
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:52,501
As long as I get what's
owed to me.

704
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,146
What?

705
00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:57,188
Well, I think I deserve
something.

706
00:41:58,044 --> 00:42:00,614
Your father and I
were lovers.

707
00:42:02,574 --> 00:42:05,878
He left me absolutely nothing in
his will.

708
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,963
How do you think that makes
me feel?

709
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,867
I'll tell you how it makes
me feel.

710
00:42:09,971 --> 00:42:11,465
Cheap.

711
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:13,655
Like a cheap slut.

712
00:42:13,912 --> 00:42:16,517
Don't you think
I deserve something?

713
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:18,707
What do you want?

714
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:23,389
Well I think 15,000 pounds
should do it.

715
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:25,947
15,000 pounds?

716
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:27,381
I'm supposed to be
buying a flat.

717
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:29,210
Well that's up to you.

718
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:31,156
Wait a minute...

719
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,116
You think you can come in here
and show me...

720
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:34,500
...pictures of you and my dad...

721
00:42:34,604 --> 00:42:36,328
...on a bus, and that counts as proof?

722
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:38,559
That's no fucking proof.

723
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,325
What's that?

724
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,191
Jesus

725
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,380
Now, I don't want to.

726
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:50,559
But I'll go out there and I'll show
these photos to every single person.

727
00:42:50,664 --> 00:42:53,500
Do you really want me
to do that?

728
00:42:56,522 --> 00:42:58,210
You wait here.

729
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:00,400
Wait here.

730
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:03,712
Daniel.

731
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:06,323
I was telling George here
how when we were boys,...

732
00:43:06,428 --> 00:43:11,036
...your dad loved to makes us go
naked to take a bath.

733
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:29,377
Simon, open the door.

734
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,667
Anything I can do
to help?

735
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:35,020
Not really. Thanks.

736
00:43:35,124 --> 00:43:37,210
Everything under control?

737
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,399
Simon?

738
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:41,180
So what are you doing next weekend?

739
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:42,805
I've got a couple of tickets
and backstage passes...

740
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:44,528
Look Justin. I've got
a lot on my plate right now...

741
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:45,773
...and I can't deal with
your shit.

742
00:43:45,877 --> 00:43:48,359
Can you please just go away?

743
00:43:48,601 --> 00:43:50,686
Please.

744
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,753
Simon?

745
00:43:59,265 --> 00:44:00,314
Can I talk to you?

746
00:44:00,419 --> 00:44:01,039
Not now.

747
00:44:01,143 --> 00:44:03,062
It's important.

748
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:03,994
It's okay.

749
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:06,184
Excuse us.

750
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:08,509
What are you doing?

751
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:16,741
Remember the little guy
from before that we didn't know...

752
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:17,936
...the short guy.

753
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,477
Yeah.

754
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:21,012
I was just being with him
in the study.

755
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,202
And?

756
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,701
He showed me these pictures.

757
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:26,663
Yeah.

758
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,983
- Of him and Dad.
- Right.

759
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:30,998
Of him and Dad together.

760
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:33,188
Right.

761
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:35,289
Him and Dad together at parties
in Kensington...

762
00:44:35,393 --> 00:44:36,690
Is this going anywhere?
'Cause...

763
00:44:36,794 --> 00:44:38,880
He was shacking Dad.

764
00:44:39,249 --> 00:44:41,334
Fuck off.

765
00:44:45,357 --> 00:44:46,505
You shitting me?

766
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:47,548
I'm not shitting you.
I'm telling you.

767
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:50,848
He showed me the pictures.
I feel sick.

768
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:52,690
What are you saying?

769
00:44:52,794 --> 00:44:54,402
Dad was a gay?

770
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:56,592
That's what I'm saying.

771
00:44:57,035 --> 00:44:58,500
And he was cheating on Mom?

772
00:44:58,604 --> 00:45:00,112
Evidently.

773
00:45:00,216 --> 00:45:01,947
With that little...

774
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,950
Yes.

775
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:05,404
I know it's a bombshell...

776
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:07,345
...but the concern right now
is that he wants money.

777
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:08,254
What do you mean?

778
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:09,984
He wants money.
He wants 15,000 pounds.

779
00:45:10,088 --> 00:45:11,259
Tell him to go fuck himself.

780
00:45:11,363 --> 00:45:12,866
Don't you understand?
He's got the pictures.

781
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,820
If we don't give him the money
he's gonna tell everybody here...

782
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,590
...the most intimate details
of their sex life.

783
00:45:16,695 --> 00:45:18,030
Well I don't want to hear
those intimate details.

784
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:18,918
Exactly.

785
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:21,107
What 're we gonna do?

786
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,676
Shit.

787
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:25,866
Think then.

788
00:45:26,747 --> 00:45:28,832
Well okay, alright...

789
00:45:33,227 --> 00:45:34,940
What a fucking waste of time.

790
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:36,250
I don't know why I even
bothered.

791
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:38,236
I dressed up and everything...

792
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,838
And she's more interested
in that idiot...

793
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:42,027
...than she's in me.

794
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,258
I tell you, this world is
severely fucked.

795
00:45:44,362 --> 00:45:45,624
Sounds serious.
Doesn't it?

796
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:48,032
- What?
- Pigment mutation.

797
00:45:51,137 --> 00:45:53,001
Can you taste this?
I think it has almonds in it.

798
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:53,827
Yeah?

799
00:45:53,932 --> 00:45:56,103
So, Daniel's uncle said I'm
allergic to almonds.

800
00:45:56,207 --> 00:45:57,262
Don't eat it then.

801
00:45:57,366 --> 00:45:58,583
Be a friend. Taste it.
Tell me what you think.

802
00:45:58,687 --> 00:45:59,355
No.

803
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:00,602
Come on taste it.

804
00:46:00,706 --> 00:46:01,574
I won't.

805
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:04,353
Come on, please. Can't you
just do me a favor?

806
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:06,673
Will you please fuck off.

807
00:46:08,497 --> 00:46:10,043
Have you seen a pill bottle
lying around?

808
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:12,011
It looked like a Valium bottle.

809
00:46:12,115 --> 00:46:12,788
No.

810
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:14,978
Shit.

811
00:46:27,106 --> 00:46:29,192
It won't be long now.

812
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:38,569
Shall we go inside?

813
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:40,758
In a minute.

814
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:49,784
Doctor, could you...

815
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,328
Hello

816
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:05,159
I'm sorry about...

817
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:07,853
Thank you.

818
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,667
It must me terrible losing
a husband.

819
00:47:11,772 --> 00:47:14,974
You're still so young.

820
00:47:16,905 --> 00:47:18,528
Are you gonna get married again?

821
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:21,816
It's not an easy thing to
say, is it?

822
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,770
It's just terrible isn't it?
People die...

823
00:47:24,874 --> 00:47:25,617
How awful is that?

824
00:47:25,722 --> 00:47:27,544
There was a guy that I know...

825
00:47:27,648 --> 00:47:30,301
...someone stabbed him to death
because he called his mother "moose".

826
00:47:30,405 --> 00:47:32,240
And the guy just...

827
00:47:32,345 --> 00:47:34,356
...stabbed him right in the neck.

828
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,562
He cut a major artery.

829
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,616
And you want believe how
much blood...

830
00:47:41,143 --> 00:47:43,223
was bursting absolutely
everywhere...

831
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,515
And the ridiculous thing is that
the guy who did it...

832
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:51,114
...told the police later, he didn't
even know what "moose" was.

833
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:54,142
The cake has almonds in it?

834
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,782
It's alright.
Doesn't matter.

835
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,170
Excuse me.

836
00:48:04,206 --> 00:48:06,291
Nice talking to you.

837
00:48:16,732 --> 00:48:17,803
Let me rephrase the question.

838
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:20,414
What do you mean it's best that
I pay the money?

839
00:48:20,518 --> 00:48:22,480
Well you've been living off
Mom and Dad. You must have...

840
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:23,140
...some money left.

841
00:48:23,244 --> 00:48:24,570
I haven't been...

842
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:26,590
I paid for this
entire funeral Robert.

843
00:48:26,694 --> 00:48:28,571
Wait a second.

844
00:48:28,675 --> 00:48:32,841
How do you know this guy isn't
bullshitting you?

845
00:48:36,184 --> 00:48:38,269
God!

846
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,945
Simon?

847
00:48:42,532 --> 00:48:44,618
Simon?

848
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,836
Simon?

849
00:48:48,322 --> 00:48:49,268
Simon?

850
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:51,458
Simon?

851
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:54,433
Simon?

852
00:48:54,537 --> 00:48:56,622
Simon!

853
00:48:57,698 --> 00:48:59,618
Si?

854
00:48:59,722 --> 00:49:01,807
...mon!

855
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:12,520
I think we're just about ready to
resume the ceremony...

856
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:14,171
Would you mind giving us five minutes?

857
00:49:14,276 --> 00:49:16,361
- Of course.
- Thanks.

858
00:49:21,455 --> 00:49:22,455
What's going on?

859
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,625
I'm really sorry but I think
our moving out plans...

860
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,258
...will have to be put on hold.
Just for a little while.

861
00:49:27,362 --> 00:49:28,028
What do you mean?
Why?

862
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,335
I don't have time to explain
right now.

863
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:31,468
I wouldn't do this unless
I really had to.

864
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:32,569
What's the reason?

865
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:35,510
I can't explain right now, okay?

866
00:49:44,203 --> 00:49:47,127
So you're the blackmailing prick.

867
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:49,712
What're you doing with that?

868
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:52,170
It's my manuscript.
It's not to be read by anyone.

869
00:49:52,274 --> 00:49:53,831
You shouldn't leave it
lying around, Daniel...

870
00:49:53,935 --> 00:49:55,273
...if you don't want people to
read it.

871
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:56,103
This is my office.

872
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:58,587
Guys! Can we just
get to the point?

873
00:49:58,692 --> 00:50:00,777
Fine by me.

874
00:50:04,322 --> 00:50:06,273
I'll write you this check and that's
the end of it. Yes?

875
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:08,295
You give us the photos and you stay
out of our lives for ever.

876
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:10,615
- Yeah?
- That's the deal.

877
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:29,394
Is that your first attempt?

878
00:50:29,499 --> 00:50:30,316
What?

879
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,942
That's your first novel
isn't it?

880
00:50:32,046 --> 00:50:34,018
Yeah.

881
00:50:34,122 --> 00:50:34,835
So?

882
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:37,025
So, nothing.

883
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:41,220
I tried to write once.
It didn't work for me.

884
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:45,996
I think it's like a gift.
You either have it or you don't.

885
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,827
It must be hard for you
though, Daniel...

886
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:50,813
...living up to your brother's
reputation.

887
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:54,651
Always living in the shadow
of a sibling like that.

888
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:56,229
By the way...

889
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,814
...I read your latest novel.

890
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,574
Really good stuff.

891
00:51:02,037 --> 00:51:04,123
Thanks.

892
00:51:05,404 --> 00:51:07,490
Alright. That's it.

893
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:09,627
Daniel, what the hell
are you doing?

894
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:13,108
There's no way I'm giving this ass
a penny of my money.

895
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:14,463
Don't be ridiculous.

896
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:16,653
Why should I?

897
00:51:17,092 --> 00:51:18,620
He comes in here in the day
of our father's fuberal...

898
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:20,792
...he tries to blackmail us
and bad mouths my novel.

899
00:51:20,896 --> 00:51:21,849
Who does he think he is?

900
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:22,871
He has the photos.

901
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:24,309
Let him show the photos.
I don't care.

902
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:25,084
Daniel.

903
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:27,111
No Robert.
I give up, okay?

904
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:28,706
I give up.
I can't take anymore.

905
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:33,419
If that's what he's going to do,
fine, let him do it.

906
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:36,226
No problem.

907
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,153
What?

908
00:51:38,257 --> 00:51:40,333
Wait, wait...

909
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:42,684
Please, get out of my way.

910
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:44,283
Let's discuss this
a minute.

911
00:51:44,388 --> 00:51:46,541
There's nothing to discuss.

912
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,730
Get out of my way.

913
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:56,199
Get up and help, Daniel!

914
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,656
What are you doing Robert?

915
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,274
Get a rope or something!

916
00:52:01,378 --> 00:52:03,042
We don't have any rope.

917
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:04,672
Get something...

918
00:52:04,776 --> 00:52:06,903
There, from the curtain.

919
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:08,495
Take it.

920
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,685
Tie his legs.

921
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,420
Jesus Robert.
This is a really bad idea.

922
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,995
Fucking men.

923
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,185
Tell me about it.

924
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:03,072
Daniel, get that tie.

925
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:03,622
Why?

926
00:53:03,726 --> 00:53:05,653
Just get it.

927
00:53:05,757 --> 00:53:07,087
What are we gonna
do with it?

928
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:09,370
- Do whatever
- But I don't know.

929
00:53:09,474 --> 00:53:10,848
Stuff it in his mouth.

930
00:53:10,952 --> 00:53:11,749
This is ridiculous.

931
00:53:11,854 --> 00:53:13,104
Daniel?

932
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:15,294
Jesus.
Shut the door!

933
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:18,407
Why? What's going on?
Who's that?

934
00:53:18,511 --> 00:53:19,918
It's a seizure.

935
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:21,662
God... really?

936
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:23,978
I just found some Valium.

937
00:53:24,082 --> 00:53:24,891
Bring them here.

938
00:53:24,996 --> 00:53:25,796
How many?

939
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:26,771
I don't know.

940
00:53:26,876 --> 00:53:27,690
A handful.

941
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:29,880
Really? Okay.

942
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:33,732
Wait, you dropped one.

943
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:35,451
Open his mouth.

944
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:36,831
Okay.

945
00:53:36,935 --> 00:53:39,010
It will be alright.

946
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:40,610
Have you seen a little bottle?

947
00:53:40,714 --> 00:53:41,887
Jesus, Howard...

948
00:53:41,991 --> 00:53:43,647
...I told you to lock the
fucking door.

949
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:45,001
You said to shut the
fucking door.

950
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:45,795
What's going on?

951
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:46,519
Oh, he's having a seizure.

952
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,877
Seizure?

953
00:53:47,981 --> 00:53:50,067
Why is he all tied up?

954
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:01,645
Hello.

955
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:04,156
He's blackmailing you?
Over what?

956
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:05,137
It doesn't matter now.

957
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,157
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

958
00:54:06,262 --> 00:54:07,289
It's personal.

959
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:08,004
Why?

960
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:09,361
He said it's personal.

961
00:54:09,466 --> 00:54:10,072
But why?

962
00:54:10,176 --> 00:54:11,024
Just trust us.

963
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:12,870
This is not a good guy.

964
00:54:12,974 --> 00:54:14,409
So, what are we gonna
do with him?

965
00:54:14,513 --> 00:54:16,868
- What're we gonna do?
- I don't know.

966
00:54:16,972 --> 00:54:18,544
What do you mean
you don't know?

967
00:54:18,649 --> 00:54:20,221
Shut up Daniel.
I've had enough.

968
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:22,797
How long is the Valium
gonna last?

969
00:54:22,902 --> 00:54:23,423
What is it?

970
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:24,560
- Valium?
- Yeah.

971
00:54:24,664 --> 00:54:26,406
Yeah, I found those Valium.

972
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:30,499
We gave him a few to calm him
down. Thank you.

973
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:33,235
Shit.

974
00:54:33,339 --> 00:54:35,424
What is it?

975
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:37,169
What's wrong?

976
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,358
Fuck!

977
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,996
What?

978
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:48,094
Thing is...

979
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,348
...it's not really Valium.

980
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:51,878
It's mostly acid.

981
00:54:51,982 --> 00:54:52,776
What?!

982
00:54:52,881 --> 00:54:55,182
Simon took one by mistake, that's
why he's acting like this.

983
00:54:55,286 --> 00:54:56,640
And what are you doing with this?

984
00:54:56,744 --> 00:54:57,662
They're for a friend.

985
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:58,583
Wait a minute.

986
00:54:58,687 --> 00:54:59,709
You're telling us that..

987
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:03,775
Martha's boyfriend who knocked over
Dad's coffin had just one of these things.

988
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:04,819
And you gave him how many?

989
00:55:04,924 --> 00:55:06,901
Five.

990
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:09,061
You can't blame me for this.

991
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:10,062
Poor bastard.

992
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:11,310
We should call an ambulance.

993
00:55:11,414 --> 00:55:12,752
Can't do that.
You'll be screwed.

994
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:16,959
They're gonna find out he's been
force-fed hard drugs.

995
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,334
What's gonna happen?
Is he gonna die?

996
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:21,275
No.

997
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:23,679
That is, I don't think so.

998
00:55:23,784 --> 00:55:25,865
Daniel?

999
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:30,213
Robert?

1000
00:55:30,317 --> 00:55:32,835
We'll be out in a
minute, Mom.

1001
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:34,590
We need to go outside.

1002
00:55:34,694 --> 00:55:37,885
You two stay here
and look after him.

1003
00:55:39,793 --> 00:55:40,522
Look after him?

1004
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:42,332
What do you mean?
What're we supposed to do?

1005
00:55:42,436 --> 00:55:44,137
Make sure he doesn't escape.

1006
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:46,368
Lock the door behind us.

1007
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:48,966
Hi Mom.
How's it going?

1008
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:50,377
Reverend Davis needs to
speak to you.

1009
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:52,667
Can we resume the service now?

1010
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:54,555
I need to leave by 3.

1011
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:56,376
Yes, that's great. But we
need to have a chat.

1012
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,964
So can we take five more minutes?

1013
00:55:58,068 --> 00:56:00,993
- Of course.
- Is there a problem?

1014
00:56:01,264 --> 00:56:03,349
Jesus.

1015
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:10,060
Why didn't you just pay him
the fucking money?

1016
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:17,403
Where's my tea?

1017
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:21,308
What's your problem?

1018
00:56:22,314 --> 00:56:24,400
Women.

1019
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:27,047
Women, women...

1020
00:56:27,868 --> 00:56:30,536
Let me tell you something
about women.

1021
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,054
When I was a young man...

1022
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:36,300
...I use to go out with the most
beautiful woman in the village.

1023
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:39,180
She'd walk into the room
and everyone's eyes would turn.

1024
00:56:39,284 --> 00:56:41,278
Everyone wanted to fuck her.

1025
00:56:41,383 --> 00:56:44,839
And of course she
liked the attention...

1026
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,115
I have to take a shit.

1027
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,274
I can't believe you gave
him five pills.

1028
00:56:56,378 --> 00:56:57,786
Who can we blame for this?

1029
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,141
Even if it was Valium, you should never
give him five. Don't you know anything?

1030
00:57:00,246 --> 00:57:02,573
No, I don't know about
giving pills.

1031
00:57:02,677 --> 00:57:04,763
Hello?

1032
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,833
Yes?

1033
00:57:09,937 --> 00:57:12,023
I need the toilet.

1034
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:14,597
Could you use the
one upstairs?

1035
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:16,468
I'm on a wheelchair you
fucking idiot.

1036
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:18,552
How am I supposed
to get upstairs?

1037
00:57:18,656 --> 00:57:20,742
Open the door.

1038
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:23,242
Wait a minute.

1039
00:57:23,346 --> 00:57:24,250
God.

1040
00:57:24,355 --> 00:57:25,291
What do we do?

1041
00:57:25,395 --> 00:57:27,611
Put him behind the couch.

1042
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,783
We're looking for the key.

1043
00:57:31,887 --> 00:57:33,927
Hurry.

1044
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:36,071
Shut up!

1045
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:38,830
Hurry up!

1046
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,020
Coming.

1047
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:45,700
Hello.

1048
00:57:45,804 --> 00:57:49,172
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

1049
00:57:49,873 --> 00:57:51,690
I'm about to shit
in my trousers.

1050
00:57:51,795 --> 00:57:53,880
Come on.

1051
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:58,594
Justin, what is it now?

1052
00:57:58,698 --> 00:58:00,261
Just want to talk to you.

1053
00:58:00,365 --> 00:58:02,259
Please don't make me go
through this again.

1054
00:58:02,363 --> 00:58:05,031
What are you so afraid
of, Martha?

1055
00:58:05,136 --> 00:58:05,925
I know you feel the same way.

1056
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:07,510
You can't fight what
we had together.

1057
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:09,495
Justin, it was one night,
it was a massive mistake.

1058
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,262
I was drunk and out of my mind.
It could have been a donkey.

1059
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,255
What's he got that
I don't have?

1060
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,217
Okay.

1061
00:58:16,322 --> 00:58:18,226
For one thing, he's responsible...

1062
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:20,332
...he's thoughtful,
he's intelligent...

1063
00:58:20,436 --> 00:58:23,981
...he's stable...
Is that enough for you?

1064
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,328
Stop acting as if this is
all my fault.

1065
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:40,111
I'm not the one who attacked the guy
and tied him up.

1066
00:58:40,215 --> 00:58:41,451
Someone had to look out
for Mom.

1067
00:58:41,555 --> 00:58:43,597
I've been looking out for Mom
since you dissapeared...

1068
00:58:43,701 --> 00:58:44,486
...and went to New York...

1069
00:58:44,591 --> 00:58:47,182
...to fool around with your
celebrity friends.

1070
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:48,943
You're really unbelievable.

1071
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:50,418
You can't get over it,
can you?

1072
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:51,463
Get over what?

1073
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:53,205
You're burning with jealousy...

1074
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:56,473
...because you spend three years
working on a novel...

1075
00:58:56,577 --> 00:58:57,794
...and you won't even let
anyone see it.

1076
00:58:57,898 --> 00:58:59,218
And why should I?

1077
00:58:59,323 --> 00:59:02,168
What will you do?
Wait until you're dead?

1078
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,359
And hope that it
gets published?

1079
00:59:04,463 --> 00:59:05,877
You just write
common crap.

1080
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:07,214
It's not crap.

1081
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:08,100
You're a hypocrite.

1082
00:59:08,204 --> 00:59:10,863
And you're the most selfish...

1083
00:59:11,932 --> 00:59:14,059
Daniel, what's going on?

1084
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,415
This is your father's funeral.

1085
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,478
Not now, Jane.

1086
00:59:16,582 --> 00:59:17,901
Why are you acting like this?

1087
00:59:18,005 --> 00:59:20,091
Jane, not now...

1088
00:59:22,485 --> 00:59:24,224
It's about the flat
isn't it?

1089
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:24,841
What?

1090
00:59:24,945 --> 00:59:26,989
Because you don't want to go
do you?

1091
00:59:27,093 --> 00:59:27,601
Jane...

1092
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:29,517
Tell her Daniel.

1093
00:59:29,622 --> 00:59:31,707
Tell me what?

1094
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:38,481
Jane, do you remember
that short...

1095
00:59:38,586 --> 00:59:40,207
...man, that I pointed at
earlier?

1096
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:41,034
- You remember?
- Yes.

1097
00:59:41,138 --> 00:59:43,464
It turns out, he had an affair
with Dad.

1098
00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:45,662
And now he's blackmailing us
into giving him 15,000 pounds...

1099
00:59:45,766 --> 00:59:48,831
...or else he's going to show the
pictures where they're doing... stuff.

1100
00:59:48,935 --> 00:59:51,021
- Sex stuff.
- Yeah.

1101
00:59:52,951 --> 00:59:54,765
Is this some short
of a sick joke?

1102
00:59:54,869 --> 00:59:57,616
Of course it's not a sick joke.

1103
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,436
Your father was gay?

1104
01:00:03,087 --> 01:00:04,151
- Hurry up.
- I am...

1105
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:05,867
Hurry up.

1106
01:00:05,971 --> 01:00:08,187
I'm going to go!
Hurry up!

1107
01:00:08,469 --> 01:00:10,554
- Quick.
- Give me that.

1108
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:11,666
Lift me.
Help me.

1109
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:12,852
I am.

1110
01:00:12,956 --> 01:00:14,009
Put your arms around me.

1111
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,362
Lift me.

1112
01:00:15,466 --> 01:00:17,551
Christ!

1113
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:18,981
You weigh a ton.

1114
01:00:19,085 --> 01:00:20,199
- You got me?
- Yes I've got you.

1115
01:00:20,303 --> 01:00:21,206
Sure I got you.

1116
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:21,910
Quickly!

1117
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:23,796
Alright. I'm trying to see
where the toilet is.

1118
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,780
Get my trousers down.

1119
01:00:24,885 --> 01:00:25,614
Shit...

1120
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:27,397
No, you do it.
I'll hold you.

1121
01:00:27,502 --> 01:00:29,330
How can I do it?
I'm handicapped.

1122
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:31,121
Get it down!

1123
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:33,299
Fuck

1124
01:00:33,403 --> 01:00:35,278
- Hurry up
- I am

1125
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,519
Alright, do it.

1126
01:00:36,623 --> 01:00:38,184
Underpants, underpants...

1127
01:00:38,288 --> 01:00:39,668
Move it, come on.

1128
01:00:39,772 --> 01:00:41,857
Quick, quick...

1129
01:00:41,965 --> 01:00:43,678
I have to go...
I have to go...

1130
01:00:43,782 --> 01:00:45,405
it's down.
Everything is down!

1131
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,561
- Over there?
- I don't know.

1132
01:00:46,665 --> 01:00:47,597
Over there?

1133
01:00:47,701 --> 01:00:48,218
Yes.

1134
01:00:48,322 --> 01:00:49,664
- Are you sure?
- Yes sit down!

1135
01:00:49,768 --> 01:00:51,853
- Sure?
- Sit down!

1136
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:54,557
Sit down!

1137
01:00:54,661 --> 01:00:55,620
Wait!
Wait a moment!

1138
01:00:55,724 --> 01:00:57,809
Oh, that's better.

1139
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,113
God.

1140
01:01:08,182 --> 01:01:09,264
God!

1141
01:01:09,368 --> 01:01:10,716
What's with all the noise?

1142
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:12,906
Oh God!

1143
01:01:23,564 --> 01:01:25,650
Howard?

1144
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:29,676
Howard?

1145
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,288
Please. Clean up!

1146
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:34,200
Howard?

1147
01:01:34,304 --> 01:01:36,389
What?

1148
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:38,975
You missed a bit.

1149
01:01:50,889 --> 01:01:54,502
The shit in your mouth will be the least
to worry about if we get caught.

1150
01:01:54,606 --> 01:01:56,910
I've got shit in my mouth?

1151
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:17,674
Check him. Touch him.

1152
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,088
Are you alright mate?

1153
01:02:23,468 --> 01:02:25,554
try again.

1154
01:02:26,886 --> 01:02:28,670
Mate?

1155
01:02:28,774 --> 01:02:29,496
Mate?

1156
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,686
Wake him up.

1157
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:33,023
Mate.

1158
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:33,948
What's his name?

1159
01:02:34,052 --> 01:02:36,138
I don't know.

1160
01:02:36,579 --> 01:02:38,664
try Philip.

1161
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:48,724
Philip?

1162
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,495
Philip?
Wake up mate.

1163
01:02:56,779 --> 01:02:57,868
Are you okay?

1164
01:02:57,972 --> 01:02:58,668
Shit.

1165
01:02:58,772 --> 01:03:00,858
Philip?

1166
01:03:04,016 --> 01:03:05,460
He might not be a Philip.

1167
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:07,650
Maybe something else.

1168
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,321
Pinch him.

1169
01:03:09,425 --> 01:03:11,511
Please.
Pinch him.

1170
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,277
Mate?

1171
01:03:19,844 --> 01:03:21,929
I think he's breathing.

1172
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:25,264
What?

1173
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,454
He must be breathing.

1174
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:42,286
Shit.

1175
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,475
- Is he okay?
- No.

1176
01:03:47,442 --> 01:03:49,528
He's dead.

1177
01:03:53,895 --> 01:03:56,207
If that's the way it is,
we have to give him the money.

1178
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:58,567
It's not that simple.

1179
01:03:58,671 --> 01:03:59,349
Why not?

1180
01:03:59,453 --> 01:04:01,307
Daniel refused to pay, so...

1181
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:03,127
...we're completely fucked.

1182
01:04:03,231 --> 01:04:05,317
Just shut up.

1183
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,739
Sorry.

1184
01:04:24,734 --> 01:04:27,392
Hi, sorry, may I come through?

1185
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:33,456
Just getting through.
Thank you.

1186
01:04:42,063 --> 01:04:45,253
Why are you smiling like that
Howard?

1187
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,233
I wonder if I could
ask you too...

1188
01:04:48,338 --> 01:04:51,429
...come to the study for a second?

1189
01:04:55,709 --> 01:04:57,623
We'll be back soon.

1190
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,812
Alright.

1191
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,395
It's Howard.

1192
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:13,419
Jesus.
What is this?

1193
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,342
It's...
Call Uncle Victor.

1194
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:17,212
No point.

1195
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:18,077
What do you mean?

1196
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:20,663
Look at him.
He's stone dead.

1197
01:05:24,772 --> 01:05:27,375
What the hell did
you do to him?!

1198
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,317
We didn't do anything.

1199
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,060
He hit his head on the corner.

1200
01:05:30,165 --> 01:05:31,848
Hit his head on the corner?

1201
01:05:31,952 --> 01:05:35,505
He hit his head. That's what happened.
Why? What do you think?

1202
01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:36,718
This is really bad.

1203
01:05:36,822 --> 01:05:38,207
This is really, really bad.

1204
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:39,285
What're we gonna do?

1205
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:40,662
Actually, I really got to go.

1206
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:41,871
You're not going anywhere.

1207
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:43,880
I can't go to prison.

1208
01:05:43,984 --> 01:05:47,089
You have any idea what they do to
blokes like me in prison?

1209
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:48,964
I can't go to prison

1210
01:05:49,068 --> 01:05:51,154
Howard. Just calm down.

1211
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:57,789
Now...

1212
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,909
Nobody here knows, who this
guy is right?

1213
01:06:02,013 --> 01:06:03,689
They don't even
know his name.

1214
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,861
Probably didn't even
notice him.

1215
01:06:05,965 --> 01:06:08,595
Didn't notice him?
He's four fucking feet tall.

1216
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:12,863
Alright. We'll just get rid of the body
as if he came and left.

1217
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:14,680
Get rid of the body?

1218
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:16,264
What are you talking about?

1219
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:18,934
What do we know about
getting rid of bodies?

1220
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:23,933
What are you gonna do. Will you
throw him out in the rubbish?

1221
01:06:24,038 --> 01:06:25,430
Any of you happened to notice...

1222
01:06:25,534 --> 01:06:28,724
...the size of Uncle Eddie's coffin?

1223
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,476
Are you suggesting that we bury
him with my father?

1224
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,092
Why not?

1225
01:06:35,196 --> 01:06:37,817
it's not like he's gonna
know, is he?

1226
01:06:37,921 --> 01:06:40,092
That's not the point.

1227
01:06:42,444 --> 01:06:44,529
it makes sense Daniel.

1228
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,944
The coffin is there, the hole in the
ground is there...

1229
01:06:47,048 --> 01:06:49,233
...they go, and that's all.
End of story.

1230
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:52,350
Unless you got
a better suggestion.

1231
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,365
I mean, come on look...

1232
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:06,313
...you got to do whatever it
is in life

1233
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:07,982
...that get you up the most.

1234
01:07:08,087 --> 01:07:08,969
Yeah.

1235
01:07:09,073 --> 01:07:11,942
But maybe I don't consider my life
anymore as being me,me,me...

1236
01:07:12,047 --> 01:07:15,677
...maybe I've discovered something out
of myself that I care about.

1237
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,178
And maybe you should do it
too, Justin.

1238
01:07:18,282 --> 01:07:21,629
That's a bit harsh, 'cause
I really care about you.

1239
01:07:21,733 --> 01:07:23,845
No Justin. You care
about you.

1240
01:07:23,949 --> 01:07:25,772
You care about me in relation
to how I affect you.

1241
01:07:25,877 --> 01:07:27,962
There's a difference.

1242
01:07:28,081 --> 01:07:30,166
No. That's not true.

1243
01:07:30,728 --> 01:07:32,814
Martha.

1244
01:07:36,021 --> 01:07:37,075
I love you Martha.

1245
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:39,265
No Justin, you don't...

1246
01:07:43,454 --> 01:07:44,398
Jesus fucking Christ!

1247
01:07:44,502 --> 01:07:46,382
Simon!

1248
01:07:46,486 --> 01:07:48,269
Simon.

1249
01:07:48,373 --> 01:07:49,398
Simon?

1250
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:51,051
Simon what the hell
are you doing?

1251
01:07:51,155 --> 01:07:53,376
Come back here and put your clothes
on, this instant!

1252
01:07:53,481 --> 01:07:54,644
I show you kissing him.

1253
01:07:54,748 --> 01:07:56,751
I wasn't kissing him.
I promise you.

1254
01:07:56,856 --> 01:07:59,179
What're you doing?
We're in a bloody funeral.

1255
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:00,364
I'll jump.

1256
01:08:00,469 --> 01:08:02,283
- Don't be silly.
- I'll jump right now!

1257
01:08:02,387 --> 01:08:03,918
I swear to you.

1258
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:04,940
Simon don't be like this.

1259
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:07,977
Do you remember? Drugs.
You got drugs in you.

1260
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:09,857
Just calm down.

1261
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:11,075
Simon, look at me.

1262
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:14,367
Justin, will you get
the fuck out of here?!

1263
01:08:14,472 --> 01:08:15,901
I'm going to do it

1264
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:17,676
I will jump

1265
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,635
- Simon look at me!
- I swear I am

1266
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:21,109
Please calm down.

1267
01:08:21,214 --> 01:08:24,138
- Simon, please.
- I'm gonna jump!

1268
01:08:24,468 --> 01:08:28,013
I'm going to jump...
I'm going to jump...

1269
01:08:29,285 --> 01:08:31,966
This is impossible we cannot do it.

1270
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,485
Howard?

1271
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:34,595
Is that you?

1272
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,366
Shit

1273
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:36,244
Are you in there?

1274
01:08:36,348 --> 01:08:38,016
Yeah.

1275
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:40,779
Hurry get him in the bathroom.

1276
01:08:43,414 --> 01:08:45,500
Howard?

1277
01:08:50,741 --> 01:08:52,827
- Oh shit
- What's that?

1278
01:08:53,932 --> 01:08:56,321
Howard, what the fuck is Uncle Alfie
doing on the toilet?

1279
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:57,265
I forgot him.

1280
01:08:57,369 --> 01:08:58,464
How could you forget?

1281
01:08:58,569 --> 01:08:59,640
What's wrong with you?

1282
01:08:59,745 --> 01:09:01,830
Open the door

1283
01:09:03,144 --> 01:09:03,759
What is it?

1284
01:09:03,863 --> 01:09:04,910
Hi, Daniel.
Where's Howard?

1285
01:09:05,014 --> 01:09:05,866
I'm here.

1286
01:09:05,971 --> 01:09:07,591
Howard, come see this.

1287
01:09:07,695 --> 01:09:10,531
Simon's totally fucking lost it.

1288
01:09:12,735 --> 01:09:14,897
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1289
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:17,768
Simon is on the roof.
He's totally fucking naked.

1290
01:09:17,873 --> 01:09:19,419
He's threatening to jump.

1291
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:20,278
Jesus.

1292
01:09:20,382 --> 01:09:21,179
Where are you going?

1293
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:22,415
I have to go out there.

1294
01:09:22,519 --> 01:09:24,372
If he jumps, I'm fucked.

1295
01:09:24,476 --> 01:09:26,561
Wait here.

1296
01:09:35,694 --> 01:09:37,522
Simon, you're not going to jump.

1297
01:09:37,626 --> 01:09:40,243
I'll jump.
I'm not listening to you.

1298
01:09:40,348 --> 01:09:42,475
Simon, get back in here.

1299
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:46,777
Simon come inside and
we'll have a cop of tea.

1300
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:47,723
No.

1301
01:09:47,828 --> 01:09:48,768
Simon.

1302
01:09:48,872 --> 01:09:50,958
Simon!

1303
01:09:57,412 --> 01:09:59,497
Simon.

1304
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:07,831
Martha.

1305
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:09,948
What the hell are you doing?

1306
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:12,138
Simon.

1307
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:18,803
Martha!

1308
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,366
Get down from there.

1309
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:23,773
What's happening?

1310
01:10:23,877 --> 01:10:25,088
I think I can get rid
of this guy...

1311
01:10:25,192 --> 01:10:26,695
...but I need you to stay outside...

1312
01:10:26,799 --> 01:10:27,886
...and make sure no one comes in.

1313
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:29,532
Okay.

1314
01:10:29,636 --> 01:10:31,721
Martha.

1315
01:10:35,682 --> 01:10:36,304
Who is it?

1316
01:10:36,408 --> 01:10:37,930
It's Daniel

1317
01:10:38,035 --> 01:10:40,048
Everyone's in the garden, we have
to move the body now.

1318
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,238
Brilliant.

1319
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,828
Okay.
Quick.

1320
01:10:49,048 --> 01:10:49,691
Howard.

1321
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:50,972
Stay here and make sure
no one comes in.

1322
01:10:51,076 --> 01:10:53,162
Okay.

1323
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,813
Hello Reverend.
How are you?

1324
01:10:59,132 --> 01:11:01,348
How is God doing... today?

1325
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:09,200
God is a funny one, isn't he?

1326
01:11:09,305 --> 01:11:10,097
Excuse me.

1327
01:11:10,201 --> 01:11:12,287
Yeah, okay

1328
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:14,360
Daniel, we have to do this, right?

1329
01:11:14,465 --> 01:11:16,550
Yeah.

1330
01:11:20,471 --> 01:11:21,895
I wanted to ask you
about religion...

1331
01:11:21,999 --> 01:11:24,190
...and how could I become a priest
if I wanted to...

1332
01:11:24,294 --> 01:11:25,710
...because I've seen you today,
and you're amazing.

1333
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,900
I'm glad to hear that.

1334
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:31,612
God, we can't leave them like that.

1335
01:11:35,534 --> 01:11:38,216
You know, in a strange way, maybe this
is what Dad wanted.

1336
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,988
For God's sake Robert.
Can't you take anything seriously?

1337
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:44,360
Sundays, is it true...

1338
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:49,215
...the wine is sweeter...

1339
01:11:50,046 --> 01:11:50,821
...or not?

1340
01:11:50,925 --> 01:11:53,072
Listen, we'll deal with this later.

1341
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:55,746
I'd like to get to the phone.

1342
01:11:58,208 --> 01:11:59,872
Why do you say I can't take
anything seriously?

1343
01:11:59,977 --> 01:12:00,814
I'll tell you why.

1344
01:12:00,918 --> 01:12:02,536
Because you disappear half way
around the world...

1345
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:04,415
...and you hardly ever come back
to see your parents.

1346
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:07,083
Because you spend the last of
your money on a 1st class ticket...

1347
01:12:07,188 --> 01:12:09,085
...when you know you're supposed
to give me the half for the funeral.

1348
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,863
Because you live your life as if you're
on a fairground...

1349
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:16,091
...and 'cause you never ever, gave
a shit about anyone but yourself.

1350
01:12:16,195 --> 01:12:18,503
I didn't know anything about this
disturbed young man on the roof.

1351
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:22,535
I have a confession to make.
I have these thoughts about...

1352
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:24,943
...sticking a pen
up my bum.

1353
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,360
You're what?

1354
01:12:27,465 --> 01:12:30,301
Simon, this is really dangerous.

1355
01:12:31,421 --> 01:12:33,483
Please.

1356
01:12:33,587 --> 01:12:35,629
Leave me alone.

1357
01:12:35,733 --> 01:12:37,797
Sit there.

1358
01:12:56,029 --> 01:12:58,333
I'll never be good enough.

1359
01:12:58,996 --> 01:13:02,262
Not for your dad, not for you
I'll never be rich enough...

1360
01:13:02,366 --> 01:13:03,856
...I'll never be cool enough.

1361
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,420
Simon, stop talking this nonsense
and just come inside.

1362
01:13:06,524 --> 01:13:08,650
No, you go inside.

1363
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:09,669
Come with me.

1364
01:13:09,773 --> 01:13:11,859
No. Why?

1365
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,798
'Cause we're gonna have a baby.

1366
01:13:21,682 --> 01:13:23,767
What?

1367
01:13:24,115 --> 01:13:27,397
We'll have a child together.

1368
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:33,065
You're pregnant?

1369
01:13:33,169 --> 01:13:36,448
How would I be able to it
without you?

1370
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:07,349
- What's that? Excuse me.
- I don't know... Now look...

1371
01:14:11,901 --> 01:14:13,987
Bye Dad.

1372
01:14:25,103 --> 01:14:27,230
We're gonna have a baby!

1373
01:14:29,627 --> 01:14:31,712
Jesus.

1374
01:14:37,781 --> 01:14:41,559
Listen to me everyone.
Simon is off the roof.

1375
01:14:41,663 --> 01:14:43,749
I will kill him.

1376
01:14:57,156 --> 01:14:57,853
is he gone?

1377
01:14:57,957 --> 01:14:59,592
Yeah.

1378
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:01,782
Thank God.

1379
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,810
Thank you.

1380
01:15:09,915 --> 01:15:11,388
Martha!

1381
01:15:11,492 --> 01:15:13,578
Martha, open the door.

1382
01:15:17,126 --> 01:15:19,099
Thank God, you're safe.

1383
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:22,194
You idiot.
What were you thinking?!

1384
01:15:22,299 --> 01:15:24,468
I want you to stay away
from my daughter.

1385
01:15:24,573 --> 01:15:25,237
Look Dad...

1386
01:15:25,341 --> 01:15:26,351
Martha, stay out of this.

1387
01:15:26,456 --> 01:15:28,340
Dad, we're getting married.

1388
01:15:28,444 --> 01:15:29,253
What?

1389
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:31,443
We're getting married.

1390
01:15:33,566 --> 01:15:34,772
Martha.

1391
01:15:34,876 --> 01:15:37,632
You don't have to marry this man
just because you're pregnant.

1392
01:15:37,736 --> 01:15:39,054
We can deal with this Martha.

1393
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,942
I'm marrying him because
I love him.

1394
01:15:42,046 --> 01:15:43,760
- You can't
- Yes, I can.

1395
01:15:43,864 --> 01:15:45,273
It's my life and this
is my choice.

1396
01:15:45,377 --> 01:15:50,340
And I'm sorry if you don't like it
but that's just tough.

1397
01:15:50,769 --> 01:15:52,615
And I will tell you
something else.

1398
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,813
If you don't short out
your attitude...

1399
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:59,438
...you're gonna end up a very lonely
bitter old man.

1400
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:07,243
Dad.

1401
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:12,736
Darling, we really must
start again now.

1402
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,255
Daniel, have you seen
Uncle Alfie?

1403
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:17,445
Shit

1404
01:16:29,908 --> 01:16:31,579
What the hell is going on
in there?

1405
01:16:31,683 --> 01:16:32,752
Sorry we forgot you.

1406
01:16:32,856 --> 01:16:34,987
Never mind that. What about that dead
body, you were dragging over there?

1407
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,087
What dead body?

1408
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,441
Don't fuck with me.
I saw a dead body!

1409
01:16:39,545 --> 01:16:42,883
Get me the hell of this
fucking toilet!

1410
01:16:55,841 --> 01:16:57,935
Did you hear that?
She's having a kid.

1411
01:16:58,039 --> 01:16:59,752
I would have done it, if I didn't
know she was having a kid.

1412
01:16:59,857 --> 01:17:00,550
I thought you were in
love with her.

1413
01:17:00,654 --> 01:17:03,494
Yeah, but can you imagine me
bringing up a kid?

1414
01:17:03,599 --> 01:17:04,269
No.

1415
01:17:04,373 --> 01:17:05,299
Exactly.

1416
01:17:05,404 --> 01:17:06,373
How's your skin thing?

1417
01:17:06,478 --> 01:17:07,205
Oh, that...

1418
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,814
It's probably nothing.
To be honest, I'm more concerned about

1419
01:17:08,918 --> 01:17:12,995
...about having Uncle Alfie's shit
in my mouth.

1420
01:17:24,842 --> 01:17:25,871
He was dead.

1421
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:28,775
Why don't you listen, I tell
you, I saw the guy.

1422
01:17:28,879 --> 01:17:29,919
He was dead.

1423
01:17:30,023 --> 01:17:33,372
I know you did Uncle Alfie.
We all did.

1424
01:17:33,477 --> 01:17:36,044
No, in the bathroom. The door
opened and I saw him.

1425
01:17:36,148 --> 01:17:38,794
What a nightmare today's been.

1426
01:17:38,899 --> 01:17:40,702
But exciting, isn't it?

1427
01:17:40,807 --> 01:17:42,949
- What?
- For a funeral I mean.

1428
01:17:43,054 --> 01:17:44,767
About the flat, I promised to call them.

1429
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:46,956
And I will.

1430
01:17:47,077 --> 01:17:49,163
We'll work it out.

1431
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,660
We really have to wheeze
through this now.

1432
01:17:51,764 --> 01:17:52,497
Alright. Let's go.

1433
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:53,661
You want to have the casket open
for people...

1434
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:54,691
No.

1435
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:55,718
Alright. That's fine.

1436
01:17:55,822 --> 01:17:58,790
Sit down everybody, as quick as
you can. We're ready to go.

1437
01:17:58,894 --> 01:18:00,979
Come along. Come on.

1438
01:18:02,528 --> 01:18:04,335
That's it.

1439
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:05,543
Quickly!

1440
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,069
Come on, come on...

1441
01:18:07,173 --> 01:18:09,258
Come on!

1442
01:18:09,661 --> 01:18:11,746
Come on!
Come on!

1443
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:16,858
I'd like to apologise on behalf of the
family for all of the distractions...

1444
01:18:16,963 --> 01:18:19,382
...and that everyone is ready to
continue with the service...

1445
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,247
...and Daniel would like to say a few
words about his father.

1446
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:23,436
Go on Daniel. Quickly.

1447
01:18:40,122 --> 01:18:43,530
My father was an
exceptional man.

1448
01:19:04,518 --> 01:19:07,963
My father was an
exceptional man.

1449
01:19:18,073 --> 01:19:21,192
He was born in 1938
just a year before the war.

1450
01:19:21,297 --> 01:19:23,424
And I'll never forget...

1451
01:19:25,254 --> 01:19:26,845
What the hell is going on?

1452
01:19:26,949 --> 01:19:28,494
There's someone in there.

1453
01:19:28,599 --> 01:19:30,684
I knew it!

1454
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:42,169
What the hell are you doing
in my dad's coffin?

1455
01:19:42,273 --> 01:19:45,780
Edward.

1456
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:49,417
No, no...

1457
01:19:49,849 --> 01:19:51,064
Edward.

1458
01:19:51,168 --> 01:19:52,085
Edward!

1459
01:19:52,189 --> 01:19:58,879
No.

1460
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:14,934
You little bastard!

1461
01:20:19,032 --> 01:20:20,539
Oh God.

1462
01:20:20,644 --> 01:20:23,568
My father was an exceptional man.

1463
01:20:47,632 --> 01:20:50,557
He may not have been
a perfect man.

1464
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:53,027
But he was a good man.

1465
01:20:54,384 --> 01:20:56,469
And he loved us.

1466
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,467
All I wanted to do today
was to give him a dignified...

1467
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:06,205
...sending.
Is that really so much to ask?

1468
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:14,180
So...

1469
01:21:16,072 --> 01:21:18,158
Maybe...

1470
01:21:19,696 --> 01:21:22,717
Maybe he had some things
he liked to do.

1471
01:21:22,822 --> 01:21:25,924
Life isn't simple.
It's complicated.

1472
01:21:28,492 --> 01:21:30,860
We're all just thrown in
here together...

1473
01:21:30,964 --> 01:21:34,598
...in a world full of chaos and
confusion.

1474
01:21:36,126 --> 01:21:38,226
A world full of questions and
no answers.

1475
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:41,039
With Death always lingering
around the corner.

1476
01:21:41,144 --> 01:21:43,229
And we do our best.

1477
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:47,416
We can't always do our best.

1478
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:50,007
My dad did it best.

1479
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:04,495
He always tried to tell me you
have to go for what you want in life...

1480
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,324
...because you never know how long
you're gonna be here.

1481
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:10,085
And whether you succeed
or you fail...

1482
01:22:11,569 --> 01:22:15,469
...the most important thing
is to have tried.

1483
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,345
A parent can only drive you in the
right direction. In the end though...

1484
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:23,463
...you've got to run for yourself.

1485
01:22:26,663 --> 01:22:29,233
You have to grow up yourself.

1486
01:22:34,751 --> 01:22:37,410
So when you leave
here today...

1487
01:22:38,471 --> 01:22:43,789
...I'd like you to remember my father
for what he really was.

1488
01:22:44,132 --> 01:22:46,624
A decent and loving man.

1489
01:22:51,365 --> 01:22:55,176
If only we could be as
giving and generous..

1490
01:22:55,964 --> 01:22:59,243
...and understanding
as my father was.

1491
01:23:00,486 --> 01:23:04,208
Then the world would be a far
better place.

1492
01:23:43,304 --> 01:23:45,389
How's Mom?

1493
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:48,932
She'll survive.

1494
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:54,020
The positive side is...

1495
01:23:54,124 --> 01:23:59,531
...that she knows why she and Dad
haven't had sex for so long.

1496
01:24:02,026 --> 01:24:05,547
I asked to come to New York
with me, for a while.

1497
01:24:05,651 --> 01:24:09,553
So that you and Jane have a chance...
to breathe a bit.

1498
01:24:09,657 --> 01:24:11,743
Get a flat...

1499
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:20,275
Pretty good speech you gave,
by the way.

1500
01:24:20,379 --> 01:24:22,470
It was really...

1501
01:24:27,242 --> 01:24:29,327
...impressive.

1502
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,442
Thanks.

1503
01:24:35,919 --> 01:24:38,973
Maybe when you got time
you wouldn't mind...

1504
01:24:39,077 --> 01:24:41,441
...taking a look at my novel.

1505
01:24:41,545 --> 01:24:43,631
I'd love to, yeah.

1506
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,766
I'm exhausted actually.

1507
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:57,336
Uncle Alfie keeps going on
about the body in the bathroom.

1508
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,644
It's best if he stays
here tonight.

1509
01:24:59,748 --> 01:25:01,835
You think he'll be okay?

1510
01:25:01,939 --> 01:25:08,102
Yeah, he'll be fine. I found him a
couple of Valium and put him to bed.

1511
01:25:09,303 --> 01:25:12,050
Everything's so
fucking green...
