00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,170
poof-- your wife's gonna be opening your
ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

320
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,760
Are you suggesting that we blow
this thing up from the inside?

321
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,790
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- How?

322
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,380
[ Sighs ]
We drill.

323
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,600
We bring in the world's best
deep-core driller.

324
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,590
Harry, get up here.
We're takin' a hit.

325
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,300
- Get A.J. up here!
- Come on!

326
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,270
- Oh, shit!
- [ Yelling ]

327
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
Send another pipe down! Right now!

328
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,650
- [ Yelling Continues ]
- It's a gas pocket!

329
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,020
I told you! Am I lucky,
or am I just a genius?

330
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I shut it down for a reason,
you jackass! The relief valve's--

331
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,040
[ Screaming ]

332
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,490
Shut off the number two valve!
Grace, get the clients out of here now!

333
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,830
[ Alarm Blaring ]

334
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,160
- No, Daddy!
- [ Screaming ]

335
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,470
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!

336
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,550
- Get the hell down!
- This thing is gonna blow.

337
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,890
[ Screaming ]

338
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,020
- [ Yelling Continues ]
- Chick, get down now!

339
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,320
Get down!

340
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,410
[ Dan ] Three dozen research calls, and
every time, the same man is recommended.

341
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,830
He's worked on every terrain
this planet can offer.

342
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,740
Whenever they said it couldn't be
drilled, this guy drilled it.

343
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,910
- Everybody all right?
- We struck oil, baby!

344
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,500
Somebody could've got killed out here
today. You want that on your conscience?

345
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,090
High thumb.
You are man, Harry.

346
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,920
- Thumbs high.
- [ Helicopter Blades Whirring ]

347
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,560
You're fired.

348
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,010
Who's Harry Stamper?

349
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,350
Hey, I'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?

350
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,570
Mr Stamper, I'm General Montgomery,
commander of the Pacific air forces.

351
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,400
I've been sent here
by the secretary of defense...

352
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,110
on direct orders
from the president of the United States.

353
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,370
- [ Chuckling ]
- It's a matter
of urgent national security.

354
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,620
I need you to get on that chopper
right now, no questions asked.

355
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,750
Crazy Willie put you up to this?

356
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,260
I'm afraid I don't know Crazy Willie,
sir. I'm dead serious about this.

357
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,040
- Harry.
- What?

358
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,090
I swear to God,
she never told me her age.

359
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,560
It's all right. Relax. It's about me.

360
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,050
Oh. Forget it!

361
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,310
All right, General,
I'll go with you on one condition.

362
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,320
We're gonna have
to take my daughter along.

363
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,230
- What did I do?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you guys takin' her?

364
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,570
- Sir, stay right here.
- Wh--

365
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,620
Chick, get him paid,
get him off the rig!

366
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
- Mr Stamper?
- Yeah, I'm Harry Stamper.

367
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,430
How you doin'? Miss Stamper.

368
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,430
I'm Dan Truman, Executive Director here.

369
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,770
- Listen, on behalf of all of us,
I'd really like to apologize--
- Apologize.

370
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,220
I don't know if we can take
any more apologies, Mr Truman.

371
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,810
We've been apologized to
for the last 18-and-a-half hours.

372
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,940
So if you don't mind, how about
if we just get on with it?

373
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,940
You tell us why we're here
at the NASA Space Center.

374
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,150
We should probably talk alone.

375
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,820
Mr Truman, I don't keep
any secrets from my daughter, Grace.

376
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,320
So whether you tell her now
or I tell her later, she's gonna
find out one way or the other.

377
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,330
So why don't we just get on with it?

378
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,330
[ Dan ] So when the Rogue
comet hit the asteroid belt,
it sent shrapnel right for us.

379
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,670
For the next 15 days,
the Earth's in a shooting gallery.

380
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,630
Even if the asteroid itself
hits the water, it's still hitting land.

381
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,510
It'll flash boil millions
of gallons of seawater and slam
into the ocean bedrock.

382
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,980
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean impact--
which we think it will be--

383
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,850
it'll create a tidal wave
three miles high,

384
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,560
travelling at 1,000 miles an hour
covering California
and washing up in Denver.

385
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,230
Japan's gone.
Australia's wiped out.

386
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,950
Half the world's population
will be incinerated by the heat blast.

387
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,160
The rest'll freeze to death
from nuclear winter.

388
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,990
[ Whispering ]
That's unbelievable.

389
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,070
Well, actually,
this is as real as it gets.

390
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, it's coming right now.

391
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,260
Right for us at 22,000 miles an hour.

392
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,590
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.

393
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,530
I take it you're not
alerting everyone like this.

394
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,410
Nobody knows.
That's the way it stays.

395
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,870
For the next ten days, there are
only nine telescopes in the world...

396
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,200
that can spot the asteroid,
and we control eight of 'em.

397
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,290
The president's classified
this information top secret.

398
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,250
If news like this got out,

399
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,710
there'd be an overnight breakdown
of basic social services worldwide.

400
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,090
Rioting, mass religious hysteria,
total chaos, you can imagine.

401
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,310
Basically the worst parts of the Bible.

402
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,060
Six billion people on the planet.

403
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,430
Why'd you guys call me?

404
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,940
- We need you to prep the team
we're sending up.
- Up?

405
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,570
We'll send them to the asteroid,
they'll land, drill a hole,
they'll drop some nukes,

406
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,610
take off and detonate,
if we can fix this equipment problem.

407
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,570
The drilling unit's a prototype we've
been building for the Mars project.

408
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,570
You, uh-- You might recognize the rig.

409
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,920
Yeah, well, I guess
I should recognize it. It's my design.

410
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,580
- [ Man Chattering On P.A. ]
- [ Helicopter Blades Whirring ]

411
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,290
- Did you steal a key
to the Patent Office ?
- Yeah, basically.

412
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,270
Let me get this straight.
I got pulled off an oil rig,

413
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,430
flown halfway around the world
because you stole my drill design.

414
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,470
Couldn't read the plans right and did
a pisspoor job of putting it together.

415
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,100
- Patents don't apply to outer space.
- [ Dan ] You shut up, Quincy.

416
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,610
It's not going to Mars any more.
It's gonna try to save this planet.

417
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,940
And we need to know
what's wrong with it pretty quick.

418
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,150
- You said we did a bad job
of putting it together?
- No, I said...

419
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,610
you did a pisspoor job
of putting it together.

420
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,990
First of all, you got the flow system
all reversed. Let me guess.

421
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,710
- You've been tearin' up rotors
and you can't figure out why.
- Yeah, that's right.

422
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,380
Well, that's because
your cams are all wrong, Mr Wizard.

423
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,710
Who's been operating this thing?

424
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,130
- Right there.
- We've actually--

425
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,800
- We've had them training
for eight months solid now.
- Eight whole months?

426
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,390
- Well, pretty much, yeah.
- Well, gee whiz.

427
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,840
Well, this is the team
that has to do the job up there.

428
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,970
We need you to train them down here.

429
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,810
Well, Mr Stamper, what do you think ?

430
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,070
You know, drilling's a science.
It's an art.

431
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,320
I'm a third generation driller,
doin' it all my life.

432
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,650
I still haven't got it all figured out.

433
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,030
I assume you sent for me because
somebody told you I was the best.

434
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,000
Well, I'm only the best
because I work with the best.

435
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,990
You don't trust the men you're working
with, you're as good as dead.

436
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,250
Now you wanna send
these boys into space, fine.

437
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,250
I'm sure they'll make good astronauts,

438
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,050
but they don't know jack about drillin'.

439
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,880
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?

440
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,170
Your backup plan. You gotta have
some kind of backup plan, right?

441
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,170
No, we don't have a backup plan.

442
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,180
- This is it.
- This is the best that you could--

443
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,680
that the government--
the U.S. government can come up with.

444
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,020
I mean, you're NASA for cryin' out loud.
You put a man on the moon.

445
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,400
You're geniuses.
You're the guys that think this shit up.

446
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,020
I'm sure you got a team of men
sittin' around somewhere right now,

447
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,490
just thinkin' shit up
and somebody backin' them up.

448
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,240
You tell me you don't have
a backup plan, that these
eight Boy Scouts right here,

449
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,780
- that is the world's hope,
that's what you're tellin' me?
- Yeah.

450
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,540
Oh, Jesus. Damn it.

451
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,160
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?

452
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,590
- All they gotta do is drill?
- That's it.

453
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,060
- No spacewalkin',
no crazy astronaut stuff.
- Just drill.

454
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,100
How many men were you
plannin' on takin' up there?

455
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,270
We're sendin' up
two shuttles, two teams.

456
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,720
If I do this,
I'm gonna wanna take my own men.

457
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,310
You got it.

458
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,400
- So you're saying you'll help us?
- Yes, sir.

459
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,570
Thanks.

460
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,490
I just don't trust
anybody else to do it, that's all.

461
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,960
- [ Siren Wailing ]
- No, Mrs Curlene.

462
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,750
It's Harry Stamper. You see Bear,
you tell him Harry's lookin' for him.

463
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,430
Those guys get off this rig,
they scatter.

464
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,430
J. Otis Curlene Bear.

465
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,260
Probably the only black man
on a big hog in Kadoka, South Dakota.

466
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,850
Come and get Papa Bear!

467
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,190
- Uh, Max.
- You got a weight limit on the shuttle?

468
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,950
- Max.
- Hey, Mama.

469
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,110
So sweet, Maxie.

470
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,580
Hey, would you give me one of them
yellow jelly bear claws I like?

471
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,450
- Are you in trouble with the law again?
- No, Mama.

472
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,950
- Maxie.
- I swear, Mama. I'm--

473
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,120
- You know I want Rockhound.
- We call him Hound because,
well, he's horny.

474
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,550
[ Grace ] You might wanna start

with the mental and physical
rigors of working in space...

with the Air Force.

are leaving for launch prep in Florida.

So we're going swimming on
this asteroid. Is that what this is for?

this monster "Armadillo."

Neil Armstrong, 1969,
bouncing on the moon.

687
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,510
He's bouncing up there because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

688
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,470
This will be similar
to the asteroid, so watch it.

689

Something gets launched
off that asteroid with enough force,

690
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,930
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

Yeah.

Now let's keep the laughter to
a minimum. I know this is not to scale.

709
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,710
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

710
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,300
Now 67 minutes later,

711
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:26,180
you're gonna dock with the Russian space
station to meet cosmonaut Andropov...

712
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,310
who will refuel the shuttles
with liquid O2.

713
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,970
That's your fuel.
Then you'll release...

714
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,860
and take a 60-hour trip
toward the moon.

715
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,150
Now we only have one shot
of landing on this rock,

716
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,660
and that's precisely when
the asteroid passes by the moon.

717
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,660
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters,

718
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,160
slingshotting you around the moon,

719
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,670

720
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,010
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, I remember this one.

721

It's where the coyote sat
his ass down in a slingshot...

to an Acme rocket.

- Rockhound.

will be cleared by the moon's gravity.

And you'll land right here.
That's it.

some gravity. You can walk around,

You do that, and the remaining
pieces of rock...

to pass right by us.
