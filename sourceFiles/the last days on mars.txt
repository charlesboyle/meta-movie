1
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,019
First big one of the season.

2
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,115
Yep.
It's heading right for base.

3
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,694
It's gonna mess up Kim's dig.

4
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,826
She's not gonna like that.

5
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,733
Yeah, well, I don't
like it much either.

6
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,736
There's a surprise.

7
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,570
Lighten up, Vince,
a bit of dust never hurt anyone.

8
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,205
It's not the dust
I'm worried about.

9
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,552
- Harrington, you seeing this?
- Yeah, it's a beast.

10
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,249
Cycle down the backup grids
in case we lose anything.

11
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,939
We'll be back as soon as we pick up Kim.

12
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,080
Campbell to Aldrich.

13
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,754
Campbell to Aldrich.

14
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,133
Campbell to Aldrich.
Come in, Kim.

15
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,135
It's 15:30, Kim.

16
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,508
Come on, Kim, time to wrap it up.

17
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,144
Fuck off.

18
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,022
Actually, I'd be happy to, Kim.

19
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,028
Unfortunately, Brunel
wants you back at the briefing.

20
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:22,066
Well, he'll have to wait,
won't he?

21
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,339
Ten things about Mars you won't
miss when you're back on Earth.

22
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,841
Only ten?

23
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,844
Uh... storms.

24
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,846
Your driving.

25
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,972
Kim.

26
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,681
Kim.

27
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,548
Kim.

28
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,258
A six-month commute home
in a floating coffin. With Kim.

29
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,090
Is that ten?
I've lost count already.

30
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,186
It's not a coffin, Vince.

31
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,825
But that's an interesting
choice of words.

32
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,203
Okay. A nice big spaceship.
What do you want me to say?

33
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,676
We get out
and walk at the end.

34
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,738
On green grass.
Under blue skies.

35
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,184
Yeah.

36
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,519
Green grass. Blue skies.

37
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:25,061
Blue skies around the corner

38
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,224
Everything's gonna be right

39
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:32,759
Never a cloud
in those bright blue skies

40
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,239
Running late, Kim.

41
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,244
Don't worry, I'll take the heat.

42
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,403
Did you get all the
samples you wanted?

43
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:45,109
Does it matter?
We're still going back empty-handed.

44
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,947
Come on, Kim. That's not fair.
We've achieved a lot here.

45
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,817
Yeah, like what?

46
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,791
As far as I'm concerned, we're just
sharpening pencils for the next crew.

47
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,760
Whoever remembered the second man
on the moon anyway?

48
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,262
It was Buzz Aldrin.

49
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,230
Yeah, first man
to piss on the moon.

50
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,289
What?

51
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,300
He pissed himself on the moon.
You didn't know that?

52
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,904
Well, that's something for us all
to aspire to, isn't it?

53
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,768
I just don't want to go
home with nothing.

54
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,504
- Six months isn't enough time.
- You could always stay.

55
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,843
Vincent, why don't you just go...

56
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,077
Let's go.

57
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,347
Rover One, where are you?
We've got circuits failing all over.

58
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,347
Sorry. Got held up.
On our way.

59
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,179
All right, but we
need you back here.

60
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,777
We've lost our link to the Aurora
and Harrington can't handle it alone.

61
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,983
Where's Vincent?
I wanna talk to my daughter.

62
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,356
On his way, I hope.

63
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:07,296
Six months cruising and now this.
Bit of a mess.

64
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,335
Be all right. We're in the home
stretch. One more day.

65
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,538
Hey. When you wake up,

66
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,011
I'd love to know how long it'll
be before skylink's restored.

67
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,810
Sorry. Uh...

68
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,814
Yeah, nearly there.

69
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,186
Ah, yeah. This should be it.
Here we go.

70
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,748
We've lost your signal,
do you copy?

71
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,260
Sorry, guys. We had a power
outage due to the storm.

72
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,854
We can see it from Sat Four.
You had us worried for a minute.

73
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,027
All right, time check: final approach
burn in 19 hours, 56 minutes.

74
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,593
Copy that. Safe orbit.

75
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,230
Be great to see you guys again.
Brunel out.

76
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,869
- For fuck's sake.
- Jesus, no.

77
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,376
All right.

78
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,538
Manual check everything.
All systems.

79
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,956
What are you so happy about?

80
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,285
Vince, tell me you're close by.

81
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:12,763
We're on our own until you get
these systems back online.

82
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,422
Roger that.
Almost there.

83
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,297
Keep losing charge on this thing.
Don't want to push it too hard.

84
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,564
Roger that, Vince.

85
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,698
I need a word.

86
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,140
All right. Okay.

87
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,114
- I need to go back out again.
- Forget it.

88
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,746
We've got a briefing.
We need everyone on base.

89
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:39,916
What's going on?

90
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,152
Gamma sensor on Site Nine
isn't responding.

91
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,819
Storm damage, possibly.
I don't know.

92
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,091
You didn't check it
before you came back?

93
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,828
What do you want me to say?
I'm a fucking idiot? I'm sorry.

94
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,270
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
The sun's about to go down.

95
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,104
I signed off on this site.
I'll be quick.

96
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,972
It's going to look bad,
really bad for everybody

97
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,138
if the relief crew
has to come out and fix it.

98
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,943
A lot of things
need fixing around here.

99
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,177
You'll have Vincent in no time.

100
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,856
Take Harrington.

101
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,759
And make sure you're back
before dark. Is that clear?

102
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,853
Thank you.

103
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,955
I want everybody cleaned up
before we do our final briefing.

104
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,262
You know I don't fuck around.

105
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,198
Harrington, let's go.
Rover number two, now.

106
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,811
Sir, you want us to go outside?

107
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,781
Just make sure you're back
before dark.

108
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,831
- Are you all right?
- Huh?

109
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,423
Yeah. Yeah.

110
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,033
Listen.

111
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,537
Never get sick of that sound.

112
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,506
- Where are you guys going?
- Soak up some more radiation.

113
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,742
Try making babies
after this mission, huh?

114
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,874
- Too funny.
- Well, I'm laughing.

115
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,419
- What the hell are you doing?
- Harry...

116
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,614
If that cooling system's down,
I'm gonna need your help back there.

117
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,352
Sorry, man. You're gonna have to
speak to Brunel. It's not my call.

118
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,096
We bust our asses to get back here

119
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,797
and those pricks get to
fucking go out again.

120
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:14,039
Nineteen hours.
It's just 19 hours.

121
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,910
So what do you know
about cooling systems?

122
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,741
So what's the score?

123
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,812
Marko Petrovic one, Kim nil.

124
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,585
- What?
- Never mind.

125
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,752
We're fixing a broken sensor.

126
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,495
Did you hear?

127
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,764
Right. So are we gonna be long?

128
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,998
Well, it takes as long as it takes.

129
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,564
Oh, come on, man.
Brunel's not gonna like this.

130
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:49,102
You want to speed things up, Harry,
go prep the sample boxes then, okay?

131
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,342
Date, grid reference,
and new prefix. MA-1.

132
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,744
MA-1?

133
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,153
Microscopic anomaly.

134
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:09,493
- Hold on. Does Brunel know?
- Just trust me on this one, okay?

135
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,513
Are you cosy in there?

136
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,605
Like a bug in a rug.

137
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,886
- You talk to Ella?
- No, I missed the window.

138
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,123
Shit, man. I'm sorry about that.

139
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:42,155
I got... you know, delayed.

140
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,360
- Kim.
- Yeah.

141
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,370
Never mind. I'll get
another chance back on Aurora.

142
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,872
Hey, I come bearing gifts.
You want some?

143
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,186
- Jesus Christ.
- What's up?

144
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,246
Half the C02 scrubbers
are down on the Aurora.

145
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,019
Check out this approach trajectory.

146
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,358
These guys are gonna get
pulled over for drunk driving.

147
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,617
Can't we at least get on board

148
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,895
before you start worrying
about the Aurora?

149
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,093
Aren't you excited to go home?

150
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,693
Home isn't the issue.

151
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,932
It's the six months it takes
to get there

152
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,271
strapped to the back of
a nuclear warhead I'm worried about.

153
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,012
- What?
- Are you all right?

154
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,409
Come on, Irwin.

155
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,420
Can we please not do
the whole analysis thing right now?

156
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,683
- I got a lot of work to do.
- You know how it is.

157
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,282
You're not happy if things
aren't working.

158
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,383
I'm not happy if you're not happy.

159
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,761
I'm happy. I'm ecstatic. See?

160
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:51,597
- Okay. All right.
- See? Happy, happy, happy.

161
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,728
All right, we're happy.

162
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,465
Uh-oh.
Get the popcorn out.

163
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,771
Who's your money on?

164
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,408
Are you kidding me?
Kim. Every time.

165
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,478
She's got a point, though.
How come Marko gets a free pass?

166
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,330
So, what do you reckon?

167
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:37,275
We all go back home, find God,

168
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,283
write a poem about it
like the moon walkers did?

169
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,843
It did change them.
They all said so.

170
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,616
People don't really change.

171
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,682
Put them under enough pressure,
you find out who they really are.

172
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,194
God, that is deep.
Are you gonna put that in a poem?

173
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,206
That was uncomfortable.

174
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,171
What's she doing?

175
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,480
Kim, that's Marko's workstation.

176
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,491
I just wanna know
what's so urgent.

177
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,290
You can't go through his private log.
Come on, Vincent, tell her!

178
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,560
Oh, yeah.
Like she's gonna listen to me.

179
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,191
- This is bullshit.
- Kim, she's right.

180
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,463
Just 'cause he broke the rules,
it doesn't make it fair game.

181
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:37,064
There's no way Marko gives a shit
about a broken sensor, okay?

182
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,723
I just want to know why his research
is more important than mine.

183
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,409
What?

184
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,916
That's definitely
not what it looks like.

185
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,387
Those cavities in the rock...
those could be microbial borings.

186
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,048
PAH's can be formed
non-organically.

187
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,093
- Sample still under the scope?
- I'll check.

188
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,561
All right, anyone want to tell me
what's going on?

189
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,859
Nothing's going on.

190
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:05,232
He found a piece of
abiotic mineral. Bullshit.

191
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,576
Got it.

192
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,944
Holy shit.

193
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,789
- That looks like...
- New cell division.

194
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,618
Bacterial cell division.

195
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,735
I want that site locked down.
No one goes near.

196
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,431
We'll upload the scans and
data to Mission Control,

197
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,268
see if they confirm
Lane's conclusions.

198
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,070
We need to speak to
Marko first. It's his find.

199
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,409
He's the one who's been playing silly
games. Why didn't he talk to us?

200
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,539
Because that would
be sharing the credit.

201
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,140
That's not fair.

202
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,446
I think we're missing the point.

203
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,111
This is what we came here for,
isn't it?

204
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,917
- Don't you think we ought to check it out?
- He knows what he's doing.

205
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,118
So, we're going to entrust
the greatest find in human history

206
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,888
to a man who just lied to you?
Is that it?

207
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,640
Rover Two, this is base.
You at Site Nine yet?

208
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,970
Yeah, we, um... We got here
a couple of minutes ago.

209
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,100
What's up, sir?

210
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:25,616
I'm declaring the site
off limits. Put Marko on now.

211
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,082
Yep. Stand by, base.

212
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,144
Marko, I've got Brunel on comms.
Are you copying any of this?

213
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,245
That's negative.

214
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,453
Can you speak in English
please, mate?

215
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,960
Tell them the signal
is breaking up.

216
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,091
Tell them you can't see me now.
Tell...

217
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,635
I've got Brunel
holding on the other line.

218
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,474
Don't argue with me now.

219
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,014
Just come out and bring
the camera with you.

220
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:01,984
You have to see this, Harry.
It's beautiful.

221
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,279
Harry! Harry! Help!

222
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,618
Marko!

223
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,318
Come on!

224
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,627
Oh, my God.

225
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,378
Mayday!
This is Harrington to base.

226
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:32,745
I need help here.
Repeat, mayday! Please help.

227
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,508
- What happened?
- He's gone.

228
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,605
Have you been down there to him?

229
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,411
Why aren't you down there,
Harrington?

230
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,253
- I tried.
- Well, you didn't try hard enough.

231
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,254
- I'm gonna go down there myself!
- No, Dalby.

232
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,915
- He could still be alive!
- You'll rip your suit,

233
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,517
- or break your neck.
- I haven't pronounced it yet.

234
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,587
I'm pronouncing it, Dalby.
He's dead.

235
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,290
I'm not gonna risk another life,
so stand down.

236
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,562
People are pulled from frozen water
all the time and revived.

237
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,069
You don't know he's dead!
You don't know!

238
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,696
Dalby, stand down.

239
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,565
Stand down.

240
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,287
He said he'd found something, sir.

241
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,102
Nobody goes down there
until we've got the right gear.

242
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,604
We've gotta run this
by Mission Control.

243
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,077
How long will it take?

244
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,605
Altogether, 30 to 40 minutes.

245
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,118
Sir. Uh...

246
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,956
I really wanna stay here.
We can't just leave him like this.

247
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,460
No. I need to do it.
You've done enough.

248
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,294
You're not gonna do
anything stupid, are you?

249
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,099
You're not gonna go in that pit.
Is that clear?

250
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:39,769
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

251
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,136
All right.

252
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,475
Okay.

253
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,479
This is Brunel.

254
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:54,787
Contact Mission Control.
We've had an accident.

255
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,676
- Did you see him?
- No.

256
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,236
Look, skipper, if there's
any chance he's alive,

257
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,714
- we need to get back out there.
- No.

258
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,684
There's no way he survived that fall
without compromising his suit.

259
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,297
Load up the lifting gear.
We'll pull him out

260
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,848
as soon as we hear back
from Mission Control.

261
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,654
Got it.

262
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,598
So when are we planning on
announcing the discovery?

263
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,261
You really are something else
aren't you, Kim?

264
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,000
Hasn't it sunken in yet?
This discovery changes everything.

265
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,009
Takes precedence
over everything, right?

266
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,373
What about human decency?

267
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,744
So I'm the bad guy now
for staying focused on the mission?

268
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,213
I didn't get him killed.

269
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,743
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

270
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,344
What the fuck are you
trying to say there, Kim?

271
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,583
You broke with protocol.
Figure it out.

272
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,387
- You are fucking...
- Hey, hey, hey.

273
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,360
You are unbelievable!

274
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,954
- What's the matter with you?
- Fucking laugh at me.

275
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,694
- Okay, enough. Away.
- Okay.

276
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,738
Nothing wrong with me. I'm not
the one breaking the rules.

277
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,535
- That's not helpful, Kim.
- Just drop it.

278
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,132
Cheers, Kim.

279
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,772
He's falling apart.
Like everything else around here.

280
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,745
All right. That's enough.

281
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,283
Am I the only one
who's noticed this?

282
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,956
Base from Mission Control,
responding your priority code 13.

283
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:39,223
What can we say, guys?
We're all in deep shock.

284
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,959
Marko's family has been
informed of the situation,

285
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:45,659
but we haven't gone public yet
until you confirm his status.

286
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,827
The board are working
on an official statement,

287
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:50,568
but they'll be looking for you
to put a few words together

288
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:54,509
if it comes down to that.
Brunel, we copy your safety concerns,

289
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,241
but it's a go for retrieving
Petrovic. Use all caution.

290
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,774
Rough way to end the mission, guys,
but we're behind you 100 percent.

291
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,980
More soon.
16:36, message ends.

292
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,122
You heard him.
We'll retrieve the body,

293
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,321
then announce Marko's discovery.
Let's go.

294
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,865
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

295
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,436
Sir, can, um...

296
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,843
Can I have a quiet word, please?

297
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,380
Yeah.

298
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,517
Skipper, I know it's not my place,

299
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,280
but you can't let Kim
behave like that.

300
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,380
Nor anyone else, okay?

301
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,161
Look, I know it's bad,
but we all knew the risks.

302
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,289
Honestly, it's a miracle an accident
hasn't happened up here sooner.

303
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,061
I'm still the one
who let him go out.

304
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,657
No. No, I'm sorry,

305
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,295
with all due respect to Marko,
he brought this on himself.

306
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,308
Any screw-up by anyone on this team,
that's my responsibility.

307
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,978
It's not fair to take Harrington
back out.

308
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,152
He stays here with Kim.

309
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,345
- All right.
- Okay.

310
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,941
Sir, you're breaking up.
Repeat your message.

311
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,107
Rover One all loaded up.
Heading back to you.

312
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:51,112
How are you holding up out there?

313
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,450
Dalby?

314
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,358
Sorry, for a second, I...

315
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,361
What is it, Dalby?

316
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,100
Dalby?

317
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,371
Somebody's coming in.

318
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,136
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

319
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,369
Dalby?

320
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,613
Dalby?

321
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,236
Dalby. Come in, Dalby.
Where the hell is she?

322
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,806
We've had static
at Site Nine all day.

323
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,136
Maybe the comms are down again.

324
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,677
Still doesn't
explain her last response.

325
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,919
Lane, Irwin, check Rover Two.

326
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,565
Jeez, it's still
venting steam.

327
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,438
Must be a lot of water
down there.

328
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:24,176
If she went down there
after I told her not to...

329
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,580
Dalby. Come in, Dalby.

330
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,914
Please respond.

331
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,552
Please respond.

332
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,054
There's nothing in Rover Two.

333
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,687
She wouldn't disobey an order.

334
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,025
Maybe she fell in.

335
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:45,432
Can't see the bottom.
How deep do you think it is?

336
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,367
I don't like this one bit.

337
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,934
All right, Vince. Strap up.
Let's see what's down there.

338
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,766
Yes, sir.

339
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,213
Gets a little tight
down there, doesn't it?

340
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,890
All right.

341
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,393
Here we go.

342
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,808
All right.

343
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,506
Jesus.

344
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,415
You all right down there?

345
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:40,013
Oh, yeah. Never better.

346
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:46,694
It's, uh, nice.
A walk in the park.

347
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,033
Jesus Christ.

348
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,097
Okay.

349
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,375
Mark me off!

350
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,853
Holy shit.

351
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,821
What? What do you see?

352
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,389
I don't know. It's, uh...

353
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,965
In the rock formations, there's...
something growing on them.

354
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,025
Like, uh...

355
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,965
I don't know what it is, but...

356
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,872
It's definitely alive.

357
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,835
We should bring him up.

358
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,075
I'm gonna try and get a little lower.
See if I can find Marko.

359
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,311
- Take me down.
- You got it, Vince.

360
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,428
Fuck!

361
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,434
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
- Vincent.

362
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,977
Bring him up. Bring him up.
Bring him up!

363
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,744
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

364
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,750
Vince, are you all right?
Just breathe.

365
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,623
We gotcha.
Come on. That's it.

366
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,157
- All right.
- Vincent...

367
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,062
OK, OK, OK.

368
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,123
You're all right.

369
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,898
Vincent, what did you see?
Vincent?

370
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,439
Vincent!

371
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,675
I'm OK.

372
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,405
I'm OK.

373
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,470
What the hell happened down there?

374
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:23,350
Nothing. I'm good.

375
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:30,991
I saw the bottom.
They're not there.

376
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,790
Skipper, it's Irwin.

377
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,299
There's footprints here.
There's two pairs.

378
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,859
What?

379
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,303
Where are they headed?

380
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,671
They're crossing the rift valley.

381
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,775
They look like they're headed
back towards base.

382
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:53,976
If she pulled him out of there,
why didn't they just take the rover?

383
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,448
This just doesn't make sense.

384
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:04,660
Call Kim. Tell her to prepare
for one, maybe two casualties.

385
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,132
He'll be in a bad way
if he's been exposed.

386
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:14,728
Possible brain damage from
oxygen deprivation, hypoxia...

387
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,828
That's if we're lucky.

388
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,743
- Look, what I said earlier...
- Shut up, Kim. Shut up.

389
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,369
Let's just forget it, yeah?

390
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,812
They're about 50 meters out.

391
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,980
Must be Marko and Dalby, but...

392
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,580
What the hell?
They walked all the way back?

393
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,184
As long as they're OK,
that's all that counts, right?

394
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,890
Base to Dalby,
can you come in, please?

395
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:44,661
They're coming around to the airlock.
I'm gonna go let them in.

396
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:47,602
Wait. We haven't
established comms here.

397
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,720
Marko! Oh, fuck.

398
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,453
You're okay, you're okay.

399
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,624
Oh, fuck!

400
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,077
Marko, what the fuck
are you doing? Marko!

401
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,438
Go!

402
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,156
Base, this is Brunel.
Come in, please.

403
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,152
Come in, please. Base.

404
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,489
Mayday! mayday!

405
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,892
Harrington?

406
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,692
Harrington, please respond.

407
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,391
Lane, Irwin, check the other side.

408
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,249
- Call me if you see anything.
- Okay.

409
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,463
Harrington.
Come in, Harrington.

410
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,647
- Stay out here.
- I'm fine, I'm coming with you.

411
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,733
Stay on comms.
I'll call you if I need you.

412
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,310
Look Skipper, I know
I was a little shaky back there.

413
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,711
That's an order.
Don't argue with me.

414
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,196
Explain to me what
the hell's going on here.

415
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,373
What the fuck.

416
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,239
We need to quarantine them here.

417
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,108
Get in a suit. I'll buy you time.
Go, go, go.

418
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,976
I'm right behind you.

419
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,921
Listen to me.
Marko, you're sick.

420
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,824
I want to help you.
Can you understand me?

421
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,624
I want to help you.

422
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,327
Vincent, Lane, I'm in the airlock.
I'm coming out.

423
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:43,236
- What happened in there?
- They're killing us!

424
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,005
Kim?
What happened in there?

425
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,627
Are you all right?
What happened?

426
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:08,186
- Just breathe.
- Marko and Dalby are dead.

427
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,028
They couldn't have survived it.
But they're still moving.

428
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,362
She's not making sense.

429
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,664
If they're moving,
they've got brain function.

430
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,799
If they've got brain function
they're not dead, Kim.

431
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,933
I'm not a fucking idiot!
I know.

432
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,601
The airlock.

433
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,310
It's Brunel.

434
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,818
Lock the door!
Lock the door! Fuck!

435
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,114
Seal it up.
Don't let them get out!

436
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:33,884
- He's bleeding.
- Need to seal it.

437
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,516
He's got a tear!
He's bleeding.

438
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,222
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- You're okay.

439
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,898
Yeah, I've got it.

440
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,303
- What's Kim doing? She's...
- Kim!

441
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,638
What the hell are you doing?

442
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,907
Kim!
No, that's the door lock!

443
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,346
Kim, stop!
No, they're still in there!

444
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:01,850
Get off me. Get off me!

445
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,386
It's okay. You disabled it.
They can't get out.

446
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,978
You don't know what they did!
Look for yourself!

447
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,600
Vincent?

448
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,738
What happened to them?
What the hell happened to them?

449
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,935
It's low pressure.
They've got the bends.

450
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,377
When are you guys gonna get it?
It's not them anymore! They're gone!

451
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:34,781
Fuck!

452
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,581
That door is reinforced steel.
They can't get through.

453
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,417
They have power tools. They have
high explosives! They can get out!

454
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,631
If they drill the door
the decompression'll kill them.

455
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,591
- It won't.
- Brunel's in a bad way.

456
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,185
- We need to move him now.
- Fuck.

457
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,890
Let's get him
to the hydroponic dome.

458
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,730
Kim, get the airlock.
Let's go. Now!

459
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,464
- We're gonna move you now.
- We've gotta go now! Move!

460
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,131
- Come on, skipper, let's go.
- One, two, three.

461
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,436
Oh, shit!

462
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,807
Just a little bit.

463
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:08,081
Almost there. Come on.

464
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,449
- Come on, you can do it.
- You're nearly there.

465
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,934
- Have you got him?
- Yeah.

466
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,491
Gently, gently.

467
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,662
- Irwin, get out the way.
- Okay, okay.

468
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,831
- Sit him up.
- I'm trying.

469
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,935
- Careful.
- It's all right.

470
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,852
Okay. One, two, three.
Mind his neck.

471
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,015
- It's okay.
- Gently, gently.

472
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,252
There you go.

473
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,360
Captain, stay awake
and focus, okay?

474
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,528
Okay. It's just that...
Nothing feels right inside.

475
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,663
- I'm gonna give you a shot.
- Doesn't feel right.

476
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,934
Gonna give you
some morphine, okay?

477
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:07,874
Here we go.

478
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,049
All right.
We've got to get this open.

479
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,859
- Jeez.
- Oh, God.

480
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,558
Vincent, I'm not a medic.
I can't do this.

481
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,829
Lane, if anyone can do this, you can.
Just tell me what you need.

482
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,371
Come on.

483
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:41,001
Hey, I know that look.
You don't have to...

484
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,808
Oh, God.

485
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,643
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

486
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,415
There should be more blood.

487
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:56,716
Six months. What a mess.
I thought we were home free.

488
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:04,033
What's Kate gonna tell the kids?

489
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,192
Shh.

490
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:10,433
I can't... I can't remember
what they look like.

491
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,432
You tell them I was thinking
about them. Do that for me?

492
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,379
I will. Of course.
Of course I will.

493
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:28,947
We've seen things
that no one has seen before.

494
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,051
They can't take that
away from us, right?

495
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,561
No.

496
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:38,958
God, I'm thirsty. Thirsty.

497
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,537
- I've got it.
- Thirsty.

498
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,798
Stay here, skipper.
Come on.

499
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,638
Just breathe.

500
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,736
Nice and easy.
You're gonna be okay.

501
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,777
Okay.

502
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:02,619
Okay. It's okay, it's me.
It's Irwin. It's okay.

503
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,887
Okay, careful. Careful.

504
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,826
Get some more. Kim, get some more.
Okay. Hey, I'm with you.

505
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,097
You have to... You have to...

506
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,072
You gotta help me.
You gotta help.

507
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,166
No! Stop!

508
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,244
- Skipper, no! Let go!
- Jesus!

509
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,281
Get off him!
Skipper! Stop! No!

510
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:33,686
Look at me! Look at me!

511
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:38,852
You're okay, you're okay. Come on.
Goddamn it! Stop, please!

512
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,021
Please. Just look at me.

513
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,599
It's okay. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

514
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,997
Come on, come on, come on.

515
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,832
Look at me. Look at me, come on.
Please. Come on.

516
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,099
Just breathe. You're okay.

517
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:52,368
Skipper.

518
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,011
You'll never see home.

519
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,162
What the fuck was that?

520
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,007
He didn't mean that.
He couldn't. He couldn't.

521
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,556
Kim.

522
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:50,326
- Kim, he's gone.
- Don't touch me.

523
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,425
What the hell are you doing?

524
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,936
You think he's dead, right?

525
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:59,770
Vincent... Kim, he's gone.

526
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,673
Kim.

527
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,178
Get your hands off him.
Get away from him!

528
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,340
- He has gone.
- Think about it, Irwin.

529
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,714
Marko and Dalby are out there
exposed to the atmosphere

530
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:11,913
- and they're still moving.
- It can't be how it looks.

531
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,250
There must be
some explanation for this.

532
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,779
I've had enough of this place.
I just want to go home.

533
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,252
I'm done.

534
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,045
I'm done, Vincent.

535
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,821
He said he couldn't
remember his children.

536
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,161
I just want to see my little girl.

537
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,395
I wanna see Ella.

538
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,700
They've blown the dome.
They're out.

539
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,032
We need to contact the Aurora.

540
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,631
Comms are down.
Till we fix them, we're trapped.

541
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:42,177
What about the 02 feed pipe?

542
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,644
It's the only thing
connecting the two domes.

543
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:48,047
We can get back to the main base
without them even seeing us.

544
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,016
If I can get through
and fix the skylink,

545
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,144
I can reach the Aurora,
and ask for help.

546
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,554
If they've blown the dome,
it won't be pressurized.

547
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,648
There's a seal at both ends.

548
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:00,195
If I close it behind me here
and equalize the pressure,

549
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,662
it should hold when
I open the other side.

550
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,361
- If it doesn't, we're all dead.
- And what do you suggest?

551
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,959
What about Harrington?

552
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,631
When they blew the dome,
he wasn't wearing a suit.

553
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,709
Are you sure they can't get in?

554
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:21,249
How the fuck should I know?

555
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,842
The failsafe is designed
to keep the door closed.

556
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:43,067
- We need to deal with this now.
- If Harrington has gone,

557
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,937
Vincent's the only one
that can fix the skylink.

558
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,011
He's the only one.

559
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:55,680
I'm heading back.

560
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,381
- I'm going with you.
- No. There's no point.

561
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:03,186
What if Marko and Dalby
return to the base?

562
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,227
We'll keep them busy.

563
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,569
Just, uh, close this behind me

564
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,616
and leach off the air at
the other end so it doesn't blow.

565
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,167
Lane, you copy me?

566
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,171
I got you.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

567
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,175
Yeah. You keep Marko and
Dalby on your side and I'll be fine.

568
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,744
I wasn't talking about them.

569
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,302
I know.

570
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,858
Okay.

571
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,049
- Jesus, is that...
- Same as Marko's sample.

572
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,952
It's infected his bloodstream.

573
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,552
Lane... Lane!

574
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,722
No, stop. No...

575
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,229
It's okay.

576
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:58,358
- You're having another attack.
- I can't...

577
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,631
Can you hear me?
Vincent.

578
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,706
What happened on the Aurora,
what happened on the way over here,

579
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,400
it's in the past, all right?

580
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:12,111
- I can't... I can't do it.
- You can do this, okay?

581
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:15,308
I have seen you build a comm system
out of a fucking shaving kit,

582
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,114
so don't tell me
you can't handle this.

583
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:25,159
They're supposed to
test us for this shit.

584
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,421
Weed out people like me.

585
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:29,293
You think the rest of us aren't
on the verge of coming unstuck?

586
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:33,630
Was Marko acting rationally in
the last few days? Was anyone?

587
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,067
You were.

588
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,743
If you think I'm handling this
better, then I'm worried about you.

589
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,781
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm barely holding it together.

590
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:49,811
Vincent.

591
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:56,484
No matter how tight it gets
in there, I will be with you.

592
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,694
I know. Thanks.

593
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,715
Lane, you still there?

594
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,749
Yeah, I'm here.
Are you at the base?

595
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:07,556
Yeah.

596
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:12,766
Something awful happened here.
There's blood everywhere.

597
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,598
We'll try and keep
Marko and Dalby busy.

598
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,435
We're looking for something
to immobilize them with.

599
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,772
OK. I'm gonna try
and get some power up.

600
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,039
Might take a while.
I'll keep you posted.

601
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:48,068
- It can't be that simple.
- What can't?

602
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:49,729
Well, it's a bacteria, isn't it?

603
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:52,069
We've got a whole range
of antibiotics here.

604
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,632
We've got tetracycline,
cephalosporin,

605
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,302
erythromycin, penicillin.

606
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,573
And if they do work,
how do we deliver them?

607
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,836
They're not just gonna stand there
while we inject them.

608
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,475
Decontamination spray,
in the airlock.

609
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,781
We atomize it in a contained space.

610
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,787
We need to find a way to test it.

611
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:28,831
Come on. Come on, baby.

612
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,850
Okay, we've got something.

613
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:52,325
Blood sample 12 is reacting
to the cephalosporin.

614
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,694
Are we gonna do this or not?

615
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,079
Better hold him steady. Irwin?

616
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,016
Get over here.
For fuck's sake, Irwin.

617
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:22,512
Hold his head.

618
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,724
No pulse. Here goes.

619
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,277
- Captain...
- It's just a reflex.

620
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:51,717
- Maybe he's trying to fight it.
- Brunel's gone, okay?

621
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:52,947
He's not here anymore.

622
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,568
Fixed and dilated.

623
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,572
Let's test his blood again.

624
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,581
No multiplication.
Almost zero motility.

625
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,953
You sure this
is gonna work as a vapor?

626
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,788
It works intravenously,
so it has to.

627
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:39,666
Tantalus base to Aurora.
Do you copy, Aurora?

628
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,364
Tantalus base to Aurora. Mayday,
mayday. Do you copy, Aurora?

629
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:48,167
This is Aurora,
we copy your mayday.

630
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:50,304
Christ, you don't know how
good you guys sound.

631
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,643
We've got an emergency
down here. We need...

632
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,649
What the...?

633
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,811
No, no, no, no, no.

634
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,455
Oh, shit.

635
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:11,489
They've just given up.
Kim, they're leaving!

636
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:13,660
They're heading back to base.
I can't see them.

637
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,199
We've got to get them in here, now!

638
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,503
Oh, please. Kim, Kim.

639
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,779
Get a syringe.

640
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,782
Fuck. Where's Marko?

641
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,410
Irwin, get a syringe.

642
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,114
- Just wait.
- What?

643
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,024
The bacteria's
developing a resistance.

644
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,529
The effect's only temporary.

645
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:04,177
No, no!

646
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,669
Down! Down! Stay down!

647
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:40,143
Oh, for fuck's sake.

648
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,224
Lane, Harrington's
right behind me!

649
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,491
I couldn't seal the tunnel.
Open the panel!

650
01:00:57,554 --> 01:00:59,693
He's in the tunnel.
Harrington's after him.

651
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,232
He hasn't sealed the other end.
Get your helmets on.

652
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,243
Open the panel!

653
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,878
- Okay?
- Go, go.

654
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,484
Open the fucking panel!

655
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:26,353
Vince! Vincent!

656
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,891
Help! Ah!

657
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:53,711
Move, move!

658
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:57,222
Get out of here. We'll follow.

659
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:13,103
- Why won't it open?
- Failsafe is set to lock

660
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,802
in case of a breach.
I have to reboot it to get it open.

661
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,964
Please.

662
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,674
Irwin. Where's Kim?

663
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,185
She didn't make it.

664
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:17,503
Rover One!
Go! Now! Go! Go!

665
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:21,642
Go!

666
01:03:30,674 --> 01:03:32,881
Don't try and pull it out.
Your suit's breached.

667
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,455
- Come on.
- Hurry up!

668
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:38,152
We need to get to the landing site,
wait for Aurora. Irwin, you drive.

669
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:43,157
- Shit.
- Drive. Just drive.

670
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,886
We need the med unit at base.

671
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,224
Dream on.

672
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,925
We don't have the kit here
to close that up.

673
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:22,492
And you think they'll just
sit there and let you do that?

674
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,005
What is it, ten hours
till the lander gets here?

675
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,268
How long have we
got in this thing?

676
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,277
Irwin, I need power and 02 levels.

677
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,937
Okay, I'm on it.

678
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,446
We'll be fine.

679
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,847
We'll hole up somewhere
and wait it out.

680
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,949
What's the point in that?

681
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:43,888
Stop the infection
before it takes hold.

682
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:46,689
Give your body a
chance to fight it.

683
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,461
Vincent.

684
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,365
I know.

685
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,068
It's okay.

686
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,572
You're gonna be okay.

687
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,256
There's not enough power
to get to the landing site.

688
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:25,129
Barely half of what we need.

689
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,428
We'd have to finish on foot.

690
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,474
No. We have to go back.

691
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:38,944
- What?
- We can't go on foot.

692
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:41,778
Lane's hurt. We go back,
we get her patched up.

693
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:44,182
We can hold 'em off.

694
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:47,483
- There are other options.
- Like what?

695
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:55,288
Look, Irwin, if you've got
something to say, just say it.

696
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:01,926
You think you should leave me behind
because I might be infected?

697
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,801
That's what you're thinking,
isn't it? Isn't it?

698
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:07,273
Lane, I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help here.

699
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,867
But you might be infected, too.

700
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,812
Brunel touched you.
Let's see your neck.

701
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:16,879
Go on, let's see it.

702
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,044
- Site Nine.
- What?

703
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,952
We've forgotten about Site Nine.
Rover Two, it's still there.

704
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,786
It's nearly fully charged.

705
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:26,225
There's enough power to make it
to the landing site.

706
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:34,160
Looks like they're
following our tracks.

707
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:35,794
Let's get going.

708
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,637
Shit!

709
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,836
Shut down the airlock
and auxiliary cabin power.

710
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,176
All right.

711
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,837
Battery's in the red.
This better work.

712
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,882
I'm gonna go check it out.

713
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:35,289
I suppose there's no point
in saying be careful.

714
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:39,299
No. I was planning on taking
a lot of unnecessary risks.

715
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:42,097
Just don't go anywhere without me.

716
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,202
No, I'll go.

717
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,603
I have some serious
making up to do.

718
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:57,042
Let me do this. Please.

719
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,071
Irwin, you copy?

720
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,511
I'm here, Vincent, I can hear.

721
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,583
Keep your eyes open.

722
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:31,585
If you see anything move,
haul ass back.

723
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,412
Okay.

724
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,725
Irwin, can you hear me?

725
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,497
You okay?

726
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,671
Come on, Irwin.
Can you power it up or not?

727
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:32,978
Talk to me, Irwin.
What's going on?

728
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:35,516
Are we on a private channel?

729
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,572
Why?

730
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:40,181
- How's Lane?
- What do you mean?

731
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:44,749
She's infected, Vince.
You need to get out of there.

732
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,418
It's not gonna happen, Irwin,
so forget about it.

733
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,929
Vincent, you're my friend.

734
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,431
But you're not thinking clearly
about this.

735
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,196
Do you think this is about me
trying to save my own skin?

736
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:57,864
I'm trying to save both of us.
It's too late for her.

737
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,497
I'll give you three seconds
to get back here.

738
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:01,200
- Just leave her!
- One.

739
01:10:01,264 --> 01:10:03,210
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- Two.

740
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:04,836
- For fuck's sake!
- Three. Shit.

741
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:09,273
Irwin's lost it.
I'm going out there.

742
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,199
Irwin! I know you can hear me!

743
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:32,239
Don't do anything stupid. Irwin!

744
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:36,135
No! Irwin! Wait!

745
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:38,979
Irwin, please, man.

746
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,140
Oh, fuck!

747
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,615
Vincent, they're coming.

748
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,162
Shit.

749
01:11:01,224 --> 01:11:03,067
We gotta get outta here. Now!

750
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:17,847
80 degrees east. Into the storm.
It'll hide our tracks.

751
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,284
We've gotta lose 'em
before the lander.

752
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:21,981
Battery power is dropping.

753
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:46,538
So they enter our
orbit in eight hours.

754
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:50,812
That is if they come down immediately
without waiting to hear from us.

755
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:54,980
- So what are our options?
- Well, wait for dawn.

756
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:57,650
The sun should charge
the battery in about an hour,

757
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:59,624
give us enough juice
to make it to the landing site.

758
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,526
And what if they track
us down before than?

759
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,292
Then we'll just have to
run them over...

760
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:09,825
and over and over
until they stop getting up.

761
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:12,065
And waste the last
of our power.

762
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,802
- That is such a shit plan, Vince.
- I know.

763
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,835
You got anything better?

764
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,678
Do you think they still feel?

765
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:32,751
No.

766
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,518
Not like us.

767
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:43,397
Oh, God. I'm so thirsty.
Do we have any water left?

768
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,529
Yeah. Let me check.

769
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:08,128
We get to the lander, they'll have
a direct line to Mission Control.

770
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:11,429
They can help.

771
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,399
And I always took you
for a pessimist.

772
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:17,802
Yeah, well, I like
to keep 'em guessing.

773
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:27,303
I keep thinking about Brunel.

774
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:32,208
I could see him fighting it.

775
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,223
I keep wondering
if he's still in there.

776
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,997
Trapped inside his own body,
with no control.

777
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,324
Sounds like hell to me.

778
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:52,434
Do you think any part of us
survives after death?

779
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:54,805
I don't know.

780
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:57,273
That's a little bit
above my pay grade.

781
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,509
Lane?

782
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:09,144
This is Aurora broadcasting
on all emergency channels.

783
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:12,516
If there is anyone out there, we're
sending an emergency team to help.

784
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:15,317
Please respond. Please respond.

785
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:18,052
This is Campbell to Aurora lander.

786
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,162
Campbell to Aurora lander.
Come in, Aurora lander.

787
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:29,703
Come on.

788
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:37,543
Lane?

789
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:41,172
Lane?

790
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:45,278
Shit.

791
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:01,299
Come on, come on.

792
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:26,454
Lane. Lane, can you hear me?

793
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:30,154
Lane, come in.

794
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:34,260
Stay back. Stay back.

795
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:41,274
No. I'm not gonna do that.
You know I can't do that.

796
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:45,779
Oh, please. I can't stop it.
I can't stop...

797
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,474
Lane, listen to me.

798
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:56,289
We'll find a way.
Okay? I promise you.

799
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:59,019
We'll find a way.
Just stop, please.

800
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,152
Please, Lane, just stop.

801
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:04,964
No. Come on.

802
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,995
Lane! Stop!

803
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,766
Wait!

804
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:17,009
Stop! Stop!

805
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:20,308
Please! Just stop.

806
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:23,213
You'll get out and walk in the end.

807
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:26,218
On green grass.
Under blue skies, won't you?

808
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,517
We will. We will.

809
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:33,458
I really wanted to, Vincent.
I really... I really did want to.

810
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:36,622
Lane, listen to me. Just wait.

811
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:40,462
- I'm so sorry.
- Just stop. Please!

812
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:42,628
I'm sorry.

813
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:43,567
No!

814
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,384
Shit! No!

815
01:17:57,473 --> 01:18:00,477
No! Lane, no.

816
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,825
No!

817
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:11,896
No, please. Please. Lane.

818
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:20,597
No.

819
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:30,750
No!

820
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,222
No!

821
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,394
Lane! Don't!

822
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:54,136
Lane! Look at me! Look at me!

823
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,039
Stop! No!

824
01:18:57,633 --> 01:19:00,409
- Stop!
- Kill me.

825
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,380
Kill me.

826
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:07,712
Kill me.

827
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:44,922
Responding to your mayday.

828
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:49,756
Approaching touchdown.
Please make contact.

829
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,957
Altitude descending.

830
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:54,661
Tantalus base,
this is Aurora.

831
01:19:58,193 --> 01:19:59,797
We have no response
from Campbell.

832
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:03,503
Six hundred. 400.

833
01:20:03,599 --> 01:20:05,670
Prepare for breach conditions.

834
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:08,874
- Shit.
- Yes, sir.

835
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,611
This is Aurora lander.
We have touchdown on Mars.

836
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:14,814
- Roger. System check.
- 29 percent fuel capacity.

837
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:18,051
All crew to prepare for exit.
Pressure checks complete.

838
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,457
Immediate ground reconnaissance.

839
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:22,291
Cabin pressure cross check.

840
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,331
Aurora lander, please respond.

841
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,332
Okay, prepare rear hatch
for exit.

842
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:30,063
Aurora lander, please respond.
Do not open your bay doors.

843
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,696
Repeat, do not open your bay doors.

844
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:37,039
We have ground contact.
Channel Nine clear for contact.

845
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,703
- Irwin, no!
- Emergency code seven.

846
01:20:39,802 --> 01:20:42,544
Stay out of there! No!

847
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,244
We have two
unidentified figures.

848
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:45,818
I'm going out to meet them.

849
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:48,248
Something isn't right here.

850
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,914
They're not responding
to our transmissions.

851
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,923
We have two
unidentified figures.

852
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,221
Go to seven, go to seven.

853
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,556
- Fuck, what the...
- Help me!

854
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:57,653
Stay back! Captain!

855
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,758
- Jesus!
- Oh, God, no! Help!

856
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,605
Oh, fuck.

857
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:20,336
Marko.

858
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:16,920
My little girl.

859
01:24:17,019 --> 01:24:21,126
I can't remember her name
anymore... to say goodbye.

860
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:24,036
Ella.

861
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,296
Her name is Ella.

862
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:40,320
I wanna feel again, Vincent.
I can't feel my hands.

863
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,719
I can't let you do this, Irwin.

864
01:24:42,778 --> 01:24:47,284
We can't let this get back
to Earth. It has to end here.

865
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,720
Aurora lander to Mission Control.

866
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:57,126
This is chief systems officer
Vincent Campbell speaking.

867
01:29:58,293 --> 01:29:59,397
Uh...

868
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:04,372
I don't know how much
you guys know but, uh...

869
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:09,939
The entire crew of Tantalus base
was infected by some sort of...

870
01:30:11,273 --> 01:30:13,275
virulent bacteria.

871
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:19,817
As far as I know, the Aurora
relief team was lost as well.

872
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:22,156
They're gone.

873
01:30:24,386 --> 01:30:26,388
All of them.

874
01:30:29,224 --> 01:30:32,137
Lander's in a stable orbit,

875
01:30:32,227 --> 01:30:35,674
but I don't have enough fuel
to reach the Aurora.

876
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:40,679
I've got the, uh, supplies on board
for Tantalus' replacement crew.

877
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:42,976
There's a chance
they might last long enough

878
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:45,745
for you to send someone
out here, but...

879
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,453
Here's the catch.

880
01:30:54,015 --> 01:30:56,017
There's a, uh...

881
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,261
pretty good chance
I'm infected, too.

882
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,802
If that's the case,

883
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:09,137
I've got just enough fuel left
to drop out of orbit

884
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:11,268
and burn up in the atmosphere.

885
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,804
At least it'll be quick.

886
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:22,812
You should get this
in about 15 minutes, so...

887
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:25,291
Uh...

888
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:32,028
I guess I'll be waiting.

889
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,695
Five eleven Zulu,
Aurora lander out.
