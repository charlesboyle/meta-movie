1
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,600
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thank you.

2
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
<i>How have you liked</i>
<i>your stay?</i>

3
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,200
What I've seen, I've liked.

4
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,000
<i>Please to explain why</i>
<i>I should agree to interview...</i>

5
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,500
with pro-Zionist
American media?

6
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Because I think
Hezbollah...

7
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,900
is trying to broaden into
a political party right now,

8
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,700
so you care about what
you're thought of in America,

9
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,700
and in America
at this moment in time,

10
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Hezbollah does not
have a face.

11
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,800
- That's why.
- Perhaps you approve
journalism objectivity,

12
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,800
and I see
the questions first.

13
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Then I decide if I grant
the interview.

14
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,200
No.
We don't do that.

15
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,600
You've seen <i>60 Minutes</i>
and Mike Wallace,

16
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,900
so you know our reputation
for integrity and objectivity.

17
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,500
You also know we are
the highest-rated, most-respected...

18
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,000
TV magazine news show
in America.

19
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,100
So, Mr. Wallace...
should he get on a plane or not?

20
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,100
<i>Tell him I'll see him</i>
<i>day after tomorrow.</i>

21
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,400
That's good.
That works.

22
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,100
You know, I want to ask you something.
I know it sounds odd, but...

23
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Hello? Sheikh?

24
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,900
Hello? Sheikh?

25
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
- Norman?
- What? What?

26
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,500
Take your blindfold off.

27
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,000
<i>Welcome to the world.</i>

28
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Fluctuating
all over the place.

29
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,500
Anywhere we shoot here, it's gonna
be portable gennies and we'll run cable.

30
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,700
- Hello?
- Mike, it's me.

31
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,500
We're on.

32
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,700
Hi, honey.

33
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,100
<i>- Hi, Daddy.</i>
- What's new?

34
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,200
- Miss Loughrey gave me a star today.
- Yeah? What for?

35
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,300
- For reading.
- That's great.

36
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,900
A little early for cartoons,
isn't it?

37
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Okay.

38
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,100
<i>Deborah? Debbie?</i>

39
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,700
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.

40
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,200
It's early,
isn't it?

41
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,400
Gotta take Debbie to ballet.

42
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,600
<i>Mommy!</i>

43
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Sweetheart, come on.
Come on.

44
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,700
<i>- She was playing</i>
<i>with my Pooh doll again.</i>

45
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,500
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
Breathe deep. Breathe deep.

46
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,600
Slow down, honey. Slow down.

47
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,500
Slow down.

48
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,700
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

49
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,300
- Deep breaths.
<i>- She was playing with the Pooh doll.</i>

50
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,600
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart.
He's dusty, and you breathed him in.

51
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,700
Okay? So, what's happening to you...
Look at me.

52
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,500
What's happening to you now
is cells called mass cells...

53
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,700
told your lungs, " Don't breathe
any more of that dust in."

54
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,200
And the airways in your lungs
are like branches,

55
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,300
and when the branches close up,
you get an asthmatic attack,

56
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,200
and we give you medicine,
and you get better.

57
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,700
Uh-huh? Okay?

58
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,600
Better already,
aren't you?

59
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,500
Okay, baby?

60
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,600
Can I go to dance tomorrow?
I-I'm better.

61
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,300
If you are, then I'll take Barbara
to soccer and take you to dance after.

62
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,900
I can take her.

63
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,500
Don't you have to
be at the office?

64
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,900
- Is there any more rice?
- Yes, it's on the stove.

65
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
<i>Do you want more rice?</i>

66
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,000
<i>- Maybe later.</i>
<i>- How about you?</i>

67
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
<i>- I'll take some.</i>
- Instant rice?

68
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
<i>Can I go over to Jeanine’s house?</i>

69
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,400
- I'm sorry, darling.
Have you seen my coffee mug?
- Try the car.

70
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,800
Um, what are
those boxes?

71
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,900
- I'm going to the store.
You need anything?
- What do you need at the store?

72
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,200
- Soy sauce.
- Right now?

73
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,100
That's my stuff
from the office.

74
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,700
Why did you take
your stuff from the office?

75
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,500
- I didn't want to leave it there.
- I don't understand.

76
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,200
I got fired
this morning.

77
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,500
Where else am I
gonna take it?

78
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,000
Why?
Who said?

79
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Thomas Sandefur.

80
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,000
What are we
supposed to do?

81
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,800
What about our medical coverage?
What about our health?

82
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,600
What about our... car payments?
The payments on this house?

83
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,400
The severance agreement
includes cash payoffs over time...

84
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,200
and continuing
medical coverage.

85
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,700
Sure you don't need anything?

86
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,100
No, thank you.

87
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,600
Jeffrey?

88
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,700
I am very pleased to receive you
as my guest, Mr. Wallace.

89
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,900
- Well, thank you for having us.
<i>- Think I got a problem with the gennie.</i>

90
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,900
I gotta go outside.

91
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,900
Give me a hand with this,
will you?

92
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Norman!

93
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,600
- He says, uh, you must not sit so close.
- What?

94
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,300
I can't conduct an interview
from back there.

95
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,400
You must move back
your chair.

96
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,300
Well, you tell him that when
I conduct an interview,

97
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,600
I sit anywhere
I damn please.

98
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,100
- There is no interview.
- You!

99
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,400
I'm talking to you! What the hell do
you think I am, a 78-year-old assassin?

100
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,700
You think I'm gonna karate him
to death with this notepad?

101
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,900
- Are you interpreting what I'm saying?
- Yes.

102
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,600
- We're there.
- Good. Well, ask him if Arabic
is his second language.

103
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,000
Don't interpret that. Hold it.

104
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,700
Hold it! Hold it!
Slow. Slow.

105
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,400
Sheikh, do you mind?

106
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,200
If you would just turn
your chair a little bit...

107
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,900
to face Mr. Wallace.

108
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,600
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

109
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you ready, or do you
wanna keep fucking around...

110
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,000
and warm up some more?

111
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,200
- No. I've got my heart started.
- Okay.

112
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,800
All right, Todd.

113
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,600
Give me the three-button
on Mike, please.

114
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Good. Good.

115
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,400
Okay, we are rolling.

116
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,500
<i>- Okay, Mike.</i>
- Sheikh Fadlallah.

117
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,600
Thank you so much for seeing us.
Are you a terrorist?

118
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,900
Mr. Wallace, I am
a servant of God.

119
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,000
A servant of God?
Really?

120
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,400
Americans believe that you...
as an Islamic fundamentalist...

121
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,200
that you are a leader who contributed
to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy.

122
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,900
Everybody thinks Canadian Mounties ride
horses and rescue ladies from rapids.

123
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,300
Mike, they backed locals
in Oka in a fight with Mohawks...

124
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,800
over building a golf course
on their burial site,

125
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,600
They beat up protesters at Kanasake...

126
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,000
- Where'd you hear that?
- Hello.

127
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,900
Oh, someone took a poll?
"Are all things Canadian boring?"

128
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,200
- It's Stuart. He's in Mexico City.
- Oh. Let me call you back.

129
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,700
Yeah, Stuart?

130
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,500
- What New York bank?
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

131
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,800
Will he go on camera and talk
about the Mexico City branch?

132
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,900
- Hey, Jake.
- Whose money are they laundering?

133
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,200
- No classes this morning?
- I don't have to be there till 10:30.

134
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,800
<i>- Hey, Mom. Hello.</i>
- Hi, sweetheart.

135
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,500
- Hello? Yeah.
- Do independent sources corroborate?

136
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,200
<i>- Dad, you got a box out here.</i>
- Let me see this a second.

137
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,900
- 'Cause I gotta know where
you're going at all times.

138
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,600
<i>I can't. I've gotta fly</i>
<i>to Boston tomorrow.</i>

139
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,900
2:00 P.M. Great.

140
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,700
- Bye-bye.
- "Ignition propensity."

141
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,100
You understand
any of this?

142
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,600
No.

143
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,700
Uh, this looks like
a table of temperatures.

144
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,400
- Who's this from?
- It's anonymous.

145
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,000
References to "P.M."

146
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's gotta be
Phillip Morris, huh?

147
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Hmm. I have to
take a shower.

148
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah?

149
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Hi. This is
Doug Oliver.

150
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,700
Oh, hi, Doug.
It's Lowell.

151
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm doing this story on fire
safety, and people burning up
from falling asleep smoking.

152
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,100
I receive a shitload of scientific
papers from inside Phillip Morris.

153
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,200
Anonymous. You or anybody
in F.D.A. Know someone...

154
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,900
who can translate this stuff
into English for me?

155
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,100
Uh, yeah.

156
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,200
- Hello?
- Uh, Mr. Wigand, please?

157
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,400
Someone's calling
for Daddy, Mom.

158
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,700
- Oh. Thank you, Bob.
- Who's calling?

159
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,100
Uh, my name
is Lowell Bergman.

160
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,800
- Did you say "Berman"?
- No, Bergman. B-E-R-G-M-A-N.

161
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,400
- I'm a producer for <i>60 Minutes.</i>
<i>- 60 Minutes?</i>

162
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
- Yeah.
<i>- 60 Minutes,</i> the television show?

163
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,900
- Yes.
- He doesn't want to talk to you.

164
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,900
How does he know he doesn't
want to talk to me? He doesn't
know what I'm calling him about.

165
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,600
He doesn't care to know.

166
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,800
<i>This is the Wigands'.</i>

167
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,400
<i>If you'd like to leave a message</i>

<i>This is Lowell Bergman with</i> 60 Minutes,
<i>and I'm doing a story...</i>

169
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,700
<i>on fire safety</i>
<i>and cigarettes.</i>

170
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,800
<i>I have scientific documents</i>
<i>from a tobacco company,</i>

171
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,600
<i>and I could use your help</i>
<i>as a consultant...</i>

172
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,600
<i>explaining these documents</i>
<i>to me.</i>

173
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,600
<i>Now, my number is</i>
<i>area code 510-555-0199.</i>

174
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,400
<i>I'll be there at this number</i>
<i>in ten minutes.</i>

175
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
If you're curious
to meet me,

176
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm gonna be in the lobby
of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville...

177
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,100
<i>reading</i> The New York Times
<i>tomorrow at 5:00.</i>

178
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,300
<i>Have you always lived in Louisville?</i>

179
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,500
Mr. Bergman, what did you
want me to consult about?

180
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,100
Who's that?

181
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,100
That's room service.

182
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,900
They usually
knock first.

183
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,300
Come on in.

184
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,500
Over here, please.

185
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,700
- Thank you.
- How do you like your coffee? Black?

186
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Black. Black.

187
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I really don't have that much time.

188
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,700
Is there anything you want to know
about me, Mr. Wigand?

189
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,000
Like what?
Your sign?

190
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
I know what I
have to know.

191
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,300
Just so I know you know,
when I talk to people in confidence,

192
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,200
it stays that way.

193
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,700
How did a radical journalist
from <i>Ramparts</i> magazine end up at CBS?

194
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,000
I still do
the tough stories.

195
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,300
<i>60 Minutes</i> reaches
a lot of people.

196
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,900
Let me see
the documents.

197
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
This is a, um,

198
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,100
fire-safety product study
for Phillip Morris.

199
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Burn rates, ignition propensity,
things of this nature.

200
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,100
I could very easily explain this
to you in layman's terms...

201
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,100
because it's from
another company.

202
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,000
- But that's as far as I go.
- As far as you go where?

203
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
This issue is
a drop in the bucket.

204
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,100
I can talk to you
about what's in here, but I...

205
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,800
I can't talk to you
about anything else.

206
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,200
I signed a confidentiality agreement.
I honor agreements.

207
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,500
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality
agreements, Mr. Bergman?

208
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,500
Between journalists and management,
yes, I believe they do.

209
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,900
But I don't take that seriously.
Where do you work?

210
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,900
Did work.

211
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,200
<i>- Did</i> work?
- How much would I get paid?

212
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,000
That you have to discuss
with CBS Business Affairs.

213
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,600
But for something like this, I would
say anywhere between ten, 12 thousand.

214
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,700
Should I just take
the documents now?

215
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,300
If you want to do it.

216
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,900
I worked as a, uh,

217
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,700
head of Research and Development
for Brown & Williamson.

218
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,300
Tobacco company.

219
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,300
I was a corporate
vice president.

220
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,100
Mr. Bergman.

221
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
<i>President Assad of Syria said...</i>

222
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,600
<i>that difficult obstacles remain,</i>
<i>but that his country,</i>

223
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,300
"looks forward to a great long peace
with Israel."

224
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,800
That's a Peabody, Mike.

225
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,000
When you're dead and buried, this is
the one they're gonna remember you by.

226
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,500
- Are you eating with us?
- Yeah.

227
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,300
- Bring a tie so they let us
in the front door.

228
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,400
Come on.

229
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,300
- Debbie!
<i>- Hey, Lowell.</i>

230
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,200
Oh, Bill. Main Justice is investigating
a major New York bank...

231
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,700
laundering narco dollars
out of their Mexico City branch.

232
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,900
- You want it for the news?
- What about you? You got a crew already?

233
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,900
- I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch you later.
- Okay.

234
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
- Debbie.
- How are you?

235
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,500
I want you to get Legal on a corporate
confidentiality agreement.

236
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,900
- Okay.
- Boundaries of their constraint,

237
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,900
Kentucky state law about...

238
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,900
<i>- I want you to drop everything.</i>
- Okay.

239
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,400
- I don't have any change.
You got some change?
<i>- Oh, here.</i>

240
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Tony.

241
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,300
<i>Mr. Wigand? You can go up now.</i>

242
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,400
Sorry. I'm accepting
an award...

243
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,200
from the Retinitis
Pigmentosa Foundation.

244
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,500
It's gonna kill
the rest of my day.

245
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,300
So, have you had a chance
to play golf?

246
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,200
Jeff's a premier golfer.
What are you, a two handicap?

247
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,400
- Seven.
- And he gets out there...

248
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,200
and he has
five strokes on us.

249
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,600
He has more concentration
than anybody I've ever met.

250
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,200
It's spooky
how he can concentrate.

251
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,300
I'd rather play
than talk about it.

252
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,500
What did you
want to see me about?

253
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,600
I don't like
being back here.

254
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,400
Jeffrey says exactly
what's on his mind.

255
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Most people consider
what they're saying... social skills.

256
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Jeffrey just charges
right ahead.

257
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Now, I know you understood the nature
of the confidentiality portion...

258
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,500
of your severance agreement
with Brown & Williamson.

259
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,500
- Chapter and verse.
- Yeah, I know you do.

260
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,500
You know, I came up
through sales.

261
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
One of the reasons
I was a great salesman...

262
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,100
was I never made a promise
I couldn't keep.

263
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,800
I knew that if I ever
broke my promise,

264
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,600
I'd suffer
the consequence.

265
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,600
Is that a threat?

266
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,400
We worked together for...
what was it, three years?

267
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,300
Now, the work we did here is
confidential, not for public scrutiny...

268
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,500
any more than
are one's family matters.

269
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,800
You're threatening
my family now too?

270
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,500
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.

271
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,100
About the direction of research here,
we may have had our differences, but...

272
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,800
Research. You declare
as a badge of honor you don't
even know what makes water boil.

273
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,300
Well, that's why
we hire scientists.

274
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,800
Okay.

275
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,700
I don't believe that you can
maintain corporate integrity...

276
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,600
without
confidentiality agreements.

277
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,800
I was paid well
for my work,

278
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,800
the health and welfare
benefits are good,

279
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,100
the severance package
is fair.

280
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,100
I have no intention of violating
my confidentiality agreement...

281
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,900
<i>and disclosing that</i>
<i>which I said I wouldn't.</i>

282
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,800
I appreciate
all that, Jeff,

283
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,600
but upon reflection, we've decided
to expand our zone of comfort with you,

284
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,600
so we've drafted a supplement
to your agreement.

285
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,300
<i>It broadly defines and</i>
<i>expands in more detail...</i>

286
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
what is confidential.

287
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,100
Nobody will be able
to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret,

288
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,800
I didn't know <i>that</i>
was a secret."

289
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,200
We're very serious
about protecting our interests.

290
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,900
We'd like you
to sign it.

291
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,700
And if I don't?

292
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,400
If we arrive at the conclusion
that you're acting in bad faith,

293
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,300
we would terminate right now
payoffs under your severance package,

294
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,500
you and your family's medical
benefits and initiate litigation
against you, Mr. Wigand.

295
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,900
<i>- Dr.</i> Wigand.
<i>- Dr. Wigand.</i>

296
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,500
<i>If you've examined the document, you'll</i>
<i>see it's in your own best interest...</i>

297
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,900
and you'll sign it.

298
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,100
What you're saying is it isn't enough
that you fired me for no good reason.

299
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Now you question
my integrity?

300
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,900
On top of the humiliation
of being fired, you threaten me,

301
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,300
you threaten
my family.

302
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,500
It never crossed my mind
not to honor my agreement.

303
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur...
and Brown & Williamson too...

304
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,900
Fuck me?
Well, fuck you!

305
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm not sure
he got the message.

306
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,700
Oh, I think he did.

307
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,900
- Yeah.
- You fucked me!

308
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,700
- Who's this?
- Protect your sources?

309
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
You screwed me.
You sold me out.

310
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,200
- What are you talking about?
Where are you?
- Fuck you too!

311
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,200
Stay away from me.

312
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
You stay away from me!

313
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,200
Jeffrey, you forgot
the lunches!

314
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,700
<i>- Mrs. Wigand?</i>
- Jump in quick. Come on.

315
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,300
How do you do? I'm Lowell Bergman.
We spoke on the phone.

316
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,400
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Good. I want to talk to you.

317
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,400
- This is my house.
In front of my wife, my kids?
- I did not burn you.

318
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,700
I did not give you up
to anyone.

319
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,900
- What business do we have?
- I'm here to straighten
something out with you.

320
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Right here, right now.

321
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,700
You haven't mentioned my name?
You haven't talked to anybody about me?

322
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,200
- What am I gonna mention your name for?
- Why are Brown & Williamson...

323
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
How the hell do I know about
Brown & Williamson?

324
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,600
It happened just after I talked to you.
I do not like coincidences.

325
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,700
Well, I don't like paranoid accusations.
I'm a journalist.

326
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,900
Think. Use your head.
How do I operate as a journalist?
By screwing the people...

327
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,200
who could provide me with information
before they provided me with it?

328
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,700
- You came all the way
down here to tell me that?
- No, I did not.

329
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,800
Big Tobacco
is a big story,

330
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,200
and you got something
important to say. I can tell.

331
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,900
But yes, I did. I came all
the way down here to tell you...

332
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,900
Story, no story...
fuck your story.

333
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,300
I don't burn people.

334
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,100
Ride with me while I
take the girls to school.

335
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,200
<i>My little girl has acute asthma.</i>

336
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,000
Deborah, my oldest daughter.

337
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,400
And I'm unemployed, so I have
to protect my medical coverage.

338
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,600
So I left them a message
this morning. Their expanded
confidentiality agreement...

339
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,300
I will sign it.

340
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,300
- They're afraid of you, aren't they?
- They should be.

341
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,900
Talk to me outside the zone
of your agreement.

342
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,000
- Like what?
- Like, uh, where'd you work
before Brown & Williamson?

343
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,300
Johnson &Johnson.

344
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,400
Union Carbide in Japan.

345
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,000
I was the general manager and director
of new products. I speak Japanese.

346
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,300
I was a director
of corporate development at Pfizer.

347
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,100
All health-related.

348
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
What else
outside the zone?

349
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
I don't know. Do you think the Knicks
are gonna make it to the semifinals?

350
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,600
- Just give me an example.
- Okay.

351
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,500
For example, um,
James Burke.

352
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,700
- C.E.O. Of Johnson &Johnson.
- Yeah.

353
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,600
When he found out that some lunatic
had put poison in Tylenol bottles,

354
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,600
he didn't argue
with the F.D.A.

355
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,300
He didn't even wait for the F.D.A.
To tell him. He just pulled Tylenol...

356
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,700
off every shelf of every store
right across America, instantly.

357
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,900
And then he developed a safety cap.

358
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,600
Because as a C.E.O., sure, he's
gotta be a great businessman, right?

359
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
But he's also
a man of science.

360
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,600
He's not gonna allow his company
to put on the shelf a product
that might hurt people.

361
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,700
Not like
the Seven Dwarfs.

362
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,600
- Seven Dwarfs?
- Seven C.E.O. S of Big Tobacco.

363
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
They got in front of Congress
that time. It was on television.

364
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Swore under oath that
they know nothing about addiction...

365
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
It was on C-SPAN.
Yeah.

366
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,800
Okay, so, here you are.
You-You-You go to work for tobacco.

367
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,600
You come from corporate cultures
where research...

368
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,600
really creative thinking...
these are core values.

369
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,000
You go to tobacco.
Tobacco is a sales culture...

370
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
market and sell enormous volume,
go to a lot of golf tournaments.

371
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,400
The hell with everything else.
What are you doing?

372
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,200
- Why are you working
for tobacco in the first place?
- I can't talk about it.

373
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,000
The work I was supposed to do...

374
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,100
might have had some positive effect,
I don't know.

375
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,800
Could have been beneficial.
Mostly, I got paid a lot.

376
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,100
I took the money.
My wife was happy.

377
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,600
My kids had good medical,
good schools. Got a great house.

378
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,900
I mean, what the hell
is wrong with that?

379
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,500
Nothing's wrong with that. That's it.
You're making money.

380
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,200
You're providing for your family.
What could be wrong with that?

381
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,000
I always thought of myself as a man of
science, that's what's wrong with it.

382
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,200
Then you're in
a state of conflict, Jeff.

383
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,000
Because look,
here's how it lays out.

384
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
If you've got vital
insider stuff,

385
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,800
the American people, for their
welfare, really do need to know,

386
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
and you feel impelled
to disclose it...

387
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,000
and violate your agreement
in doing so, that's one thing.

388
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,000
On the other hand, if you want
to honor this agreement,

389
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,300
then that's simple...
you do so.

390
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,600
You say nothing,
you do nothing.

391
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,900
There's only one guy
who can figure that out for you,

392
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,700
and that's you
all by yourself.

393
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,100
I gotta go pick up the girls.
They only had a half a day.

394
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,100
<i> I've heard virtually</i>
<i>all the... We touched on it...</i>

395
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>- Yes or no, do you believe</i>
<i>nicotine is not addictive?</i>
<i>- Congressman,</i>

396
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:01,300
<i>cigarettes and nicotine clearly</i>
<i>do not meet the classic</i>
<i>definitions of addiction.</i>

397
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,000
- There is no intoxication.
- We'll take that as no.

398
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,100
Again, time is short.

399
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,700
I think each of you believe
nicotine is not addictive...

400
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
<i>and just would like to</i>
<i>have this for the record.</i>

401
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,200
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

402
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,700
I too believe
that nicotine...

403
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,800
<i>He referred to this...</i>
<i>the Seven Dwarfs...</i>

404
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,900
- What Seven Dwarfs?
<i>- The seven C.E.O. Of Big Tobacco...</i>
<i>referred to this.</i>

405
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Said they should be afraid of him.
I assume afraid of what he could reveal.

406
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:33,000
Now you tell me. What does this guy
have to say that threatens these people?

407
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,200
Well, it isn't cigarettes
are bad for you.

408
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,500
- Hardly new news.
- No shit.

409
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,700
- What's this?
<i>- What that is is tobacco's</i>
<i>standard defense.</i>

410
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,700
It's the "we don't know"
litany.

411
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,500
Addiction? We believe not.
Disease? We don't know.

412
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,500
We take a bunch of leaves,
we roll them together, you smoke 'em.

413
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,900
After that, you're on your own.
We don't know.

414
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,100
<i>So, that</i>
<i>tells me nothing.</i>

415
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,400
- Besides, you'll never get
what he's got.
- Why not?

416
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,500
<i>Because of this guy's</i>
<i>confidentiality agreement,</i>

417
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,000
he's never gonna be able
to talk to you.

418
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,600
That's not good enough.
This guy is the top scientist...

419
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,200
in the number-three
tobacco company in America.

420
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,100
He's a corporate officer.
You never get whistle-blowers
from Fortune 500 companies.

421
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,900
This guy is
the ultimate insider.

422
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,100
He's got something to say. He wants
to say it. I want it on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

423
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,300
Doesn't matter what he wants.
<i>Am I missing something here?</i>

424
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,500
- What do you mean, Mike?
- He's got a corporate secrecy agreement.

425
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,900
Give me a break.

426
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,700
This is a public health issue, like an
unsafe air frame on a passenger jet...

427
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,700
or some company dumping cyanide
into the East River.

428
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,400
Issues like that.
He can talk, we can air it.

429
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,000
They've got no right to hide behind
a corporate agreement. Pass the milk.

430
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,700
They don't need the right.
They got the money.

431
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,300
The unlimited checkbook.
That's how Big Tobacco wins...

432
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
every time
on everything.

433
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,600
They spend you to death.
$600 million a year in outside legal.

434
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,600
Chadbourne-Park, Ken Starr's firm,
Kirkland and Ellis.

435
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,400
Listen, G.M. And Ford,
they get nailed...

436
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,500
after 11 or 12 pickups
blow up, right?

437
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,700
- These clowns have never... I mean ever...
<i>- Not even once.</i>

438
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,200
Not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year from an illness...

439
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,100
<i>related to their product have ever</i>
<i>lost a personal injury lawsuit.</i>

440
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,600
On this case, they'll issue gag orders,
sue for breach... anticipatory breach...

441
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:24,400
enjoin him, you, us,
his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian,

442
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,900
tie 'em up in litigation for ten
or 15 years, I'm telling you,
they bat a thousand.

443
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,600
Every time. He knows that.
That's why he's not gonna talk to you.

444
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,500
<i>Okay, let's look through</i>
<i>the looking glass the other way.</i>

445
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,300
What do you mean?

446
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,800
We got a guy who wants to talk,
but he's constrained.

447
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,000
- What if he were compelled to talk?
- Oh, torture. Great ratings.

448
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,200
What do you mean, "compelled"?

449
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,500
I mean, compelled
by a, uh, Justice Department.

450
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,600
State courts.
Be a witness.

451
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,900
That would cut through any
confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?

452
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,300
- What does that do?
- What do you mean, what does it do?

453
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,700
What I mean is like, how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement?

454
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,700
Because he has to, uh,
reveal it in a court of law.

455
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,600
It's on record. It's out.
It's no secret anymore.

456
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,400
So how can they restrain his speech
or retaliate? It's out in the world.

457
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,200
If you could engineer it into the
court record, you might have something.

458
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,300
They would have a hell of a time
trying to restrain his speech
then, wouldn't they?

459
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah, but what venue? And where does
he get... Does he have killer attorneys?

460
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,100
I don't think he's got
any attorneys.

461
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,700
<i>He's gonna need attorneys who aren't</i>
<i>afraid of risking years of litigation...</i>

462
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,000
and millions of dollars
of their own dough in legal costs.

463
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,700
What do you say, Mike?
What do you think?

464
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,800
Even if he gets
the defense team,

465
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,800
will he go for it?

466
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,000
You're awfully
overqualified, Dr. Wigand.

467
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,300
I'm trying to start
a new career.

468
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,300
I believe I could be
a good teacher.

469
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,900
Let me give it
some thought.

470
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,800
And not a lot of companies in the health
care field hire ex-tobacco scientists.

471
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,000
That's it.

472
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,300
It's where
our babies were born.

473
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,300
Debbie took her first steps
right there on...

474
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,400
In the grass.

475
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,100
- I didn't plan on this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

476
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,200
Come on. Come on.

477
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,500
We can make this
work for us. Okay?

478
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,400
It's just...
It's not...

479
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,300
It's just...
It's a smaller scale.

480
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,300
Simpler, easier.

481
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,700
More time.
More time together.

482
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,000
More time
with the kids.

483
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,900
More time for us.
Okay? It's just...

484
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,400
Can you imagine me
coming home from some job...

485
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
feeling good
at the end of the day?

486
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
This is gonna be better.

487
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,000
This is gonna be better.

488
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,500

494
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,900
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?

495
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,000
Who's that outside,
Daddy?

496
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,100
- Did you see somebody
or did you hear them?
- I heard him.

497
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,200
- Where?
- In the backyard.

498
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,100
Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?
Why don't you sit up at the desk.

499
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,100
All right?

500
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,200
Get out some paper,
and draw me a picture. Okay?

501
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,000
What are you gonna draw me, baby?
An animal? Something like that?

502
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,200
You stay down here until Daddy
gets back, all right, Barbara?

503
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,200
You stay down here.

504
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,900
You almost got
your damn head blown off.

505
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,600
Daddy!

506
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,600
It was just a raccoon, baby.
Nothin'.

507
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,200
They're nocturnal.
You know what that means?

508
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,700
That means that they
only come out at nighttime.

509
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,700
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

510
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,700
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

511
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,000
<i>Is it too late?</i>

512
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,300
No, no, it's okay. I...

513
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,300
How-How's the new place?

514
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,700
The new place?
New.

515
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,200
- You okay?
- Sure.

516
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,800
I was thinking of
calling you tomorrow anyway.

517
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,400
- Uh, how's your kids,
uh, handling the new house?
- Good.

518
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,800
- You got kids?
- We have a couple.

519
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,800
One's hers, one's mine.
Everybody uses a different name.

520
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,900
Modern marriage.

521
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,100
Uh, how's Liane?

522
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,200
Uh, she's okay. Uh...

523
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,200
Hold on a minute.

524
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,300
Lowell.

525
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,500
Somebody may be following me. I-I don't
know. They came on the property.

526
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,900
What do you mean, following you?
Did you call the police?

527
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,800
I-I don't wanna be paranoid.
I mean...

528
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,800
- Maybe it's a game.
Some kind of mind game.
- What do you really think?

529
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,800
I don't know what the fuck
I really think.

530
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,900
Are they doing it?
Is some crank doing it?

531
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,900
Are they doing it
to make me feel paranoid?

532
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,900
Are they doing it for real and don't
give a shit what I think? I don't know.

533
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,800
- I don't fuckin' know.
- Jeffrey, describe for me...

534
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,800
in detail what happened.

535
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,000
Well...

536
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,500
No. Look, I mean, there was
a footprint. Forget it.

537
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,100
It's probably
not important at all.

538
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,100
You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching
high school. Japanese and Chemistry.

539
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,200
Uh, so, uh, what were you
calling about?

540
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,900
- You called me.
- No, you said you were gonna
call me tomorrow.

541
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,700
- So, what about?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes. I did.
I wanted to talk to you.

542
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,500
I wanted to hook up with you,
talk to you about what we were
talking about in your car.

543
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,500
Okay.

544
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,200
It makes you feel good,
putting what you know to use?

545
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,700
- How'd you know that, Lowell?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

546
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,200
Hello?
Are you there?

547
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,700
Yeah.

548
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,300
Look, um...

549
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,600
Thanks for talking.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

550
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,200
- I didn't know.
- It's okay.

551
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,700
Lowell.

552
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Who is this?

553
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,200
<i>Do not call here!</i>
<i>Do not...</i>

554
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,800
What are you
gonna get us?

555
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,900
Tempura.

556
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,200
The Internet said you did
graduate work at Wisconsin,

557
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,800
then went to U.C. La Jolla
with Professor Herbert?

558
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,300
- Marcus...
- Marcuse. Yeah.

559
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,600
He was my mentor.

560
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,900
He had a major influence
on the New Left in the late '60s.

561
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,100
And on me, personally.

562
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,600
- Next to your father?
- My father?

563
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,200
What the hell's that got
to do with my father?

564
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,500
I, uh...

565
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,600
Is that why you became a journalist?
Then you get to ask all the questions?

566
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,000
You charge by the hour?

567
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,000
My father was a...
A mechanical engineer.

568
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,100
Most ingenious man
I ever knew.

569
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,200
My father left us
when I was five years old.

570
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,100
He was not the most ingenious man
I ever knew.

571
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,800
Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.
If you decide to go on <i>60 Minutes,</i>

572
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,200
I gotta know everything
about why you were fired.

573
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,300
- Why?
- They're gonna dig up
stuff from your past.

574
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,100
They're gonna throw it at you.
I gotta know what they're gonna throw.

575
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You understand?

576
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,500
I drink.

577
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,300
- Couple of occasions
more than I should have.
- Um-hmm.

578
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,300
I was cited for shoplifting
once, but it was a mistake.

579
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,900
Pushed Liane one time. We were both
stressed out because of the pressure.

580
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,600
She went to her mother's.

581
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,700
I got, uh, fired,
because, uh,

582
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,600
when I get angry, I have
difficulty censoring myself,

583
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,500
and I don't like
to be pushed around.

584
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,100
I'm not pushing you around.
I'm asking you questions.

585
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,200
I'm just a commodity
to you, aren't I?

586
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,600
I could be anything, right? Anything
worth putting on between commercials.

587
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,000
To a network, probably,
we're all commodities.

588
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,500
To me, you're not a commodity.
What you are is important.

589
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,000
You go public, and 30 million people
hear what you gotta say,

590
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,500
nothing... I mean nothing...
will ever be the same again.

591
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,800
- You believe that?
- No.

592
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,700
You should. Because when
you're done the judgment...

593
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,800
is gonna go down in the court
of public opinion, my friend.

594
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,500
And that's...
the power you have.

595
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,800
- You believe that?
- I believe that?

596
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,700
- Yes, I believe that.
- You believe that...

597
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,600
- because you get information out
to people, something happens?
- Yes.

598
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,400
Maybe that's just what you've been
telling yourself all these years...

599
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,400
to justify having a good job.

600
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
Having status.

601
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,600
Maybe for the audience
it's just voyeurism, something
to do on a Sunday night.

602
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,600
Maybe it won't
change a fuckin' thing,

603
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,300
and people like myself
and my family...

604
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,400
are left hung out to dry,
used up, broke, alone.

605
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,600
Are you talking to me, or did somebody
else just walk in here? I never...

606
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,400
Don't evade a choice you gotta make
by questioning my reputation...

607
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,700
or <i>60 Minutes</i>
with this cheap skepticism.

608
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,700
I have to put my family's welfare
on the line here, my friend.

609
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,400
- What are you putting up?
You're putting up words.
- "Words."

610
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,700
While you've been dicking around some
fucking company golf tournaments,

611
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,700
I've been out in the world
givin' my word...

612
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,300
and backing it up
with action.

613
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,200
Now, are you gonna go
and do this thing or not?

614
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,100
I said I'd call the kids
before they went to bed.

615
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,200
<i>Stringer was supposed to be shooting</i>
<i>B- roll on street cops in New Orleans.</i>

616
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,600
<i>- What's with all the horses?</i>
<i>- Camera guy's got</i>
<i>a thing about mounted police.</i>

617
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,200
Don't any of these guys
ride in cars? Walk?

618
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,600
- How long are these things?
- What was he saying?

619
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,200
Hello. Yes, I'm trying
to reach Mr. Richard Scruggs.

620
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,600
This is Richard Scruggs.

621
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,600
Can you hold on
a second, please?

622
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,000
Lowell, got him
on the phone.

623
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,400
- Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.
- Hold on.

624
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,400
Mobile Approach, this is
Leo-November-643. Over.

625
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,900
Request a flight level
of 220...

626
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,700
on a heading
of 284 degrees. Over.

627
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,400
- Mr. Bergman?
- Yes, I'm right here.

628
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,200
- Could you call me back on a hard line?
- All right.

629
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:57,900
- Area code 212-555-0199.
<i>- I'll call you then.</i>

630
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,800
<i>What do we do with that?</i>

631
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,300
I don't know.

632
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,300
Richard Scruggs.

633
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:14,500
You filed a lawsuit against tobacco
on behalf of the state of Mississippi.

634
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,600
<i>- Did you not?</i>
- That's right.

635
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,100
<i>I'm working with someone now</i>
<i>who's the former head of</i>
<i>research at Brown & Williamson.</i>

636
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,800
<i>Former corporate officer there.</i>

637
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
What's your interest
in this, Mr. Bergman?

638
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,300
Well, he may tape
an interview with us,

639
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,700
and we believe if his testimony
showed up in a court record first,

640
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,800
<i>it would free him up from his</i>
<i>confidentiality agreement</i>
<i>and give him some protection.</i>

641
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,800
It could work. If it's public record,
it's public record.

642
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,400
<i>Yeah, and he's gonna need</i>
<i>legal representation.</i>

643
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,600
He sure as hell will.

644
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,400
Has he decided
to go public?

645
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,200
Because let me tell ya.
We been doin' this for three years now,

646
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,700
and we've worked with a lot of corporate
cases involving whistle-blowers.

647
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,100
So we know Big Tobacco will do
everything in their power to stop him.

648
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,300
So is your man
truly committed?

649
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,600
Well, actually, no... Well, he's
on the fence. That's the point.

650
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,700
Well, we'd certainly be interested
in making his acquaintance.

651
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,300
But without knowing
what he's gonna do...

652
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,700
Would you want him to call you, or you
wanna call him? How do you wanna do it?

653
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,600
It would be better
if he called us.

654
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right?

655
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,100
Okay. Thank you.
Shit.

656
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,800
We need cops on the streets.
We don't need them on horses.

657
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,800
- I don't know what he was thinking.
- For God's sake.

658
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,900
- This guy got a horse fetish?
- All right, all right.

659
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,200
Get me, uh...
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.

660
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,500
I'll shoot
the fucking thing myself!

661
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,800
- Have a good one.
<i>- All right.</i>

662
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,600
<i>What are you cooking?</i>

663
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,500
- I'm cooking pasta primavera.
<i>- Oh, I love that stuff.</i>

664
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,100
I'm going to
have to go downstairs.

665
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,900
Jeffrey!

666
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,000
<i>Jeffrey! Jeffrey!</i>

667
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:14,400
<i>Jeffrey! Jeffrey!</i>

668
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,500
<i>- What happened?</i>
<i>- Dispatcher received a call</i>
<i>of shots fired in the area.</i>

669
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:51,300
Uniforms arrived on the scene, found
this white male subject shot to death.

670
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,600
- Was it gang related?
- There's no indication...

671
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,600
as far as a tag or an advertisement.

672
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,200
Yeah.

673
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,300
They're terrorizing us.
Death threats. My family, my kids.

674
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,400
Whoa. What are you
talking about?

675
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,900
- Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
- Jeff, call the F.B.I.

676
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,200
- Right away.
- They do this with impunity.

677
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,700
- Jeff...
- They get to go home at night.

678
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,500
What does it cost these people
to do this to us? Nothing!

679
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,200
My girls are crying.
So fuck them.

680
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,200
- I wanna tape. I'm done...
- I heard you.

681
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,800
I gotta arrange
for a legal defense first.

682
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:32,000
I gotta get you to testify in court,
get it on public record.

683
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,800
Then hold it off the air until you
got that, but I wanna go to New York,

684
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,300
and I wanna go on the record...
right now.

685
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,600
- Good. But, Jeff...
- I'll call them, Lowell.

686
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,800
Did you handle the round,
Mr. Wigand?

687
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,900
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

688
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,600
We won't be able to lift
usable prints.

689
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,100
Do you own a gun,
Mr. Wigand?

690
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,700
- A gun? Yes.
- What caliber is your gun?

691
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,300
What caliber is <i>my</i> gun?

692
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,300
Yes, sir.
What caliber is your gun?

693
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,300
What does that have to do
with the price of tea in China?

694
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,900
You think I put the bullet
in the mailbox myself?

695
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,500
If we could
take a look, Mr. Wigand.

696
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,700
Why do you keep this gun?

697
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,300
I don't think it's unconstitutional
yet to own a gun. I'm a target shooter.

698
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,400
That bullet was for a.38 caliber.
Do you own a.38?

699
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,600
<i>Yes, I do. A.38 Target Master</i>
<i>in my gun safe downstairs.</i>

700
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,700
A.45 Gold Cup,
a.22 target pistol. So what?

701
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,700
Do you have a history
of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?

702
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,900
Yeah. Yes, I do.

703
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,800
Yes, I get extremely emotional when
assholes put bullets in my mailbox.

704
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:06,000
I didn't tell you that so you could
pick it up and take it away.

705
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,600
- Jeffrey!
- What's going on?

706
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,600
I told them you had an e-mail
death threat that told you...

707
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,500
if you didn't shut the "F" up,
they were gonna kill you.

708
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,000
You can't take that. It's personal
property. My personal correspondence,

709
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,800
letters to my brother, my will.

710
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,400
You all right?

711
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,600
That computer has
every single...

712
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,900
<i>You all right, Mr. Wigand?</i>

713
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,000
We need to take a look
at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand.

714
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:11,000
I'm telling <i>you...</i> your agents
in that office are acting improperly.

715
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,000
Now who are they
trying to protect?

716
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,000
Let me, tell you something,
Lowell. Look, look.

717
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,400
You're talking about two agents
in a regional office in Louisville.

718
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,600
I got the goddamned Unabomber
threatening to blow up L.A.X.

719
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,900
I gotta move 45 agents
from all over the country into L.A.

720
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
All right? When I get a chance,
I'll give it a look.

721
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,000
You better take a good
look because I'm getting two things:

722
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,100
Pissed off and curious!

723
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:37,100
Now, any of these guys been offered jobs
in corporate security after they retire?

724
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,500
Either one of those guys got
ex-agent pals already in those jobs?

725
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,800
Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor
who's already at Brown & Williamson...

726
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,900
as we fuckin' speak!

727
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,900
- I'll give it a look.
- You're getting my drift?

728
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,900
I'll give it a look.

729
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,800
So is everything okay?

730
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,200
- How are the rooms? Comfortable?
- Yes, very.

731
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,400
Do you know,
I enjoy your work so much.

732
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,100
When you're talkin' to somebody,
I always feel like I'm right there.

733
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,400
Thank you for saying that.

734
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,600
Do you think we could
talk about the taping?

735
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:14,100
Tomorrow's taping? Just so we
can get it out of the way and order.

736
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:19,200
Yeah, well, questions will go
towards what work you did there,
why you were fired and other...

737
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,900
Taping?

738
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,700
- What are you taping?
- I'm doin' an interview.

739
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,800
An interview?

740
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Do you know what
they will do to us?

741
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I thought we...

742
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,900
I'm sorry.

743
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,900
Liane, this is
a preliminary...

744
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,400
You didn't
tell her we were taping?

745
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:09,200
What did she think she was
coming to New York for?

746
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,700
Talk about it, think about it.
I had a plan to, uh, ease her into it,

747
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,700
but I really...
I don't know how to do that.

748
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,900
Oh, man.

749
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,000
Who are these people?

750
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,000
Ordinary people under
extraordinary pressure, Mike.

751
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,600
What the hell you expect,
grace and consistency?

752
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,000
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

753
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,700
You heard Mr. Sandefur say...

754
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,400
before Congress that he believed
nicotine was not addictive.

755
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,500
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

756
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,500
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

757
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,800
<i> All of us did. I mean,</i>
<i>there was this whole line of people,</i>

758
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,300
<i>whole line of C.E.O. 's</i>
<i>up there swearing.</i>

759
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,400
<i>Part of the reason</i>
<i>I'm here is that I felt...</i>

760
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,100
that their representation
clearly misstated...

761
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,100
at least within Brown & Williamson's
representation...

762
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,500
clearly misstated what is common
language within the company.

763
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,800
We are in
the nicotine delivery business.

764
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,000
And that's what
cigarettes are for.

765
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,300
Delivery device for nicotine.

766
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,400
A delivery device
for nicotine.

767
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,200
Put it in your mouth, light it up
and you're going to get your fix.

768
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:02,700
- You're gonna get your fix.
<i>- You're saying that</i>
<i>Brown & Williamson...</i>

769
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,800
<i>manipulates and adjusts</i>
<i>the nicotine fix...</i>

770
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,000
not by artificially
adding nicotine,

771
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
but by enhancing
the effect of nicotine...

772
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,500
<i>through the use</i>
<i>of chemical elements such as ammonia.</i>

773
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,300
The process is known
as impact boosting.

774
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,100
<i>While not spiking nicotine,</i>

775
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,100
<i>they clearly manipulate it.</i>

776
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:28,600
There is extensive use of this
technology, known as ammonia chemistry.

777
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,200
It allows for the nicotine to be
more rapidly absorbed in the lung...

778
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,000
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

779
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,800
<i>The straw that broke the camel's</i>
<i>back for me and really put me</i>
<i>in trouble with Sandefur...</i>

780
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,600
was a compound called coumarin.

781
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,600
When I came on board
at B&W,

782
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,400
they had tried to transition
from coumarin to a similar flavor...

783
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,100
that would give the same taste
and had been unsuccessful.

784
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,800
I wanted it out immediately.
I was told...

785
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
that it would effect sales, so
I should mind my own business.

786
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
indicating I could not in conscience...

787
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,800
continue with coumarin
in a product that we now knew...

788
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:14,400
we had documentation... was similar to
coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen.

789
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,200
And you sent the document
forward to Sandefur?

790
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,200
I sent the document
forward to Sandefur.

791
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,700
I was told that we would
continue to work on a substitute.

792
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:26,500
We weren't going to remove it
as it would impact sales
and that that was his decision.

793
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,400
<i> In other words,</i>
<i>you are charging Sandefur...</i>

794
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,400
and Brown & Williamson...

795
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,700
with ignoring health
considerations consciously?

796
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,000
- Most certainly.
- And on March 24,

797
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,800
Thomas Sandefur,
C.E.O. Of Brown & Williamson,

798
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,200
had you fired.

799
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,700
<i>And the reason</i>
<i>he gave you?</i>

800
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,900
Poor communication skills.

801
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:58,700
And you wish
you hadn't come forward?

802
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,400
You wish you hadn't
blown the whistle?

803
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,400
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

804
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,500
There are times I feel com...
compelled to do it.

805
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,500
If you'd asked me...

806
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,100
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

807
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,100
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

808
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

809
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,900
My name is Jeff Wigand.

810
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,800
You can call me, uh,
Mr. Wigand.

811
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,800
You can call me
Dr. Wigand.

812
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,400
I have a Ph.D. In biochemistry
and endocrinology.

813
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,200
You can call me Jeff.

814
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,800
Anything else you want to call me,
you'll have to do so in private.

815
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:23,700
Um, okay.

816
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,900
I find chemistry
to be magical.

817
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,100
I find it an adventure.

818
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:32,600
An exploration into the building
blocks of our physical universe.

819
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,100
So how many of you have
taken chemistry before?

820
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,100
Okay. I've never taught it
before, so we're gonna be fine.

821
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,000
Our first experiment
is gonna be measuring...

822
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,100
the molecular weight
of butane.

823
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,700
He's on line three.

824
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:58,100
- Hello?
- Mr. Scruggs? Jeff Wigand.

825
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,100
Lowell Bergman said
I should give you a call.

826
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,700
My co-counsel,
Ron Motley and I,

827
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,200
have filed a lawsuit against
the tobacco industry on behalf
of the state of Mississippi...

828
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,800
to get the state
reimbursed Medicaid costs...

829
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,400
for treatin' people
with smoking-related illness.

830
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,600
If you'd be interested
in talkin' to us,

831
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,100
we'd certainly like
to talk to you.

832
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,900
When should we do this?

833
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,100
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing in my house?

834
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,700
<i>- It's okay, Jeff. It's okay.</i>
- Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

835
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:54,100
You've got
your own security now.

836
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,600
You know, Lowell,
I can't... I can't afford to...

837
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:02,900
No, they volunteered.
A friend owns a large security company.

838
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,900
<i>How're you doing, Mr. Wigand?</i>
<i>I'm John Telafarro.</i>

839
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,900
There'll be three of us
on the detail.

840
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:13,200
I'm going to the store. Please explain
our new houseguests to your children.

841
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,300
Mrs. Wigand's leaving the house.

842
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,200
Uh, I called Richard Scruggs
in Mississippi.

843
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:29,700
- I heard.
- I'm gonna be a witness for them
in their litigation.

844
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,300
So I'm gonna fly to Pascagoula,
give a deposition.

845
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,600
I know. I'm gonna
go there tonight.

846
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,400
<i>You all right?</i>

847
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,000
- Did you have a good day?
- Yes, I did. I had a great day.

848
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,600
<i>- Uh, coffee, Lowell?</i>
- Yeah, all right.

849
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,000
Wanna play that game
we were playing before?

850
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,800
You know, I think you
got it up to five.

851
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,300
<i>I was ahead of you,</i>
<i>and then you just...</i>

852
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:18,400
Please don't wash your hands
in the sink.

853
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,600
Where should I wash them?

854
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,100
Use the bathroom.

855
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,100
What's the difference?

856
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,000
That's for food.

857
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,700
Leave it on.
Just leave it on! Okay?

858
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:44,100
I don't think
I can do this.

859
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,700
I want to stand by
my husband.

860
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,100
I really do, Jeffrey,
but...

861
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,400
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

862
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,600
I am so sorry.

863
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,900
Can we talk about this
when I get back?

864
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,400
Yes, Jeffrey.

865
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,200
It's okay.

866
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,000
Jeff!

867
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,600
You've been served.

868
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,700
Now, what this one is is
a temporary restraining order,

869
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,300
a gag order,
issued by a Kentucky court.

870
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,000
Jeff Wigand,
Michael Moore.

871
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,100
Good to meet you,
Dr. Wigand.

872
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,100
<i>Mike's our attorney general</i>
<i>down here.</i>

873
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,400
<i>I was just explaining to Jeff</i>
<i>they got a Kentucky court...</i>

874
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,300
<i>to issue a gag order</i>
<i>to stop his deposition today.</i>

875
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,500
<i>- Right.</i>
- Now,

876
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,000
they tried to get
the Mississippi court to honor it,

877
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,000
but the judge threw it out.

878
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,900
However, for you, there is a more
perilous effect of the gag order.

879
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,900
Dr. Wigand, you do understand
what can happen, don't you?

880
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:47,000
I'm not free to testify...
here.

881
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,900
That's right. If you violate
the Kentucky order,

882
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,100
when you
step foot back in Kentucky...

883
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,200
they can find you in contempt
and they can incarcerate you.

884
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,100
And you ought to know that.

885
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,100
- Jail.
- Possibly, yes.

886
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,100
That is one of the possible consequences
of your testifying here today.

887
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,200
That's right.

888
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:16,800
How does...
How does one go to jail?

889
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:20,500
Wh-What does my family do?

890
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,000
Go on welfare?

891
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,300
If my wife has to work,
who's gonna look after the kids?

892
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,900
Put food on the table?
I mean, my children need me.

893
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,200
If I'm not teaching,
there's no medical.

894
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,200
No medical, even on co-pay,
that's like... Tuition...

895
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,100
Dr. Wigand, listen.

896
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,700
You may not be able
to do this thing.

897
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,500
As I understand from Dick,
you're our key witness,

898
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,000
and I hope
you don't withdraw.

899
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,500
Um, I guess we'd all
understand if you did.

900
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,900
Guys, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for court.

901
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,300
I'll see y'all later.
Dr. Wigand, good luck.

902
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,700
I know what you're facing,
Jeff.

903
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,800
And I think I know
how you're feeling.

904
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,100
In the navy, I flew
A-6's off carriers.

905
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,500
In combat, events have
a duration of seconds.

906
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,800
Sometimes minutes.

907
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,700
But what you're going through
goes on day in, day out,

908
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,000
whether you're
ready for it or not.

909
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Week in, week out.

910
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,700
Month after month
after month.

911
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,300
Whether you're up
or whether you're down.

912
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:39,400
You're assaulted
psychologically.

913
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,900
You're assaulted
financially,

914
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:46,600
which is its own special kind
of violence because it's
directed at your kids.

915
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,000
What school can you afford?

916
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,500
How will that
affect their lives?

917
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,500
You're asking yourself,

918
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,900
"Will that limit
what they may become?"

919
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,600
You feel your whole family's future
is compromised,

920
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,200
held hostage.

921
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,500
I do know how it is.

922
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,800
You attract a crowd.

923
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,900
Yeah.
Great.

924
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:27,800
I heard about
the Kentucky gag order.

925
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,000
I don't know what to do.

926
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,800
Hold on a second.

927
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:43,800
Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
expects his witness to appear or not?

928
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,500
I can't seem to find
the criteria to decide.

929
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,800
It's too big a decision to make
without being resolved in my own mind.

930
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,200
Maybe things have changed.

931
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,300
A lot's changed.

932
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,600
You mean since this morning?

933
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,200
No, I mean since whenever.

934
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,800
Fuck it.

935
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,000
Let's go to court.

936
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,800
<i>Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.</i>

937
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,900
Okay, Jeff. I'm gonna sit you down
at that table over there.

938
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,900
I want to start
as fast as possible.

939
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,200
I don't want to give them a chance to
get another restraining order. Okay?

940
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,300
- Let's go.
- Good luck, Doc.

941
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:00,200
Please stand.
Raise your right hand.

942
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:04,500
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

943
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:07,700
<i>- I do.</i>
<i>- You may be seated.</i>

944
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,600
<i>You understand, Dr. Wigand,</i>
<i>you are under oath?</i>

945
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:14,800
This is a sworn deposition.
There's no judge. It's not a trial.

946
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,000
Will you state your name
for the record?

947
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,600
Jeffrey S. Wigand.
R-E-Y. W-I-G-A-N-D.

948
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,600
Got any idea what's
going on in there?

949
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,600
No, I don't have
a clue.

950
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,200
- That is correct.
- In other words, it acts as a drug,

951
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,500
- Object to the form of the question.
- It acts as a drug...

952
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,400
- Object to the form...
- It acts as a drug...

953
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,600
- Object!
- Is there an echo in here?

954
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,700
<i>Your objection's been recorded.</i>

955
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,800
<i>She typed it into her little machine</i>
<i>over there. It's on the record.</i>

956
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,500
<i>So now I'll proceed</i>
<i>with my deposition of my witness.</i>

957
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,600
- Does it act as a drug?
- Dr. Wigand!

958
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,200
I am instructing you...

959
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,800
<i>not to answer that question.</i>

960
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,500
In accordance to the terms of
the contractual obligations...

961
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,200
<i>undertaken by you...</i>

962
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,100
<i>not to disclose</i>
<i>any information...</i>

963
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:14,000
about your work at the Brown
& Williamson Tobacco Company.

964
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,300
And in accordance
with the force and effect...

965
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,300
of the temporary
restraining order...

966
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,600
<i>that has been</i>
<i>entered against you...</i>

967
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,500
<i>by the court</i>
<i>in the state of Kentucky.</i>

968
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,200
That means you don't talk.

969
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,400
Mr. Motley, we have rights here.

970
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,800
Oh, you've got rights.

971
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:36,900
And lefts.
Ups and downs and middles.

972
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,700
So what? You don't get
to instruct anything around here!

973
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,900
This is not North Carolina,
not South Carolina, nor Kentucky.

974
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,400
This is the sovereign state
of Mississippi's proceeding.

975
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,300
Wipe that smirk off your face!

976
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:56,300
Dr. Wigand's deposition
will be part of this record!

977
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:00,500
And I'm gonna take my witness' testimony
whether the hell you like it or not!

978
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,500
Answer the question,
Doctor.

979
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:21,600
<i>Yes. It produces</i>
<i>a physiological response, which</i>
<i>meets the definition of a drug.</i>

980
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,000
Um, nicotine
is associated with...

981
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,600
impact, satisfaction.

982
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:32,100
It has a pharmacological effect that
crosses the blood-brain barrier intact.

983
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,900
<i>Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.</i>

984
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,300
One of the reasons
I'm here is that I felt...

985
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,600
that their representation
clearly...

986
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:34,000
Run that Sandefur piece
on "nicotine's not addictive."

987
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,600
Run that on camera, then cut right to
Wigand with "I believe they perjured..."

988
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:40,600
Then go wide to the C.E.O. S
all taking the oath.

989
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,600
Then back on Jeff...

990
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,100
and play the pause after
the word "felt" on the B-side.

991
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:49,600
Hell of a show, Mike.
Explosive material.

992
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:54,500
- It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
- Good.

993
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,700
- I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

994
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:01,200
They argued that he was going
to reveal the secret formula
of Kools to the world.

995
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:06,200
<i>Sealed doesn't hurt Scruggs’ litigation,</i>

996
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,900
<i>and since we're the only ones</i>
<i>with the story, I believe</i>
<i>we're sitting on an exclusive.</i>

997
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,400
I like that.
<i>Corporate has some questions.</i>

998
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,900
<i>We've got a meeting at "Black Rock"</i>
<i>first thing in the morning.</i>

999
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:19,100
- When's the air date?
<i>- Lowell, Sharon's on line three.</i>

1000
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:23,200
- Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
<i>- Here we go.</i>

1001
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,700
That they had long
known that the nicotine in tobacco...

1002
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:30,100
is an addictive drug despite their
public statements to the contrary.

1003
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,800
Like the testimony before Congress
of Dr. Wigand's former boss,

1004
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,900
Brown & Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

1005
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:40,400
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

1006
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,200
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

1007
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,700
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

1008
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,300
All of us did.
There was this whole line of people,

1009
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,700
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

1010
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,500
Part of the reason
I'm here is that I felt...

1011
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,800
that their representation
clearly misstated...

1012
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:00,200
what is common language
within the company.

1013
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:02,400
We are in the nicotine
delivery business.

1014
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:06,000
<i>There is extensive use of this</i>
<i>technology, known as ammonia chemistry.</i>

1015
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,100
<i>It allows for the nicotine to be</i>
<i>more rapidly absorbed in the lung...</i>

1016
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,800
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

1017
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:15,900
That's what cigarettes are for.
- Delivery device for nicotine.

1018
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,900
A delivery device
for nicotine. Put it in your mouth,

1019
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,900
light it up and
you're going to get your fix.

1020
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,300
You're going to get your fix.

1021
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,600
- Shall I send for coffee?
Sorry I'm late.
- No, we're fine.

1022
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:33,500
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1023
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,800
All right. I thought
we'd get together...

1024
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:37,800
because there's
a legal concept...

1025
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,600
that has been getting
some new attention recently.

1026
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:42,800
Tortious interference.

1027
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:46,700
<i>If two people have an agreement,</i>
<i>like a confidentiality agreement,</i>

1028
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:51,100
and one of them breaks it because they
are induced to do so by a third party,

1029
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,400
the third party can be sued
for damages for interfering.

1030
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,600
Hence, tortious interference.

1031
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:59,800
"Interfering"?
That's what we do.

1032
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:02,600
<i>I think what we're trying to tell you</i>
<i>is that it happens all the time.</i>

1033
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:06,700
This is a news organization. People are
always telling us things they shouldn't.

1034
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:10,900
We have to verify if it's true
and in the public interest.
And if it is, we air it.

1035
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,300
And after we corroborate it.
That's why we've never lost
a lawsuit and run a classy show.

1036
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:20,300
- Anything else?
- And <i>60 Minutes'</i> verification
is exact and precise.

1037
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,400
And I don't think it would hurt
to make sure you're right on this one.

1038
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:28,300
<i>Why? You think we have liability?</i>

1039
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,400
What's the CBS News position,
Eric?

1040
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,600
There's a possibility.
It's rather remote.

1041
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:35,700
But one we
have to check on, Mike.

1042
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,300
I've retained outside counsel
to do exactly that...

1043
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:43,000
on a segment, I might add,
that's already rife with problems.

1044
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:45,000
What does that mean?
"Rife with..."

1045
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,300
I'm told unusual promises
were made to Wigand.

1046
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,600
No, only that we would hold his story
until it was safe for him.

1047
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:54,800
And I'm told there are questions
as to our star witness' veracity.

1048
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,700
His "veracity" was good enough
for the state of Mississippi.

1049
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,300
Our standards have to be
higher than anyone else's,

1050
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,400
because we are the standard
for everybody else.

1051
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:08,700
Well, as a "standard," I'll hang with
"is this guy telling the truth?"

1052
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,500
Well, with tortious interference,
I'm afraid...

1053
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,100
the greater the truth,
the greater the damage.

1054
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:19,000
- Come again?
- They own...

1055
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,600
the information he's disclosing.

1056
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,700
The truer it is,

1057
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:25,900
the greater
the damage to them.

1058
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,600
If he lied, he didn't
disclose their information,
and the damages are smaller.

1059
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:39,500
- Is this <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>
- You said "on this one."

1060
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,500
What about this one?

1061
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:45,200
<i>If this holds up...</i>
<i>And it very well may not, Mike.</i>

1062
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:48,700
But if it did
and we aired this segment,

1063
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:52,700
and CBS was sued
by Brown & Williamson,

1064
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,900
I think we could be
at grave risk.

1065
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,800
- How grave?
<i>- Well, at the end of the day,</i>

1066
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,500
because of your segment,

1067
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,000
the Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Company...

1068
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:06,100
could own CBS.

1069
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,100
Oh. You know,

1070
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:15,200
I am sorry,
but I'm due upstairs.

1071
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,200
Is CBS Corporate
telling CBS News...

1072
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:21,700
"Do not go to air
with this story"?

1073
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,500
You're getting ahead of yourself.
We're all in this together.

1074
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,800
We're all CBS.
We'll find out soon.

1075
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,700
Thank you, gentlemen.

1076
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,700
"Tortious interference."

1077
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:42,000
That sounds like a disease
caught by a radio.

1078
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,500
<i>- Lunch?</i>
- Sure.

1079
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,900
Don't worry.
We call the shots around here.

1080
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,800
Hello?

1081
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:05,700
Debbie, it's me. I want
you to check some filings,

1082
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:08,300
and give me John Wilson's number
at Bear-Stearn.

1083
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:19,000
- What now?
- Kluster's coming over.

1084
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,600
<i>Hello, Lowell, Mike.</i>

1085
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:31,000
<i>Don.</i>

1086
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:35,400
There has been so much soul searching
about this Wigand.

1087
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,800
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of
the show without his interview.

1088
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,900
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of
the show without his interview.

1089
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,600
So what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
checking with outside counsel first?

1090
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:46,600
- All that crap?
- That's happening.

1091
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:49,200
Hopefully, we won't have to use
the alternate, but we should
have it in the can.

1092
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,600
- I'm not touching my film.
- I'm afraid you are.

1093
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:55,800
- No, I'm not.
- We're doing this
with or without you, Lowell.

1094
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:59,900
If you like, I can assign
another producer to edit your show.

1095
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,100
Since when has the, uh,

1096
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:07,600
paragon of
investigative journalism...

1097
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,800
allowed lawyers to determine
the news content on <i>60 Minutes?</i>

1098
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,400
<i>It's an alternate version.</i>

1099
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,100
So what if we have
an alternate version?

1100
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:19,800
And I don't think our being cautious
is so damned unreasonable.

1101
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:23,000
So now, if you will
excuse me, gentlemen,

1102
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,700
Mr. Rather's been complaining
about his chair again.

1103
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:28,600
Before you go,

1104
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,600
I discovered this.

1105
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:38,200
S.E.C. Filing for the sale of CBS
Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

1106
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,600
- What?
- Yeah, I heard rumors.

1107
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,800
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.
If Tisch can unload CBS...

1108
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:46,200
for $81 a share
to Westinghouse,

1109
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:48,200
and then is
suddenly threatened...

1110
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:52,000
with a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit from Brown & Williamson,

1111
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
that could screw up the sale,
could it not?

1112
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,000
<i>- What are you implying?</i>
- I'm not implying. I'm quoting.

1113
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:02,000
Uh, " More vested interests. Persons
who will profit from this merger.

1114
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:07,300
"Ms. Helen Caperelli, general counsel
of CBS News, 3.9 million.

1115
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,500
"Mr. Eric Kluster,
president of CBS News,

1116
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,400
1.4 million."

1117
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:16,600
<i> Are you suggesting that</i>
<i>she and Eric are influenced by money?</i>

1118
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:20,600
No, no, of course they're not
influenced by money. They work for free.

1119
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,200
And you are a volunteer
executive producer.

1120
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:27,100
CBS does not do that. And you're
questioning our journalistic integrity.

1121
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:29,200
No, I'm questioning
your hearing.

1122
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,600
You hear "reasonable"
and "tortious interference."

1123
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:34,900
I hear "potential Brown
& Williamson lawsuit...

1124
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:37,900
jeopardizing the sale
of CBS to Westinghouse."

1125
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,400
I hear "Shut the segment down.
Cut Wigand loose.

1126
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:44,200
Obey orders and fuck off."
That's what I hear.

1127
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,200
<i>- You're exaggerating.</i>
- I am?

1128
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,000
You pay me
to go get guys like Wigand,

1129
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:53,000
to draw him out, to get him to trust
us, to get him to go on television.

1130
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:56,000
I do. I deliver him.
He sits. He talks.

1131
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:59,500
He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement.

1132
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:03,600
And he's only the key witness in the
biggest public health reform issue,

1133
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,800
maybe the biggest,
most expensive...

1134
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:08,700
corporate malfeasance case
in U.S. History.

1135
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:11,100
And Jeffrey Wigand,
who's out on a limb,

1136
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,500
does he go on television
and tell the truth?

1137
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,900
Yes.
Is it newsworthy?

1138
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,700
Yes.
Are we gonna air it?

1139
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,700
Of course not. Why?

1140
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:23,200
Because he's not
telling the truth? No.

1141
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:27,100
<i>Because he is telling the truth.</i>
<i>That's why we're not gonna air it.</i>

1142
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,400
And the more truth he tells,
the worse it gets.

1143
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:33,400
<i> You are a fanatic,</i>
<i>an anarchist. You know that?</i>

1144
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:37,100
If we can't have a whole show, then
I want half a show rather than no show.

1145
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,800
But, oh, no. Not you. You
won't be satisfied unless you're
putting the company at risk!

1146
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:44,100
What are you? Are you a businessman
or are you a newsman?

1147
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,500
Because that happens to be
what Mike and I...

1148
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,200
and some other people
around here do for a living.

1149
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:53,000
<i>- Lowell...</i>
- Put the corporation at risk?
Give me a fucking break!

1150
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:55,200
These people are
putting our whole reason...

1151
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:58,000
- for doing what we do on the line!
- Lowell!

1152
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,100
What?

1153
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,400
I'm with Don
on this.

1154
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,800
What's wrong?

1155
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,400
They're killing
the Wigand interview.

1156
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:33,800
- What?
- They're pretending it's process.
That's bullshit. It's foregone.

1157
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:39,000
What are you and Mike
gonna do?

1158
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:44,400
I'm alone on this.

1159
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,900
- Oh, baby.
- Yeah.

1160
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:19,100
It's Jeffrey Wigand.

1161
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:32,400
Jeffrey.
How are you?

1162
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,500
How's the family?
Okay?

1163
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,600
- There is... There is no family.
- What do you mean, "there is no family"?

1164
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,900
Uh, Liane has filed for divorce.

1165
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:43,400
And, so,
I've moved out.

1166
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,100
I see the girls
a couple of days a week.

1167
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:51,500
- Where are you staying now?
- Our favorite hotel, honey.

1168
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:55,600
I checked into room 930.

1169
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:57,700
Odd choice, huh?

1170
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,600
I don't know how
to say this,

1171
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:06,000
Jeff, except to just
say it right out.

1172
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:10,300
So, uh, I'll say it.
They do not want to air it.

1173
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:17,500
- What?
- B&W may have threatened litigation.

1174
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:20,100
CBS is on the block.

1175
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:23,300
- But you, I mean... I know how you...
- No.

1176
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:26,400
No, what?

1177
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:31,300
I do not think that you know for me
what it is to walk in my shoes.

1178
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,100
For my kids
to have seen it,

1179
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:39,200
for them to know why I've
put them through what I did.

1180
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:42,800
The public airing of that,
the testament to why I did what I did.

1181
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,800
You're telling me it's not
gonna see the light of day?

1182
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:48,600
Jeff.

1183
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:33,200
Mrs. Wigand?

1184
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,200
It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand
for some time.

1185
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:43,000
I'm an investigator, and I was
wondering if I could ask you a
couple of questions about that.

1186
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:46,700
All right.

1187
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,300
Um, seven months
after we were married,

1188
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:55,700
we found out that I had
multiple sclerosis.

1189
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,600
<i>And you had a daughter, Diane...</i>

1190
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,800
<i>Tommy Sandefur told me himself.</i>

1191
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:04,400
<i>He's not going to allow Brown</i>
<i>& Williamson to be demonized</i>
<i>to the American public.</i>

1192
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,400
So I told Pete Jennings.
And I... Hold on.

1193
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,100
You had multiple sclerosis.
You had a small child to raise.

1194
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:15,200
Uh, mention that part in the
executive summary and in the chapters.

1195
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,700
First wife
and estrangement of daughter.

1196
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:20,100
So I was telling Pete, I said,
"You've been taken in by this guy."

1197
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,900
The divorce was something
that we both wanted.

1198
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:26,700
He's a shoplifter.

1199
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:29,300
He's a convicted
shoplifter.

1200
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:51,100
So, um, what are you
gonna do?

1201
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,400
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Quit in protest?

1202
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,700
I'm not gonna do that.

1203
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,700
You're taking "no"
for an answer?

1204
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:01,800
No, I'm not gonna take
"no" for an answer. No.

1205
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,900
You're not?
What <i>are</i> you doing?

1206
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,500
I'm staying right here, doing my job.
Fighting to get my show on the air.

1207
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:11,300
You don't like it?
Hey, I tell you what?

1208
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:14,500
Fire my ass.

1209
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:18,200
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?

1210
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:25,200
I don't think so.
Take a look at this.

1211
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:28,200
This is a summary of a dossier
that's being prepared.

1212
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,500
He wouldn't lie
about his whole life.

1213
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:33,300
Who's gonna believe him
about anything he says?

1214
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:37,200
<i>The</i> Wall Street Journal <i>is doing</i>
<i>a major story, and, I think, the</i> Post.

1215
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,600
You backed the wrong horse.

1216
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:45,000
The version without the interview
is gonna air the week after next.

1217
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:53,700
What was that about?

1218
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,800
- Get me Wigand.
- Sure.

1219
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:02,600
What the fuck is this?
Fuck!

1220
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:05,000
You never told me
you were married before.

1221
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:08,300
- That you had a daughter.
- How is that any of your business?

1222
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:10,700
That is not something
that you people need to know.

1223
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,700
Oh, you know what we do
or do not need to know?

1224
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,200
- Since when have you become
a media expert?
- What do you wanna do, Lowell?

1225
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,600
- Look up my ass too?
- Oh, for God's sake.

1226
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:20,400
- You're not even on this anymore.
What do you care?
- Jeff, wake the fuck up!

1227
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:24,000
Everybody is on the line here.
If they catch you in a lie,

1228
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:26,900
they can paint everything with
that brush, you understand?

1229
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:29,400
- Everything you say.
- I told the truth.

1230
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:33,000
Everything you say.
And I can't defend you, man,

1231
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
with one hand tied
behind my back...

1232
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:37,700
because you keep from me
what they can discover.

1233
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:40,500
And they will discover
everything. Believe me.

1234
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,700
I was young!
I was young!

1235
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,800
Confused. We didn't
handle it the right way.

1236
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,800
- She sued you for back payments
of child support?
- She did not sue me.

1237
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:54,000
We had a dispute over money. I settled
it. She dropped the complaint.

1238
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
- Any other questions?
- Yes. Did you lie...

1239
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,300
about being on the American
judo team in the Olympics?

1240
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:01,400
- What?
- Some public relations guy...

1241
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:03,500
got hold of a tape of an interview
where you're saying...

1242
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:06,200
you were on the American
judo team in the Olympics.

1243
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:09,400
What kind of shit is this?
I... I was...

1244
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:12,900
I was not <i>on</i> the team.
I <i>sparred</i> with the Olympic team.

1245
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:16,100
- Okay?
- All right. ABC Telemarketing Company?

1246
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:19,800
- ABC...
- ABC Telemarketing Company.

1247
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:22,800
The can opener!
A 39.95 can opener!

1248
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:25,600
I cancelled payment.
It was junk!

1249
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,800
You ever bounce a check, Lowell?
You ever look at another woman's tits?

1250
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,100
You ever cheat a little
on your taxes?

1251
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:34,700
Whose life, if you look at it under
a microscope, doesn't have any flaws?

1252
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,300
Well, that's the whole point, Jeffrey.
That's the whole point.

1253
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:41,200
Anyone's, everyone's.
They are gonna look under every rock,

1254
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:45,200
dig up every flaw,
every mistake you've ever made.

1255
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:49,200
They are going to distort and exaggerate
everything you've ever done, man.

1256
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:52,000
- Don't you understand?
- What does this have to do
with my testimony?

1257
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:54,200
- That's not the point...
- What does it have to do
with my testimony?

1258
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:56,900
- I told the truth!
It's true and provable!
- It's not about...

1259
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,400
That's not the fucking point,
whether you told the truth or not!

1260
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:03,900
Hello?

1261
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,100
I told the truth.

1262
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:12,900
I told the truth.

1263
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,800
I gotta teach class. I gotta go.

1264
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:20,600
- I gotta teach class.
- And I gotta refute every
fucking accusation made...

1265
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:23,500
in this report before
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> runs.

1266
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,400
I am trying to protect you,
man.

1267
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:32,400
I hope you improve
your batting average.

1268
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:55,200
<i>They're cutting the interest rate,</i>
<i>and I have that great feature...</i>

1269
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:03,500
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1270
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:08,200
Are you guys planning to do a piece on
a former top executive in Big Tobacco?

1271
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:11,200
- You caught me in a news meeting.
- Are you, are you not, Charlie?

1272
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:13,200
You bet we are,
and I can't talk to you now.

1273
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:16,300
- We gotta hook up.
- Sure. Where?

1274
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:19,100
- P.J.'s.
- I'll be there.

1275
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,800
Yeah, I got it.
Five hundred pages of it.

1276
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:32,500
They looked in every corner
of this guy's life,
from the spousal abuse charge,

1277
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:36,400
to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket
he got once for running a red light.

1278
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:40,000
It's Terry Lenzner's outfit,
I.G.I. Jack, listen to me.

1279
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:44,700
Their strategy: Discredit
this guy, ruin his reputation
in the <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>

1280
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:48,100
and then nobody will ever listen
to what he's got to say about tobacco.

1281
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:51,200
He's dead unless I can
get this thing knocked down.

1282
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,700
Make it even
a little more attractive.

1283
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,400
I don't know if you're
ever gonna get paid.

1284
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:59,100
- Is there any truth to any of it?
- That's a good question.

1285
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:01,700
"Is there any truth to any of it?"
I doubt it.

1286
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:05,200
- What's the deadline?
- Soon.

1287
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:12,000
- Fax me the summary.
- That's great, Jack.

1288
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:22,200
- Hey. How are you? Hey, listen.
- Hey.

1289
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:25,500
I hear you guys are sitting
on something sensational over there.

1290
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:29,200
- Really? Hi, June.
- Oh, hi, baby.

1291
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:33,200
- Catch you later.
- Okay. Take care.

1292
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,900
- When's your deadline?
- Monday.

1293
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,900
- Push it.
- What? Forget it.

1294
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,900
It's a smear campaign,
Charlie.

1295
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,900
- It's drawn from
a selectively circulated...
- Oh, yeah.

1296
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Real selective. About as hard to get
ahold of as the Manhattan phone book.

1297
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:50,900
Well, it's authoritive...
and overwhelmingly documented.

1298
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
And it's bullshit. And if
I'm right, are you gonna put...

1299
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:57,100
the <i>Journal's</i> reputation behind a story
that's gonna blow up in your face?

1300
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:01,300
I'll take a look at what you got
but I'm not moving any deadlines
because you say so.

1301
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,700
Are you all right?

1302
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,900
Yeah.

1303
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:26,700
Officer Muravchick?

1304
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,800
Thank you.

1305
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:32,300
Officer Muravchick,
how are you?

1306
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,500
- I'm Sandra Sutherland.
- How do you do?

1307
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,600
Fine, thank you.
I'm doing a background check.

1308
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:38,500
Mind if I sit down?

1309
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:44,500
Your Honor,
could I have a word with you?

1310
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:48,300
You presided in a dispute
over support payments.

1311
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:51,700
Jeffrey Wigand?
Yeah, I cited him.

1312
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:55,900
CBS is under criticism because
the CBS News program, <i>60 Minutes,</i>

1313
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
will not be presenting
an interview...

1314
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:00,800
What the hell
are you doing?

1315
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:02,900
What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm editing.

1316
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,900
No, no, no that. I'm talking
about the Associated Press.

1317
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:10,500
They got the story that
we pulled this interview,
and they talked to Mike and I.

1318
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:12,600
Did you tell them
that we were lying?

1319
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:14,700
No!
I should have.

1320
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:16,900
I told them I disagreed
with you, Mike and Kluster...

1321
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:19,700
that this segment
is as good as the original.

1322
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,100
<i>I'm not lying for you.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna shut up for you.</i>

1323
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:25,000
<i>- Not on any of it.</i>
- Hey, I'm not gonna fire you.

1324
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,100
Okay? Take a vacation. Now!

1325
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:35,400
<i>Lowell? Look, I've decided</i>
<i>to preface Sunday's show.</i>

1326
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:38,200
I did three minutes on the
<i>Evening News.</i> You'll want to see it.

1327
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:41,300
- Where are you going?
- I've been banished...

1328
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:44,600
<i>in lieu of being fired.</i>

1329
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:47,700
<i>I took off on Tisch.</i>
<i>I took off on Corporate.</i>

1330
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:50,500
They'll know they're not, uh, going
to see everything on Sunday night.

1331
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:54,900
I don't know. How does that
get Wigand on the air?

1332
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:57,200
Do me a favor,
will you? Spare me.

1333
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:59,700
For God's sake, get in the
real world. What do you think?

1334
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:03,300
I'm going to resign in protest
to force it on the air?

1335
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:06,300
The answer's no. I don't plan
to spend the end of my days...

1336
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,400
wandering in the wilderness
of National Public Radio.

1337
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:11,400
That decision
I've already made.

1338
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:15,700
<i> This Sunday,</i>
<i>Wallace will broadcast a report...</i>

1339
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:20,100
<i>on the tobacco industry,</i>
<i>including the tough tactics</i>
<i>tobacco companies employ...</i>

1340
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:23,000
to keep a lid on information
that might be damaging.

1341
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:25,900
Is there information
that people should have...

1342
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:30,300
that they're not going to have
because you're not going to
broadcast this interview?

1343
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:34,400
- Yes.
- Today, CBS News president
Eric Kluster...

1344
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:37,300
<i>defended the network's decision</i>
<i>not to broadcast...</i>

1345
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:40,200
<i>key portions</i>
<i>of the controversial interview.</i>

1346
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,200
<i>Mr. Kluster said, quote,</i>
<i>"The atmosphere is tougher than ever."</i>

1347
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:45,900
- Where's the rest?
- Dan.

1348
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,900
Where the hell's the rest?

1349
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:50,900
<i>- Nebraska football</i>
<i>fans voiced their criticism...</i>
- You cut it!

1350
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,900
<i>Coming up in</i>
<i>Bernard Goldberg's America.</i>

1351
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
- You cut the guts out of what I said!
- It was a time consideration...

1352
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,800
Time? Bullshit!
You corporate lackey.

1353
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:03,700
Who told <i>you</i> your incompetent
little fingers have the
requisite skills to edit me?

1354
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,500
I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation
here, and you're too dim...

1355
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:08,900
Mike. Mike. Mike.

1356
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,100
"Mike"? Mike!

1357
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:14,900
Try "Mr. Wallace."

1358
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:18,800
We work in the same corporation. Doesn't
mean we work in the same profession.

1359
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:21,400
Now, now what are you going to do now?
You going to finesse me?

1360
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:25,800
Lawyer me some more? I've been
in this profession 50 fucking years!

1361
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,900
You and the people you work for
are destroying the most respected,

1362
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:31,800
the highest rated, the most
profitable show on this network.

1363
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,300
Here. These are
their leads, their sources.

1364
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:54,500
- I want you to have your reporters...
- Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

1365
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,800
Have them make
their own calls.

1366
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:01,700
They'll find that these sources
have a different story than
the one that's in the dossier.

1367
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,800
Push the deadline,
Charlie.

1368
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:14,400
I'll push it for a week.
I want Milo and Suein to go through it.

1369
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:30,700
What do you want
to buy him for a gift?

1370
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:34,600
<i>Mmm, he's into</i>
<i>kind of little cars that, um...</i>

1371
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:36,900
- That remote control thing?
- Yeah.

1372
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,300
All right.
We'll go do that tomorrow.

1373
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:43,700
<i> The 63-36 vote was three</i>
<i>shy of the two-thirds needed to pass...</i>

1377
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,100
And in local news,
WLKO, Louisville,

1378
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:56,700
has gained access
to a 500-page dossier...

02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:44,000
and the current head of the Food and
Drug Administration have been saying.

1389
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,600
We learned of a tobacco insider
who could tell us...

1390
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:50,700
<i>whether or not the tobacco industry</i>
<i>has been leveling with the public.</i>

1391
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:52,700
<i>That insider was formerly...</i>

1392
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:55,600
<i>a highly-placed executive</i>
<i>with a tobacco company.</i>

1393
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:59,500
<i>But we cannot broadcast what critical</i>
<i>information about tobacco,</i>

1394
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:03,000
<i>addiction and public health</i>
<i>he might be able to offer.</i>

1395
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,800
<i>Why? Because he had to sign</i>
<i>a confidentiality agreement...</i>

1396
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,400
<i>with the tobacco company</i>
<i>he worked for.</i>

1397
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:12,500
<i>The management of CBS</i>
<i>has told us...</i>

1398
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:14,700
<i>that knowing</i>
<i>he had that agreement...</i>

1399
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,200
<i>if we were to broadcast</i>
<i>an interview with him,</i>

1400
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:21,100
<i>CBS could be faced with</i>
<i>a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.</i>

1401
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:25,000
<i>The fact is, we are not allowed</i>
<i>even to mention his name...</i>

1402
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,800
or the name of the company
he worked for.

1403
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:32,200
And, of course, we cannot
show you his face.

1404
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:35,300
And your confidentiality
agreement with...

1405
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:38,000
- Is still in force?
- Yes, it is.

1406
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,200
<i>So what are they gonna do?</i>
<i>Sue you for making this appearance?</i>

1407
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:43,600
<i>I would bet on it.</i>

02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:11,700
Yeah.

1411
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:14,200
You disappeared on me.

1412
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:17,600
- How long you staying?
- I disappeared on you?

1413
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:20,400
All right.
What did you think?

1414
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:23,800
I think it was
a disgrace.

1415
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:51,200
- Still no answer.
- Get me the manager's office.

1416
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:54,600
David. David, you've got
a call on line four.

1417
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:57,800
I think you
better take it.

1418
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,700
This is David McDougal.
How can I help you?

1419
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:03,700
Mr. McDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.
I'm a producer for <i>60 Minutes.</i>

1420
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:09,100
I'm concerned for a friend of mine
who's staying at your hotel right now.

1421
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:18,000
Mr. Wigand?

1422
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,900
Mr. Wigand?

1423
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:28,700
I-I think I need to call the police.
He won't respond.

1424
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:31,600
No, no, don't call the police. Just
tell him I'm on the phone with you.

1425
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:34,100
My name is Lowell Bergman.
Just tell him that.

1426
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:38,600
Mr. Wigand, Mr. Bergman
is on the telephone.

1427
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:41,200
Did he hear you?

1428
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:43,500
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

1429
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:46,300
What about now?

1430
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,900
- What?
- Hello? Can you hear me now?

1431
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:00,500
- What's happening?
- He doesn't seem to be listening.

1432
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:04,500
All right. Now listen to me.
I want you... I want you to tell him...

1433
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,900
in these words:
Get on the fucking phone.

1434
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:09,300
I-I can't say that.

1435
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:11,900
No, you can. Tell him
to get on the fucking phone!

1436
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,100
He told me to tell you
to get on the... fucking phone!

1437
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:24,000
You manipulated me into this.

1438
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,200
- That's bullshit, Jeff.
- You greased the rails.

1439
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:30,400
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted
to say "yes." I helped him to say "yes."

1440
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:33,200
That's all.
You're not a robot, Jeff.

1441
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:36,200
- All right? You got a mind
of your own, don't you?
- " Up to you, Jeffrey.

1442
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:38,500
"That's the power you have,
Jeffrey.

1443
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:41,100
Vital inside information
the American public need to know."

1444
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:44,600
Lowell Bergman... the hotshot who never
met a source he couldn't turn around.

1445
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:46,900
I fought for you,
and I still fight for you!

1446
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:49,600
You fought for me?
You manipulated me...

1447
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:52,700
into where I am now... staring
at the Brown & Williamson building!

1448
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:56,000
It's all dark except the tenth floor.
That's the legal department.

1449
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,800
That's where they
fuck with my life.

1450
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Jeffrey, where you going
with this?

1451
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:09,400
So, where you going?

1452
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:16,500
You are... important...

1453
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,500
to a lot of people,
Jeffrey.

1454
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,600
You think about that.

1455
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:24,500
You think about them.

1456
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:40,100
I'm running out
of heroes, man.

1457
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:43,300
Guys like you
are in short supply.

1458
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:51,300
Yeah, guys like you too.

1459
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:58,300
Where are you, anyway?

1460
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:03,000
I'm on a leave of absence.
Forced vacation.

1461
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,200
- You try and have a good time.
- Yeah.

1462
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:10,600
Yeah, I will.

1463
02:11:24,700 --> 02:11:27,700
I'm Lowell Bergman. I'm from <i>60 Minutes.</i>
You know, you take the <i>60 Minutes...</i>

1464
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,500
out of that sentence,
nobody returns your phone calls.

1465
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:35,500
<i>Maybe Wigand's right.</i>
<i>Maybe I'm hooked.</i>

1466
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,800
What am I hooked on?

1467
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:41,100
The rush of <i>60 Minutes?</i>

1468
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:45,000
<i>What the hell for?</i>
<i>"Infotainment"!</i>

1469
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,300
It's so fucking useless,
all of it.

1470
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:51,100
So it's a big country with a free press.
You can go and work somewhere else.

1471
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:53,200
"Free press"?
The press is free.

1472
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:57,000
For anyone who owns one.
Larry Tisch has a free press.

1473
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:59,400
- Get some perspective, Lowell.
- I got perspective.

1474
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:01,300
No, you do not.

1475
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:05,300
From my perspective,

1476
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:09,300
what's been going on and what
I've been doing is ridiculous.

1477
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:11,700
- It's half-measures.
<i>- You're not listening.</i>

1478
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Really know what you're
going to do before you do it.

1479
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:04,800
<i>I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone.</i>

1480
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:07,800
Patch him through.

1481
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:10,700
Well, Lowell, you are
not gonna believe this.

1482
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:15,000
The governor of Mississippi
is suing his own attorney general...

1483
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:18,700
to abandon litigation
against Big Tobacco.

1484
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:22,700
- Oh, good.
- But now that the version
without Jeff ran,

1485
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:26,100
what's the chance of getting
his interview on the air?

1486
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:30,600
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1487
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:33,000
What chance is there of getting
Jeff's interview on the air?

1488
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:35,000
Less than great.

1489
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:42,100
I'd be lying to you
if I did not tell you...

1490
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:45,500
how important it was
in the court of public opinion.

1491
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:48,300
I'd be lying to you
if I didn't tell you...

1492
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:52,100
I'm about out of moves,
Dick.

1493
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:56,300
All right.
See ya.

1494
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:21,100
Hi.

1495
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:27,200
So, what are you folks
doing... here in Lincoln?

1496
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:32,300
- Geology survey.
- Geology?

1497
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:35,300
Yeah?
Really?

1498
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,400
How about you?

1499
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:41,300
I work for CBS News.

1500
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:44,000
Oh, yeah?

1501
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:13,800
Just ran into
two of your geologists.

1502
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:16,400
Geologists whose hands
aren't all chewed up.

1503
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:20,500
Lowell, do not...
screw this up.

1504
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,900
We are a week away
from an arrest.

1505
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,300
- So I'll hold it. And?
- We'll give you a heads-up
before we launch.

1506
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:30,000
- How long?
- Three hours.

1507
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
<i>You got a deal.</i>

1508
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:50,900
<i>... like the testimony before Congress</i>
<i>of Dr. Wigand's former boss,</i>

1509
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,800
<i>Brown & Williamson's chief</i>
<i>executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.</i>

1510
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:57,000
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

1511
02:15:57,200 --> 02:15:59,700
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

1512
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:03,300
- because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.
- All of us did.

1513
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:05,700
There was this
whole line of people,

1514
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:08,300
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

1515
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:11,500
Part of the reason I'm here
is that I felt...

1516
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:13,700
that their representation...

1517
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:45,100
...can be more rapidly absorbed
in the lung...

1518
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:47,300
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

1519
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,900
- Hello?
- Jim, it's Lowell.

1520
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,700
- Hey, where are you?
- Remember that night at P.J.'s?

1521
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:21,300
You asked me if we were
sitting on something explosive.
Well, we're not sitting on it.

1522
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:25,100
CBS Corporate leaned on CBS News,
which yanked an interview we did...

1523
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:29,000
with a top-ranking tobacco scientist,
corporate officer.

1524
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,300
They're trying to
close down the story.

1525
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:34,600
You mean, <i>60 Minutes</i>
is letting CBS Corporate...

1526
02:17:34,700 --> 02:17:37,100
decide what is
or is not news?

1527
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:39,800
What's Wallace think
about this? Or Hewitt, or...

1528
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:42,000
How prominent?
What kind of placement?

1529
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,500
Oh, come on, Lowell. This is
<i>The New York Times.</i> I don't know.

1530
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:49,800
Well, until you do, all I can
tell you is what you already know.

1531
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:51,700
They will not
air an interview.

1532
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:54,300
Call me back in ten.

1533
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:04,400
- Hello?
- Debbie, it's me.

1534
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,900
Hi.
What time is it?

1535
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
- Oh, it's late.
- That I know. When are you coming back?

1536
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:13,900
I can't get out of here till
mid-morning. I'll be in tomorrow night.

1537
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:17,600
Listen, could you call a number
for me? It's in Mississippi.

1538
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:19,600
Okay.
Hold on a second.

1539
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
What is it?

1540
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:31,800
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

1541
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:35,900
All right, Lowell. Page one.
Editorial's interested. Let's talk.

1542
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,400
Here's how it works. You ask me
questions. I tell you if you're wrong.

1543
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:44,700
- Lowell, you sure you want to do this?
- Why?

1544
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:48,300
Hey, it doesn't work,
you've burned your bridges, man.

1545
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:50,500
You ready?

1546
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:53,300
Okay.
About this whistle-blower,

1547
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:56,000
did Mike and Don go along
with the corporate decision?

1548
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:02,900
- Lowell?
- Did I tell you you were wrong?

1549
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:06,900
No. Um, I'm assuming
the cave-in begins...

1550
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:09,500
with the threat of litigation
from Big Tobacco.

1551
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:12,000
Are we talking, uh...

1552
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:15,000
Are we talking
Brown & Williamson here?

1553
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:49,900
Did I get you up?

1554
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:54,000
No, I usually sit around
my hotel room dressed like this
at 5:30 in the morning,

1555
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
sleepy look on my face.

1556
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
How many shows have
we done? Huh?

1557
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:02,200
- Come on. How many?
- Oh, lots.

1558
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:04,100
That's right.

1559
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:08,600
But in all that time,
Mike,

1560
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:11,500
did you ever get off a plane,
walk into a room...

1561
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:16,600
and find that a source
for a story changed his mind?

1562
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:19,100
Lost his heart?
Walked out on us?

1563
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,900
Not one fucking time.
You wanna know why?

1564
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,500
I see a rhetorical question
on the horizon.

1565
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:26,500
I'm gonna tell you why.

1566
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:30,000
Because when I tell someone
I'm gonna do something, I deliver.

1567
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:34,200
Oh, how fortunate I am to have
Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage...

1568
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:36,900
- to point me down the shining
path, to show me the way.
- Oh, please, Mike.

1569
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:39,400
- Give me a break.
- You give me a break.

1570
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:42,500
I never left a source
hung out to dry <i>ever.</i>

1571
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:45,600
Abandoned.
Not till right fucking now.

1572
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,300
When I came on this job,
I came with my word intact.

1573
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:53,400
I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
Fuck the rules of the game!

1574
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:55,400
Hell, you're supposed
to know me, Mike.

1575
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:57,500
What the hell
did you expect?

1576
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,300
You expect me to lie down?

1577
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:03,300
Back off?
Or get over it?

1578
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:07,500
In the real world, when you get to where
I am, there are other considerations.

1579
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:10,800
Like what?
Corporate responsibility?

1580
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,200
- What, are we talking celebrity here?
- I'm not...

1581
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:17,200
I'm not talking about
celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm...

1582
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:19,100
I'm...
I'm talking about...

1583
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:23,400
when you're nearer the end
of your life than the beginning.

1584
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:27,300
And what do you think
you think about then? The future?

1585
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,900
"In the future, I'm gonna
do this, become that"?

1586
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,200
What future? No.

1587
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:35,100
What you think is...

1588
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:37,700
"How will I be regarded
in the end...

1589
02:21:37,900 --> 02:21:41,500
after I'm gone?"

1590
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:45,600
Oh, along the way, I suppose
I made some minor impact.

1591
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:49,700
I did Irangate,
the Ayatollah, Malcolm X,

1592
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:52,500
Martin Luther King,
Saddam, Sadat, etc., etc.

1593
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:57,300
I showed them thieves in suits.
I spent a lifetime building...

1594
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:59,200
all that.

1595
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:06,200
But history only remembers most
what you did last.

1596
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:09,400
And should that be
fronting a segment...

1597
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:13,300
that allowed a tobacco giant
to crash this network...

1598
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:22,000
Does it give someone...

1599
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:27,400
at my time of life pause?

1600
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:29,400
Yeah.

1601
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:38,300
Mike,

1602
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
in my...

1603
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:47,300
You and I
have been doing this...

1604
02:22:47,300 --> 02:22:51,200
together for 14 years.

1605
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:55,700
This is today's
<i>New York Times.</i>

1606
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:57,900
In it is the whole
sordid story...

1607
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,600
of what went on
inside our shop.

1608
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:06,300
And in the editorial,
it accuses us...

1609
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:09,300
of betraying the legacy
of Edward R. Murrow.

1610
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:37,300
They conclude most of it
seems pretty unsubstantiated.

1611
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,300
You're full of shit,
John.

1612
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,000
Yeah.

1613
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:03,800
<i>Front page. There's a picture of Wigand.</i>

1614
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:05,800
<i>Article's entitled,</i>
<i>"Getting Personal."</i>

1615
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:07,800
Byline to Suein Hwang
and Milo Geyelin.

1616
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,400
Wait. Hold on
a second, Lowell.

1617
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,300
Yeah.

1618
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:19,400
Yeah, I'll see
if I can find him.

1619
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:22,600
Yeah, hold on.
Don's looking for you.

1620
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:26,100
- Good.
- The subheading
is " Brown & Williamson...

1621
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:29,400
has a 500-page dossier
attacking chief critic."

1622
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:31,900
It quotes Richard Scruggs
calling it the worst kind...

1623
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:35,200
of an organized smear campaign
against a whistle-blower.

1624
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:38,700
"A close look at the file
and independent research
by this newspaper...

1625
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:42,200
"into its key claim indicates
that many of the serious allegations...

1626
02:24:42,300 --> 02:24:47,600
against Mr. Wigand are backed by
scant or contradictory evidence."

1627
02:25:06,900 --> 02:25:09,600
<i>This news division has been vilified...</i>

1628
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:12,500
in <i>The New York Times,</i>
in print, on television...

1629
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:14,500
for caving
to corporate interests!

1630
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:18,500
<i>The New York Times</i> ran a
blow-by-blow of what we talked
about behind closed doors.

1631
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:21,500
- You fucked us!
- No! You fucked you!

1632
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,600
Don't invert stuff.

1633
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:26,400
Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand.
You bought it.

1634
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:29,300
The <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>
here... not exactly...

1635
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:32,200
a bastion of
anti-capitalist sentiment,

1636
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:34,800
refutes Big Tobacco's
smear campaign...

1637
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:38,300
as the lowest form
of character assassination.

1638
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:40,300
And now, even now,
when every word...

1639
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:43,400
of what Wigand has said
on our show is printed,

1640
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:47,100
the entire deposition
of his testimony in a court of law...

1641
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:49,300
in the state of Mississippi,
the cat...

1642
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:52,100
<i>totally</i> out of the bag,

1643
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:54,200
you're still
standing here debating.

1644
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:58,700
<i>Don, what the hell else</i>
<i>do you need?</i>

1645
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:01,000
Mike, you tell him.

1646
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:03,100
You fucked up, Don.

1647
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:13,400
It's old news. Stick with me,
like always. We'll be okay.

1648
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:16,600
These things have
a half-life of 15 minutes.

1649
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:20,700
No, that's fame.
Fame has a 15-minute half-life.

1650
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,800
Infamy lasts
a little longer.

1651
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:28,000
<i>We caved. It's foolish.</i>
<i>It's simply dead wrong.</i>

1652
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,900
Now this is what we're going to do.
We're going over to Black Rock...

1653
02:26:35,700 --> 02:26:40,100
Okay? So let's get back to work.
Now what we saw there...

1654
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:42,800
<i>was two potassium chlorate...</i>

1655
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:48,100
would yield two potassium
chloride, also a solid...

1656
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:02,500
They cancelled the 6:00.
I don't know why. I...

1657
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:06,200
I'm on the 8:10.
I should be home... 9:30.

1658
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,900
I'll see you then.
I love you. Bye.

1659
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:25,100
- Oh. Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks.

1660
02:27:37,700 --> 02:27:39,700
CBS management wouldn't
let us broadcast...

1661
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:43,300
our original story and our
interview with Jeffrey Wigand...

1662
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:45,600
because they were worried
about the possibility...

1663
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:48,600
of a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit against us...

1664
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:51,100
<i>for tortious interference.</i>

1665
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,200
<i>But now things have changed.</i>

1666
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:56,100
<i>What Dr. Wigand told us</i>
<i>was that his former...</i>

1667
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:28,200
<i> This industry,</i>
<i>in my opinion, is an industry...</i>

1668
02:28:28,300 --> 02:28:32,300
that has perpetrated the biggest fraud
on the American public in history.

1669
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:34,500
They've killed millions
and millions of...

1670
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:00,800
<i>You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?</i>

1671
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:05,300
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

1672
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:10,600
There are times I feel com...
compelled to do it.

1673
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:12,600
If you ask me...

1674
02:29:12,700 --> 02:29:15,600
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

1675
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:20,400
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

1676
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,800
I promised you a three-hour
heads up. Here it is.

1677
02:29:29,900 --> 02:29:33,400
Have a camera crew standing by
in Helena, Montana on Tuesday,

1678
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:35,400
and I'll give you
a three-hour head start.

1679
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:38,800
All right? By the way, that was
a hell of a good show tonight.

1680
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:40,900
- Thank you, Bill.
- Yeah.

1681
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:03,500
You won.

1682
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:05,500
Yeah.

1683
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:10,800
What did I win?

1684
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:18,900
<i> Reporting</i>

Thanks for this.

You know, we beat everybody.
ABC, NBC, CNN.

1692
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,900
Mike.

1693
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:03,800
That Canada story...

1694
02:31:03,900 --> 02:31:05,800
still interest you?

1695
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Everything interests me.

1696
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Uh, I quit, Mike.

1697
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:16,400
Bullshit.

1698

Come on.

1699
02:31:20,900 --> 02:31:23,400
It all worked out.

1700
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:26,200
You came out okay
in the end.

1701
02:31:26,300 --> 02:31:28,300
I did?

1702
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:31,500
What do I tell a source
on the next tough story?

1703
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:34,600
"Hang in with us.
You'll be fine. Maybe."

1704
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:37,500
No.

1705
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:40,600
What got broken here...

1706
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:43,000
doesn't go
back together again.

1707
02:31:47,900 --> 02:31:50,300
So, uh...
