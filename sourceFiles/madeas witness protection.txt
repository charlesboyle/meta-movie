1
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,050
Yeah, Walter. Hi, it's George.

2
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,886
I know it's my third call on a Saturday,

3
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,973
but I'm having a bit of a problem
with the Lockwise Helping Hand account.

4
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,268
Now, I know it's your baby,
and I know you'll straighten it out,

5
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:28,648
but, well, I'm thinking of heading into
the office today to see if I can sort it out.

6
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,984
So, no problems. We'll see you on Monday.

7
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,947
Don't worry about it.
Give my Iove to Rebecca. Bye-bye.

8
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,284
- Barbara, stop it.
- No.

9
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,537
- You need this.
- No, I will not.

10
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,996
George!

11
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,915
George, yes. Where is George?

12
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,042
- I would Iike to speak to him.
- I don't know.

13
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,586
I don't even know who you are, young Iady.

14
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,214
- George.
- Thank God.

15
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,716
George, who is this young Iady?

16
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,094
- Here, honey.
- That's...

17
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,971
I can't do this.

18
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,597
That's my wife, Mom.

19
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,475
No. She's too young.

20
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,269
How old is she?

21
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,020
We were married nine years ago, remember?

22
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,730
She's nine years old?

23
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,317
Our marriage is nine years old,
our marriage.

24
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,740
She's the second one.

25
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,536
No. I adored the other one.

26
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,414
I know, Mom, but,
you know, she tried to kill me.

27
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,958
No, she didn't.
That was just a Iittle hit-and-run.

28
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,752
Yeah, well, I was in traction for two months.

29
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,754
I don't remember that.

30
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,633
- Here you go.
- I Iike this one.

31
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,595
- Well, that's the most popular one.
- Yeah.

32
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,471
There you go.

33
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,478
- We aren't done with this.
- Yes, I know. I know.

34
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,231
And why are you wearing a shirt and tie
on a Saturday?

35
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,108
I have to go into the office.

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,277
- You're going into the office?
- Yes.

37
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,029
- When?
- Now.

38
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,115
George, aren't you forgetting something?

39
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,118
No, I'm not.

40
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,454
I Iove you.

41
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,624
Nice try. Your son.

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,252
You promised him you would take him
to his baseball game today.

43
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,339
I'm not telling him this time. You do it.

44
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:21,010
Honey, I'll be back in time.
The game doesn't start until 2:00.

45
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,136
1 :00.

46
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,430
I'll be back.

47
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,808
Mom, Dad, Grandma isn't eating.

48
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,480
God, I hate old people.

49
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,315
Watch your mouth, young Iady.

50
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,276
Why? It's not Iike she understands
anything we're saying.

51
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,029
You know what? I've had
just about enough of your attitude.

52
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,199
Hello? You Iistening?

53
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,161
iPod. They were made
to ignore the stepmother.

54
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,245
George?

55
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,332
Honey, would you take those things off,
please, and Iisten to your mother?

56
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,669
Okay, she is not my mother.

57
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,004
She's the mother of that thing.

58
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,881
- You're the thing.
- You're a thing.

59
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,634
- You're a thing, sister.
- Don't call me that.

60
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,680
Dad, I'm really excited
about the game today.

61
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,140
It's gonna be so cool having you there.

62
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,853
Jeremy's dad is always there,
but he yells at me if I miss the ball.

63
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,980
Well, that's not gonna happen today, son.

64
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,691
Now, I've got to run to the office,

65
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,360
but I'll be back in time
to take you to your game.

66
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,778
You promise?

67
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,698
Scout's honor.

68
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:29,787
Don't forget. I:00.

69
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,955
He's not coming.

70
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,208
That was the Star Trek sign.

71
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,876
He's a Trekkie.

72
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,878
And so am I.

73
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,742
- Morning, Jackie.
- Hello.

74
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,244
Don't you wish it was this quiet every day?

75
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,538
Be careful what you wish for.

76
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,888
Gotta be mine

77
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,561
Gotta be strong

78
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,731
A Iittle while

79
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,526
And you got nothing to be guilty of

80
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,528
You might not wanna sing that song.

81
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,039
Okay. Shred everything.

82
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,333
My shredder's broken.
I need another shredder!

83
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,793
- Here we go!
- Who's got one?

84
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,127
Don't Ieave any evidence. Nothing. Okay?

85
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,879
- Put 'em in a box!
- Let me through. Let me through.

86
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,799
Shred everything! Here, here. Right here!

87
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,929
AII the boxes!

88
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,433
AII right. Grab those two!
What are you doing?

89
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,436
Just get it in here! Anything!

90
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,649
I got one more!

91
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,567
- Is it the Iast quarter?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,987
Dump everything!

93
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,157
George, come in here, buddy.

94
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,952
Come in, come in, come in.

95
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,829
Walter, what's going on?

96
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,831
Hey, Iisten, pull your money out of the bank,

97
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,583
cash in all your stocks and bonds
by 10:00 a.m. Monday morning.

98
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,126
Why?

99
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,713
Well, CNN is doing
one of those investigative reports

100
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,507
about Lockwise Industries.

101
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,845
That's fantastic.
That'll be great for business.

102
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,807
Not really. They're gonna say we've been
running a Ponzi scheme for seven years.

103
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,520
Well, they can't say that, Walter.
That's Iibelous.

104
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,357
I mean, this firm's been operating
successfully for over 100 years.

105
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,152
Yeah, yeah, they're focusing
on the charity division, Helping Hands.

106
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,281
Helping Hands has been going strong
for over eight years.

107
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,699
I should know. I'm CFO.

108
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,034
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

109
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,412
Could you say that again,
the part about the CFO?

110
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,540
I'm CFO. I should know.

111
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,834
Right. Perfect, perfect. Thanks.

112
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,672
Walter, are they reporting
that it's our division?

113
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,507
Yeah. Your division.

114
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,509
But I have all the records.

115
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,928
Say that again.

116
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,973
But I have all the records.

117
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,017
Perfect. Now shred them.

118
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,894
- Walter.
- Yeah.

119
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,937
What are you saying?

120
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,981
I'm saying that all the monies

121
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:48,903
that came into Lockwise Industries'
Helping Hands charity investment group

122
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,196
are part of a big, old Ponzi scheme.

123
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,324
What?

124
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,284
Yeah. Christ.

125
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,828
It worked for a while.

126
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,789
I almost feel bad for hanging
you out to dry Iike this.

127
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,584
You should see your face, dude.

128
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,463
And by the way,
this is not gonna be pretty for you.

129
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,548
I feel awful.

130
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,883
Horrible.

131
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,509
What? But...

132
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,261
For me?

133
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,597
You were a Iowly accountant, remember?

134
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,476
And then I pull you out of bookkeeping
and make you the CFO.

135
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,687
I mean, you had no experience
whatsoever. None. None at all.

136
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:27,483
I had worked here five years
prior to that, Walter.

137
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,488
- I was working hard. I thought I earned it.
- You did work hard.

138
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,408
Nobody earns it around here.
I had to bang my way to the top.

139
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,036
And there's a Iot of big women
on the Board of Directors here.

140
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,164
And that was hard,
and it was hard to stay hard.

141
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,875
So don't talk to me about "hard."

142
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:50,047
Okay? You were paid a seven-figure salary
for exactly this reason.

143
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,924
What reason?

144
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,971
So you could take the fall.
Man, you've been paid to be screwed.

145
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,264
Kind ofjealous. Oh, well.

146
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,268
Walter, I knew nothing about this.

147
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,729
Yeah, I know. I know. Sorry.

148
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,524
Would have ruined it if you had, kind of.

149
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,071
Well, that explains why I couldn't get
those accounts to balance.

150
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,739
Now you're thinking.

151
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,994
What about the charities?
Walter, 82 charities.

152
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,704
They think their monies are safe.

153
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,914
I'm handing you over to the Feds,

154
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,835
and all you care about
is the stupid charities?

155
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,671
By the way, there's only 12 charities.

156
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,966
There's 82 charities.

157
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:38,595
No, there's 12. The other 70 companies
were set up by the Malone family.

158
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,098
Awkward.

159
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,768
The Mafia Malones?

160
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,271
You've been Iaundering money, dude.

161
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,107
Yeah, this is gonna be really awful for you.

162
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,193
Hey, man, be careful
when you start your car.

163
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,532
This is not happening.

164
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,536
A Ponzi scheme? A Ponzi scheme?

165
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,374
Walter, where are the investors' monies?

166
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,254
Walter? Walter!

167
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:25,726
Okay, calm down. Calm, calm, calm.
Calm down.

168
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,686
That's it. That's it.

169
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,564
Just calm down.

170
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,943
I'm not calming. I'm not calming.
I'm not calming.

171
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,669
- Hey, boss, just the person I wanna see.
- What do you have?

172
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,339
So I've been Iooking
into the Malone crime family, right?

173
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,423
And the more I Iook at them,

174
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,175
I'm finding that they're connected
to this company

175
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,677
that does a Iot of charity
investment work, called Lockwise.

176
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,762
Yes?

177
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,764
I think they may be
Iaundering money through them.

178
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,266
- We've been after these guys for years.
- Yeah.

179
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,435
Why don't you see
what you can find out, okay?

180
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,853
Okay.

181
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,438
Thanks a Iot.

182
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,668
George?

183
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,258
I've been calling you for hours.

184
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,012
Yeah, I know. I know.

185
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,722
How is he?

186
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,350
- He was upset, but he'll be fine.
- That's good.

187
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,269
Is it true?

188
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,271
What?

189
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,191
Come on, George.
Don't play games with me.

190
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,943
AII the wives were talking about it
at the field today.

191
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,863
Honey,

192
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,326
I swear I had no idea this was going on.

193
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,410
Okay? None.

194
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,496
I walked into the office,
and there's Walter, and he's saying,

195
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,374
"Why don't you shred stuff?
Shred whatever you have.

196
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,668
"Shred what's in your desk.
Just shred everything."

197
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,378
And I'm going, "What's going on?"

198
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,380
And he's saying,
"You're gonna take the fall for this,

199
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,509
"because it's a Ponzi scheme.
It's a Ponzi scheme, and you're the one.

200
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,012
"You're going down,
'cause you're the CFO."

201
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:12,059
You know? I mean, they gave
Bernie Madoff 200 years, honey.

202
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,229
What do you think they're gonna do to me?
What do you think they're gonna do?

203
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,190
And what's gonna happen with the kids?
What's gonna happen?

204
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,734
Howie's afraid, you know,
"Dad, you missed a game."

205
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,111
I'm gonna miss 38 seasons.

206
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,614
Sweetheart, I'm in trouble.

207
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,910
- Calm down.
- Okay.

208
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,248
- We need to get a Iawyer.
- A Iawyer.

209
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,625
And then you need to go to your mom's

210
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,460
and go find your mom's Valium.

211
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,504
Get a Valium out of my mom's purse.

212
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,881
- Okay. Can you do that? Like right now.
- Okay.

213
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,591
And you need to calm down.

214
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,885
- Honey.
- It's gonna be okay.

215
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,470
- It will be. It will be.
- Yes.

216
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,765
You know, minimum security.
It's not that bad.

217
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,184
Hey, Madea.

218
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,938
Hey, Lorraine, how you doing?
Good to see you.

219
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,279
Lord, it's a zoo up in there
on the first of the month.

220
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,790
Excuse me, ma'am. You wanna take this?
I don't feel Iike taking it back.

221
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,251
Thank you so much.
It's crazy up in there. Be careful.

222
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,461
They ain't taking that EBT card.
They stopped taking that.

223
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,547
I got to go somewhere else that take that.

224
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,134
Yeah, I got to go burn up my EBT card.

225
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:40,939
Give me your money.

226
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,526
That's a cute Iittle gun you got, boy.
Get out this car.

227
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,906
Lady, I will stab and shoot you.
Give me your money.

228
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,159
Son, I'm gonna tell you this one time, okay?

229
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,786
I want you to get out of this car
and go on about your business.

230
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,204
Go get you a job.

231
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,999
You ain't supposed to be stealing
from nobody working as hard as I...

232
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,251
What the hell you got to come over here
and steal from the poor for?

233
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,129
Get out the car. This is your warning, son.
Get out the car. Now, go on.

234
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,881
Then give me your money!

235
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,217
I worked for years to get my Social Security.
Now, I finally got it.

236
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,427
I ain't on no fixed income.

237
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,220
I'm on a broke income,
'cause I'm broke as hell.

238
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,805
Now, I want you
to get the hell out of this car.

239
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,392
This is your chance. Get out of the car, son.
Go on, now. Go get you a job.

240
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,895
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
old woman.

241
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,355
I'm gonna tell you one more time.

242
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:26,026
Look here! Get out of this car.
Go find you a job. Do you understand me?

243
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,779
They got people all over the world
that is working hard,

244
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,281
and y'all young thugs gonna come
try to take money from somebody.

245
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,116
That makes me mad.
Now, you about to make me mad.

246
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,202
You about to piss me off.
Now, get on out the car, son.

247
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,912
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Okay.

248
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:41,792
One, two, three.

249
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,128
Four.

250
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,547
Five.

251
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,343
I thought you was gonna count to three.
Son. Son, son, Iet me tell you something.

252
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,303
Get out the car
and go on about your business.

253
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,765
Now, this is your Iast chance.
This is your Iast chance. Now I got to go.

254
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:01,395
One more time. One, two...

255
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,729
Three!

256
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,112
Let's go this way.

257
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,823
Put your seat belt on.
You need a car seat?

258
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,783
Come get my money!

259
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,619
Trying to take my damn money
that I worked this hard for.

260
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,580
Lady!

261
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,290
I don't got insurance, Iady!

262
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,793
Slow down! Slow down!

263
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,504
You're screaming
straight up Iike a Iittle biatch!

264
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,755
I want to go home!

265
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,303
You want the money? You come get it.
I come get the money.

266
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,305
- I'm a real thug! I'm a real thug!
- You crazy!

267
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,849
Oh, my God!

268
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,479
Jake!

269
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,107
I'm sorry. Take it.

270
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,736
Hey, what do you got?

271
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,072
Well, just got off the phone with the SEC,

272
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:58,368
and it seems that this Lockwise charity
is definitely a Ponzi scheme.

273
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,162
COO, one Walter Burns.

274
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,789
CFO, George Needleman.
Never heard of him.

275
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,124
Let's arrest them both.

276
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,042
Well, it turns out
that Burns is on a private jet,

277
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,337
according to the FAA, to Europe.
Took off five hours ago.

278
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,674
So I'm sure he's gonna fight extradition.
But our boy, George, now...

279
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,801
Boy George? I Iove Boy George.

280
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,305
Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon

281
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,517
You come and go
You come and go

282
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,643
Sir?

283
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,854
Sorry.

284
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,483
George Needleman? Our guys should be
knocking at his door at any minute.

285
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,775
Great.

286
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,445
Well, it'd be great if we could get him
to testify against the Malones,

287
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,571
but that may be a tall order.

288
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,865
Okay, but no deal for him.

289
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,368
Look, I'm tired of these people
sticking it to the poor.

290
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,661
Sir, if we don't offer him a deal,

291
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,040
what incentive does he have
to testify against the mob?

292
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,666
It's very simple, Brian.

293
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,836
If he testifies,
the Malones will probably kill him.

294
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,465
If he doesn't,
he goes to prison for the rest of his Iife.

295
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,175
It's a win-win.

296
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,345
Sir, I think we should consider...

297
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,013
No, you don't. I want him fried.

298
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,850
Now, get our agents there
before the Malone family gets to him.

299
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,812
Yes, sir.

300
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,191
Hi, it's George Needleman
calling for Jeffrey.

301
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,361
Yes, I'll hold.

302
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,031
Where are my car keys?

303
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,658
You don't drive anymore, Barbara.

304
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,243
I know that.

305
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,828
Dad, I wish you could have
been there today.

306
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,956
Honey, your dad was very busy.

307
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,541
You suck.
You should probably just give it up.

308
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,751
No, I don't.

309
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,253
Yes, you do.

310
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,421
And I just tweeted that.

311
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,340
- Dad!
- Howie, stop.

312
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,593
Your dad's on the phone. Eat your dinner.

313
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,345
Okay, thank you.

314
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,065
What'd he say?

315
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,195
Well, his secretary said
that he would recommend an attorney,

316
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,948
but that he didn't wanna represent me.

317
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,867
After all those years of business with him?

318
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:03,994
Yeah.

319
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,203
What about Jeffrey?

320
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,082
Nobody's returning my calls.

321
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,585
Has anyone seen my car keys?

322
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,255
Mom, you don't drive anymore.

323
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,008
Is it Hanukkah?

324
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,509
No, it's not Hanukkah.

325
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:25,181
Yes, it is. That's why that nice young man
asked me to deliver this package to George.

326
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,602
And it's a Iong drive,
and so I need my car keys.

327
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,689
Mom, who gave you this?

328
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,358
In the backyard,

329
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:39,446
this man with a shiny, black suit
and black, shiny hair.

330
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,082
George, there's a note.

331
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,714
"You tock from me."

332
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,299
"Take," honey. That says "take."

333
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,968
No, I think that's "tock," honey. T-O-C-K.

334
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,386
Just read it.

335
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,722
Well, the man obviously
needs a spelling Iesson,

336
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,057
not to mention his grammar.

337
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,975
Can we open the present now?

338
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,144
Mom, you know what? Let's not open this.

339
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,312
No, this is ridiculous.

340
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,563
Oh, my God!

341
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,233
- It's a dead rat.
- I know.

342
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,444
What does this mean?

343
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,447
AII rats die.

344
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,327
Oh, my God. George.

345
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,128
Don't move. Just stay here, okay?

346
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,756
Don't move.

347
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,592
Stay here.

348
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,264
George Needleman?

349
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,724
Yes.

350
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,018
FBI. You're under arrest.

351
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,937
No!

352
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,652
I can't believe this.

353
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,989
You can't make bail.
Your accounts are frozen, George.

354
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,326
Well, here's the thing.

355
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,498
I haven't done anything wrong.
I just wanna go home.

356
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,208
That's not gonna happen.

357
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,627
The Malone family
is trying to kill you, George.

358
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,506
We've been given orders
to keep you protected.

359
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,425
What does that mean?

360
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,552
It means you and your family
are coming with us.

361
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,266
We have a problem with Needleman.

362
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,517
What happened?

363
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,643
I think Malone's boys know

364
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,687
that we're gonna offer him a chance
to testify against them,

365
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,855
so they sent their signature.

366
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,064
Is he all right?

367
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,816
Yeah, we're getting him out of there now.

368
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,318
Good, I'll get on the phone
with the US Marshals right away...

369
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,613
No, no. No, no. They can't go
into one of our regular safe houses.

370
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,366
The Malones have penetrated
our guys before.

371
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,166
We need to move him some place safe, now

372
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:54,109
Good idea. What do you suggest?

373
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:56,278
I don't know,
but first thing tomorrow morning,

374
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:57,529
they're on a plane headed here.

375
00:22:57,614 --> 00:23:01,074
You figure it out and tell no one.
Not even me.

376
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:04,161
Sir, I've got kids at my house.

377
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:05,871
I don't know what I would do
with a whole family of...

378
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:08,373
I don't know. You've been
a prosecutor for over a year.

379
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,627
This is a big case for you, Brian. Handle it.

380
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:39,503
Jake.

381
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:41,922
What you doing here?

382
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:46,135
You know, I'm just helping your auntie out.

383
00:23:46,386 --> 00:23:47,553
What'd you do?

384
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:49,221
I tried to rob her.

385
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,557
Boy, what is wrong with you?
I thought you gave up the gang banging.

386
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,517
- What the hell?
- I'm in trouble.

387
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:57,646
My dad put me in charge of
the church's mortgage payoff fundraiser.

388
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,106
I think I may have lost the money.

389
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:00,607
How?

390
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,902
I invested in some company,
and now they won't return my calls.

391
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:05,612
Jake, come on, man.

392
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:07,448
I know, and he's gonna kill me!

393
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:08,907
He just wanted
to pay the church's mortgage off

394
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,576
so that he could retire in peace.

395
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,662
Look what I did. And he's so sick.

396
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:17,166
I mean, those people at the church told him
not to make me trustee of the money.

397
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,002
But you know what my dad did?
"What your dad did, Jake?"

398
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:22,671
My dad went up there and told them
I was a changed man!

399
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:23,839
You know what else he said?

400
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,757
He said, "Everybody deserves
a second chance."

401
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:27,301
- Calm down, man.
- You know? He said, "Everybody."

402
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:28,469
- Jake. Jake.
- He did that for me.

403
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:30,971
- And you know what?
- Hey, hey, hey.

404
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:33,265
Calm down before Madea comes out
and slaps the hell out of you.

405
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,020
Look, Brian, I need you to help me
get this money back from Lockwise.

406
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:41,231
Lockwise Industries? New York?

407
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:42,608
Yeah.

408
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,362
That is a Ponzi scheme, man.

409
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,907
I don't know how I can help you
get any money back from there.

410
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:51,200
We're investigating them.

411
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:54,536
A Iot of people invest in these companies,
and those guys live this lavish lifestyle.

412
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:56,663
They spend all the money,
so there is no money.

413
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:58,290
And whatever the government can find,

414
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:01,502
maybe it's pennies on the dollar
that they can get back to the investors.

415
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,754
I don't know how I can help you, man.

416
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:07,591
Brian, I got to get this money back.

417
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,009
How much money you talking?

418
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:12,763
$114,000.

419
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:17,643
You were robbing Madea? Madea doesn't
have that kind of money. What were you...

420
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:21,813
Jake, don't tell me you were gonna rob
a bunch of old women.

421
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:26,818
How many little old ladies you think
you gonna have to rob to get $114,000?

422
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:30,113
114,000.

423
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:32,407
Boy, get your ass off my porch
and go home!

424
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:33,909
Yes, ma'am!

425
00:25:35,787 --> 00:25:37,829
Help me get this money back.

426
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:41,875
Oh, man. Auntie Madea, man.

427
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:43,669
What am I doing?

428
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:46,004
Hey, hey, Madea.

429
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,215
Hey, Brian. Hey, Brian.

430
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,633
Hey.

431
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:50,968
I don't know why the hell
you go in the bathroom

432
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:52,261
and leave the toilet seat up, Mabel.

433
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:53,720
Hey, Daddy.

434
00:25:53,805 --> 00:25:55,180
Do I know you?

435
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:58,392
I'm past 18 now. You can stop pretending
like you don't know me,

436
00:25:58,476 --> 00:25:59,560
so you don't have to pay child support.

437
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:02,646
Hey, son. How you doing?
I Iove you so much. So good to see you.

438
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,565
You want something to eat?
I'm making a sandwich for Joe.

439
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:07,901
I wouldn't eat that, son.
I wouldn't eat that at all.

440
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:10,737
I believe she be trying to kill me
for my insurance money.

441
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:12,823
You ain't got no insurance money.

442
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:16,076
In that case, I'm gonna eat this sandwich
she done made.

443
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,744
I'm not trying to kill you
for no insurance money.

444
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:18,829
I'm gonna kill you 'cause I want you dead.

445
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:20,330
I just want you completely dead.

446
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:24,501
Just no Iife in you at all. Just not breathing.
Just maggot food.

447
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:27,921
Here, son, try to taste that for me.

448
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:30,340
Hey, I'm not tasting that. Thank you.

449
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,509
What you doing here, son? What you want?

450
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,012
Well, I wanted to talk to you, Madea. I have...

451
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:36,597
You want some money or something?
I ain't got no money.

452
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:38,515
You don't need to be coming over here
asking me for no money.

453
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:40,475
Daddy, I didn't ask you for any money.

454
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:42,853
Good. Then Ioan me some,

455
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:46,023
'cause I need a Iittle change
for my Friday night Iights.

456
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:47,524
What are you talking about?

457
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:52,279
I be running them hoes, dawg.
I be running them hoes.

458
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:54,531
Shut up, fool.

459
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:57,784
I ain't got no money either, Brian.
What you want? What you come by here for?

460
00:26:57,869 --> 00:26:59,786
Well, I came by with a proposition.

461
00:26:59,871 --> 00:27:02,122
I just thought, you know,
you might wanna make a Iittle extra money.

462
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,707
You know, the Iast time a man told me

463
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,043
he had an opportunity for me
to make a Iittle money,

464
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:09,630
I ended up in Mexico,
chained to 20 other women,

465
00:27:09,714 --> 00:27:11,965
walking down the street, just selling myself.

466
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,634
You do need some money, don't you?

467
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:15,135
Yeah, I could always use
a Iittle bit of money.

468
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,553
Hell, things been tight around here.

469
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,139
I was even thinking about
going back to my old job.

470
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:21,558
- Stripping?
- No.

471
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:23,226
- Hooking?
- No.

472
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:25,062
- Robbing?
- No.

473
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:27,856
- Hit man?
- No.

474
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:30,609
Slinging?

475
00:27:31,277 --> 00:27:32,444
No.

476
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:34,821
I did have some hustle
back in my day, though.

477
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:38,283
I was doing a thing.
I was doing a thing back then.

478
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:39,993
I done got the better now.

479
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:43,246
Good those days are over here,
'cause you too big to be on a pole, Mabel.

480
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:46,291
I'm gonna tell you right now about that pole.
You know, they done switched them.

481
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,417
When you was back there dancing,

482
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:49,461
they had them telephone poles
you used to swing on.

483
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:51,797
Now, they got them Iittle brass poles.
I seen them.

484
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:53,382
You'd bend or broke one of them.
You'll bend it.

485
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:55,384
Your big ass'll break that brass.

486
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:58,011
Big ass and brass don't mix.

487
00:27:58,096 --> 00:28:02,057
Joe, shut up, please. Just die.
Stop breathing. Okay? Stop breathing.

488
00:28:02,141 --> 00:28:05,227
I'm talking about going back to work
at an old folks' home where I used to work.

489
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:07,396
No, no, you don't have to do that.
I got a great idea.

490
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,649
AII right, here's the situation.

491
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:13,110
I've got five people
that are in a Iittle bit of trouble.

492
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:15,028
One of them is a witness
on a case that I'm working on.

493
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:17,406
And I was wondering
if they could stay here for a while.

494
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,826
Just for a couple of months
until the trial is over, maybe?

495
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:22,786
Here? No.

496
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,663
You better shut that up now.
Ain't nobody coming up in here.

497
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:25,789
Hell to the no. Ain't nobody...

498
00:28:25,915 --> 00:28:28,250
You better hush that up now.
Ain't nobody coming up in here.

499
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:29,710
- Daddy.
- What?

500
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:31,128
No, that's just crazy.

501
00:28:31,254 --> 00:28:36,466
Have some criminal up in this house,
looking all crazy, and police looking...

502
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:41,012
Hell, that's how Mabel live every day,
ain't it? That's your Iife.

503
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:42,139
Shut up, rectum.

504
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,474
Go to hell.

505
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,076
Is somebody after them?

506
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,087
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:53,591
But, wait a minute.
I would not ask you to do this.

508
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:55,844
You're my aunt. I know they'll be safe here.

509
00:28:55,928 --> 00:28:59,180
Not one person would know they're here.
This is the safest place for them.

510
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:02,267
That's some bull.
He's trying to sell you a load of bull.

511
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:04,769
- What'd they do?
- I can't tell you that.

512
00:29:04,854 --> 00:29:07,147
But I can tell you this. I can tell you this.

513
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:12,360
You know, you, you pack. You know?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with you.

514
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:13,611
And this is the safest place for them.

515
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:17,365
You could be like their
witness protector, Madea.

516
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,451
Look here, don't be trying
to butter me up and all that stuff.

517
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:22,203
I see what you're trying to butter me up.

518
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,872
Yeah, I know I'm packing.

519
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:27,041
I know I can hold some things down,
but, no, I don't want nobody up in here.

520
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,376
I'm sorry. Absolutely not.

521
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:31,129
I cannot do that. You're gonna have to find
somewhere else for them to go.

522
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:34,132
The answer's a flat-out no,
and I am not changing my mind.

523
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:36,718
My no mean "no," my yes mean "yes."

524
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:38,970
And my "maybe" mean "get the hell out."
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:42,390
Absolutely not. Flat-out no.
Ain't gonna happen. Get on out of here. No.

526
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:44,142
Too bad, then.

527
00:29:44,226 --> 00:29:47,896
I'll just tell my boss we'll have to find
somewhere else for them to stay.

528
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:52,192
Guess some other lucky person
will make that $4,000 a month.

529
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:54,569
You know what?

530
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:57,822
I believe it would be the greatest
Christianity thing I could do

531
00:29:57,907 --> 00:29:59,073
to help somebody in need.

532
00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:02,076
So I'm gonna go ahead
and make up these sheets and clean up.

533
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:05,079
Mabel, you know, I believe I'm gonna go
drag that cot out of that garage.

534
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:07,415
I got a cot back there,
and we can put a sheet up in my room.

535
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:10,919
We could share, make sure we got
enough room for everybody up in here.

536
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:12,253
So is that a yes?

537
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,589
Ain't nothing wrong with that cot.
Ain't nothing wrong with it at all.

538
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:17,842
Got a Iittle mold growing in it, but that's
all right. As long as you don't breathe...

539
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:57,715
Where the hell are we?

540
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,384
Honey, we are in the South.

541
00:30:59,468 --> 00:31:00,551
Yes, ma'am.

542
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:04,305
And it brings back pretty fond memories.

543
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,473
Of what, Grams?

544
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:09,143
A boat and a man, and...

545
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:11,813
My, he had such a big...

546
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,650
Boat.

547
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,570
Hi. George?

548
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:22,657
Yes, I'm George,

549
00:31:22,783 --> 00:31:27,495
and this is my daughter, Cindy,
and my wife, Kate, and my son, Howie,

550
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:29,580
- and my mother, Barbara.
- Hi, how are you?

551
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,084
The man in the boat.

552
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:41,592
Don't have a clue.

553
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:45,972
Cute man.

554
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:50,184
Well, I'm Brian Simmons,

555
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:52,770
and I just want all of you to know
you're gonna be in safe hands, okay?

556
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:54,022
I'm a federal prosecutor,

557
00:31:54,106 --> 00:31:56,107
and we have a very safe place for you
and the entire family.

558
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:04,866
Well, here we go, kids.

559
00:32:05,075 --> 00:32:06,117
This way, ma'am.

560
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:07,535
Place looks haunted.

561
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:11,831
Is this neighborhood safe?

562
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,084
- It's very safe.
- Okay.

563
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,838
There's no safer place
for you and your family. Trust me.

564
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:24,010
This is not a hotel.

565
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:29,557
Okay, Madea's gonna Iove this one.

566
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:36,230
Madea?

567
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:38,733
How's my favorite aunt, Madea?

568
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,361
That Brian? Come on in.

569
00:32:41,737 --> 00:32:44,030
The family's here
that I was telling you about.

570
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:02,215
Hello.

571
00:33:07,304 --> 00:33:09,764
Brian, what the hell's going on?

572
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,309
Madea, this is the family
that I was telling you about.

573
00:33:16,814 --> 00:33:20,108
You forgot to mention one little
important thing about this family.

574
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:22,902
What's that?

575
00:33:25,948 --> 00:33:27,782
Don't play with me.

576
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:30,952
Madea, these are the Needlemans,

577
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,204
and they'll be staying with you
for a few months.

578
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:35,289
What? Months?

579
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,167
Are you joking? What, is he joking?

580
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:39,419
Cindy.

581
00:33:39,503 --> 00:33:41,796
Dad, I can't stay here.

582
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:43,881
What, are we sharecroppers now?

583
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:45,925
Honey, not nice.

584
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:48,010
Hi, I'm George.

585
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:49,929
And I'm his mother, Barbara.

586
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:52,807
And I'm his wife, Kate,
and these are our kids, Howie and Cindy.

587
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:55,560
I'm his child. I'm not her daughter.

588
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:56,978
Dad, I can't stay here.

589
00:33:57,354 --> 00:33:59,647
You know, I think it's kind of nice here.

590
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:01,315
- I like it.
- Yeah, you would, you moron.

591
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:03,651
- Would you...
- This is great. Just great.

592
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:06,654
- Honey.
- Yeah, "vacation" my ass.

593
00:34:07,156 --> 00:34:08,656
Hello, trip from hell.

594
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:16,622
Okay. Look here,

595
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:21,085
would y'all go on into the living room
and have a seat, please?

596
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:24,714
I would like to talk to my nephew
in private just a moment.

597
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,215
Thank you so much for...

598
00:34:26,341 --> 00:34:28,885
It's gonna be so lovely
having all of y'all here.

599
00:34:29,011 --> 00:34:31,762
Yes, just wonderful. Wonderful.

600
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:33,681
We'll be right in.

601
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:44,400
- What did you do that for?
- What the hell wrong with you?

602
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:48,029
You done brought these folks up
in this house. What is wrong with you?

603
00:34:48,864 --> 00:34:51,449
Madea, Iisten. Okay,
I know that they're not African-American.

604
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,326
I don't care nothing
about the color of their skin.

605
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,329
I wanna know how in the hell
I'm supposed to hide five white folks

606
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:59,248
in a neighborhood where we ain't even got
white cats or white cars.

607
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:01,792
Ain't nothing white around here.
If the police come in this neighborhood,

608
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:04,086
they don't even come in a white car.
They send a black SUV.

609
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:08,466
I understand, but listen, listen.
I know that you can figure it out.

610
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,550
I know you'll work it out.

611
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:14,430
Boy, hear me clearly and good
when I say this to you.

612
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:17,225
Son, I don't know how to hide these people.

613
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:21,562
You can do it. $4,000 a month. $4,000.

614
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:23,231
You ain't Iistening to me, son.

615
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:25,358
These people are gonna stick out
around here

616
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:28,110
like I would stick out
at a Republica Convention.

617
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:31,572
Do I look like I'm a Newt Ginger fan?
Do I look like I like Newt Gingery?

618
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:35,451
Madea, okay, okay. But you'll figure it out.
I know you'll figure it out.

619
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:39,747
Are we sitting on plastic?

620
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:42,083
Mabel, I can't find the phone book.

621
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:44,293
I'm trying to find somebody.
Where are the White Pages?

622
00:35:44,836 --> 00:35:46,504
My.

623
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,257
The man in the boat.

624
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:53,427
Hello.

625
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:59,100
Hey.

626
00:36:12,614 --> 00:36:14,949
Mabel, they white folks.

627
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:17,118
Really? I didn't notice.

628
00:36:17,995 --> 00:36:19,620
Come on. I'll introduce you.

629
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,460
Needleman family, this is my father, Joe.
You already met my Aunt Madea.

630
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,135
Dad, this is Howie, Kate, George, Cindy,
and Barbara.

631
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:38,347
It Iooks Iike she's undressing me
with her eyes.

632
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:43,769
Now, I'm sure that the agents told you,
but I just want to reiterate.

633
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:46,480
You can't have any contact with anyone
from your past as Iong as you're here.

634
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:47,607
Do you understand?

635
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:48,816
Dad?

636
00:36:49,151 --> 00:36:50,860
Honey, I'm sorry.

637
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:53,863
This is crazy.

638
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:56,490
You suck.

639
00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:59,619
Did she just say... I know she...

640
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:01,370
Did that child just say
she sucked to her daddy?

641
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:05,541
Lord, have mercy.
What generation is this? You can't...

642
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:08,919
You better hurry up
and get them the hell out of here.

643
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,547
Mabel gonna kill that little girl.

644
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:15,259
But, Cindy, this is only until the trial is over.
Isn't that right, Brian?

645
00:37:15,344 --> 00:37:17,887
Yes, just until the trial is over.

646
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:19,805
I hate you.

647
00:37:20,432 --> 00:37:23,225
That girl says she hate him. Oh, Lord,
somebody gonna have to help me.

648
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,436
God, help me. God, help me.

649
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:28,314
George, I know it's been
a rough day for you, so I tell you what.

650
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:30,650
I'll come by tomorrow morning about 9:00,
pick you up.

651
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:32,860
We'll go to the office
and begin working on this case, okay?

652
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:37,823
So, Madea, why don't you show your
house guests where they'll be staying?

653
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:41,035
Yeah, go on and show them, Mabel.
I ain't trying to go up there with them.

654
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,914
That one right there,
I don't Iike the way she's Iooking at me.

655
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:48,000
Well, you can show me to the door.
I'm getting back on that plane.

656
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:49,418
- Honey.
- Excuse us.

657
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:52,171
- You don't talk Iike that. Watch your mouth.
- Are you kidding me? Seriously.

658
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:53,464
Your ass trying to get me a case.

659
00:37:53,548 --> 00:37:55,383
That's what you trying to do.
You're trying to get me a case.

660
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:59,095
Better get a speedy trial.
I'm gonna tell you that right now.

661
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:02,056
I'll get a speedy trial.

662
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,229
What's happening to us?

663
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:11,982
Kate, if I'd known

664
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:15,486
that taking care of my family
would lead us to this, I would've...

665
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,364
This wasn't about family.
This was about you.

666
00:38:18,448 --> 00:38:20,825
We have way more than we needed.

667
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:24,370
This was about greed.

668
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:25,913
You know, sweetheart,

669
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:30,501
I seem to recall you were very happy
with my promotion, too.

670
00:38:30,585 --> 00:38:32,002
What were you thinking?

671
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:38,008
I don't know.
I wasn't even aware this was going on.

672
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:41,345
You're not aware
of a lot of things going on now.

673
00:38:43,432 --> 00:38:45,599
- Kate...
- I don't wanna talk about this.

674
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:48,144
I'm gonna unpack my bag and go to sleep.

675
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:50,813
We're done. It's done.

676
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:55,526
It's gonna end just like that?

677
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,069
Come on, man. Don't let her pimp you.

678
00:38:57,154 --> 00:38:59,321
She wanna go to sleep? Knock her ass out.

679
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:02,658
Joe, shut the hell up.
They're having a private conversation

680
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:05,244
in a room about not being aware
of what's going on.

681
00:39:05,328 --> 00:39:07,329
If he ain't aware,
that is between the two of them.

682
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:10,374
Shut up. Let them have
their private moment, please.

683
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:14,128
When a door is closed, that mean
you ain't supposed to be listening.

684
00:39:14,212 --> 00:39:16,630
Leave them people alone. Shut the hell up.

685
00:39:16,715 --> 00:39:18,591
- Mabel, you shut up.
- No, you shut the hell up.

686
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:20,718
Mabel, I'm older than you.
I'll do whatever the hell I want to do.

687
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,303
Yeah, it's my house.
You gonna shut up up in here

688
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:24,263
or I'm gonna come up and
cut your vocal cords out.

689
00:39:24,347 --> 00:39:25,848
You ain't gonna be able to say
a damn thing!

690
00:39:26,057 --> 00:39:27,057
Good night.

691
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,822
What the hell?

692
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:46,243
Boy! Boy!

693
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:52,416
Is that you farting, son?

694
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:55,044
It wasn't me.

695
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:57,463
Fart one more time.
That's all I'm gonna tell you.

696
00:39:57,547 --> 00:39:59,340
Fart one more time.

697
00:40:00,884 --> 00:40:02,885
In here farting like that.

698
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:06,764
What's wrong with you, boy?
That's doggone insane.

699
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:08,641
Hello, Joe.

700
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:11,352
You wanna give it a go?

701
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,939
Mabel.

702
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,236
Mabel, they trying to get me.

703
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:23,072
No, no, trying to get me

704
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:26,116
Iike they get them football players
and them basketball players.

705
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:30,496
I don't think so. No, no, no.

706
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,081
I won't bite.

707
00:40:52,018 --> 00:40:54,520
Lord, Lord, Lord.

708
00:40:57,732 --> 00:40:59,275
You staring at me?

709
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:04,864
No, no, I wasn't staring at you.

710
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:06,156
Okay.

711
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:10,160
I was watching the wildebeest
in its natural habitat, though.

712
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:11,912
Excuse me?

713
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:16,584
That's not nice.

714
00:41:16,668 --> 00:41:20,921
Yeah. Her butt must be hungry,
'cause it's chewing that dress alive.

715
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:27,303
If you need anything, anything at all,

716
00:41:29,014 --> 00:41:31,432
I'm just a whisper away.

717
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:33,309
All you got to do is whisper.

718
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:40,316
Okay, I think I'm done.

719
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:43,152
Where you rushing off to?

720
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:46,614
- Yoga's over.
- Okay.

721
00:41:46,698 --> 00:41:47,781
Creepy.

722
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:49,199
- Hi.
- How you doing?

723
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:51,535
- I'm good. Thank you.
- I see you was up in there doing that yoda.

724
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,954
It's yoga.

725
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,081
No, baby, I don't have no yogurt.
I don't eat that.

726
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,627
That mess my stomach up.
It's got that abiffidus bacalarus in it.

727
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:01,712
I can't have that. So you go on
and get yourself something else.

728
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:04,548
I might have some in that fridge there,
but I don't eat it.

729
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:05,841
Well, it looks like you've been cooking.

730
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:08,093
Yeah, I wanted to feed your family
their first day in my house.

731
00:42:08,178 --> 00:42:10,471
I wanted to make sure
y'all had something really good to eat.

732
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:15,309
So I got some waffles, some biscuits,
I got some pancakes, I got some bacon,

733
00:42:15,393 --> 00:42:17,311
I got ham. I put a Iot of butter on the ham,

734
00:42:17,395 --> 00:42:19,229
a lot of salt and pepper,
make it nice and flavorful.

735
00:42:19,314 --> 00:42:20,606
I got oatmeal on the stove.

736
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,982
I got sausage,

737
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:24,568
and I got eggs and grits and everything else.

738
00:42:24,653 --> 00:42:26,487
Y'all betterjust feast.

739
00:42:28,573 --> 00:42:30,157
It looks so good.

740
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:33,118
It's a lot of carbs. You like carbs?

741
00:42:33,203 --> 00:42:34,536
- It's a Iot of...
- Carbs.

742
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:36,747
No, baby, I don't eat crabs.
You can't eat no crabs.

743
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:39,583
You gonna have crabs and yogurt?
You about to mess your stomach up.

744
00:42:39,668 --> 00:42:41,919
Ain't no seafood on here, honey.
I'm allergic to seafood.

745
00:42:42,003 --> 00:42:43,337
Ain't no seafood here nowhere.

746
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:45,172
Is that how you stay so thin?

747
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:47,800
No, honey, I don't eat that stuff.
Where your family?

748
00:42:47,884 --> 00:42:49,969
They're sleeping still.

749
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:52,721
What? They got to get up.

750
00:42:53,264 --> 00:42:56,392
No, baby, your children got to go to school.
I got to get them registered,

751
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:58,978
and George is supposed to see Brian
down at the attorney's office.

752
00:42:59,062 --> 00:43:00,854
So, no, no, no, you got to get them up.

753
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:03,607
Okay, well, I was just gonna let...
You know, they're so exhausted.

754
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:05,943
- No, I'll go get them up. Here, you take this.
- Okay.

755
00:43:06,027 --> 00:43:07,236
Take this and stir that real good.

756
00:43:07,362 --> 00:43:09,405
- Whip it real, real good. You understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

757
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:11,532
All right, you need to put something... Here.

758
00:43:11,616 --> 00:43:13,367
Here, put this on.
Put this on while you whip.

759
00:43:13,451 --> 00:43:14,952
- You don't wanna get that on you.
- Okay. No.

760
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:16,245
- Put that on. Okay, whip it.
- Thank you.

761
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:18,414
- Whip it real good.
- I will.

762
00:43:23,628 --> 00:43:26,213
George, get up out this bed, son.

763
00:43:30,635 --> 00:43:31,802
Kate.

764
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:35,556
I had this horrible dream

765
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,351
that we were in trouble with the FBI,

766
00:43:39,436 --> 00:43:43,397
and we moved into this house
with an old woman who looked like...

767
00:43:44,983 --> 00:43:46,066
Like what?

768
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:48,277
You.

769
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,948
It's not a dream. It's really happening.

770
00:43:53,408 --> 00:43:55,117
I'm in so deep.

771
00:43:57,454 --> 00:44:00,581
George, you need to get up out this bed.
Brian is waiting for you down at the office.

772
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:02,374
He said he was gonna have you
come down there this morning.

773
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:04,209
Now, get up on out this bed.

774
00:44:04,294 --> 00:44:07,463
My Iife is over.
I'm not getting out of this bed.

775
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:09,798
There's no reason to get out of this bed.

776
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:13,302
You need a reason? You need a reason?

777
00:44:15,513 --> 00:44:18,015
You better get your ass out this bed.

778
00:44:22,645 --> 00:44:25,022
Is that enough reason for you?

779
00:44:25,106 --> 00:44:26,190
Let me tell you something, son.

780
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:29,276
I don't allow nobody to feel sorry
for themselves in my house.

781
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,153
I don't know what you did.
I don't care what you did.

782
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:32,279
Do you understand?

783
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:33,947
I need you to get up out this bed,
come downstairs,

784
00:44:34,032 --> 00:44:36,867
have breakfast with your family,
Brian is waiting on you down at the office

785
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:38,285
to talk about
whatever y'all need to talk about.

786
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:41,747
It ain't my business. I don't wanna know,
but you gonna get up out this bed.

787
00:44:41,831 --> 00:44:43,707
If I come back up these stairs,
and you still in this bed,

788
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,417
do you have any idea what I'm gonna do?

789
00:44:45,502 --> 00:44:48,796
I'm gonna get completely naked,
and get up in there with you and spoon.

790
00:44:50,006 --> 00:44:51,256
I'm up.

791
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:52,341
Thank you.

792
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:55,719
I am definitely up.
You don't have to come back.

793
00:44:55,804 --> 00:44:59,181
I'm coming right down.
I'm coming right down.

794
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:02,643
I'm on my way.

795
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,822
Get up, son.

796
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:18,700
What's wrong?

797
00:45:19,661 --> 00:45:21,453
You just scared me.

798
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:25,833
You're just so huge.
Like a giant bag of Skittles.

799
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:29,586
All right, you better get the hell up,

800
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:31,505
or when I come back up in here,
you know what's gonna happen?

801
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:34,007
You gonna taste the rainbow.

802
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,983
- Now, get up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

803
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,320
Probably dreaming about Skittles
and Coca-Cola and Pepsi,

804
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:41,781
diet soda and Mountain Dew
and Honey Buns,

805
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:43,741
and damn Krispy Kreme and everything else.

806
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,867
So you're up?

807
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:48,496
There you are, Sadie.
You must iron the sheets.

808
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:52,041
Mr. Needleman gets very angry
if there are any wrinkles.

809
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,504
Honey, who the hell is Sadie?

810
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,631
Don't you use that kind of language with me.

811
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:02,134
'Cause I'll have you fired.
Do you understand?

812
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:05,054
Mrs. Needleman. Okay, I get it.

813
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,183
The mall is open, but there
ain't nobody in there shopping.

814
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,103
What's that smell?

815
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:14,689
It's called food. I'm cooking.

816
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:17,817
It smells up the whole house. It permeates.

817
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:22,697
Thank you. You always were
the best colored help we could ever find.

818
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:27,827
Okay, Brian playing a joke on me.

819
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:31,288
I'm being Punk'd. I know I'm being Punk'd.
Where the camera at?

820
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:33,332
Little girl, I need you to get up, honey.

821
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,209
Go away.

822
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:44,760
Never had no child talk to me
like this before. Lordy.

823
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:48,764
Honey, I got to bring y'all down to school
and get you registered. Now, get up.

824
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,685
I said, go away.

825
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:58,399
She just yelled at me in my house.
I don't know what she...

826
00:46:58,525 --> 00:46:59,817
Little girl,
I'm gonna tell you one more time...

827
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,944
I said, go away!

828
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,537
I know she didn't just...

829
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,711
Who the hell you think
you talking to?

830
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:23,632
Oh, my God! What is wrong with you?

831
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,801
This is my house.

832
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:28,429
You live by my rules
when you are in my house.

833
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,723
You're too young for that, little girl.
You don't want none of this.

834
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:34,810
Please, do yourself a favor, honey.
You do not want none of this.

835
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,980
Behave while you're here. If not, you will...

836
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:43,569
Girl, you...

837
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:46,238
Girl, you just don't know...

838
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,952
I don't know who she thinks
she's talking to.

839
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,746
She's insane.

840
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,251
Hello?

841
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,170
Is that you, son?

842
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:06,133
- Yes, sir.
- Well, come on in here.

843
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,262
What are you doing here, Dad?

844
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:13,140
Well, I'm feeling better, much better.

845
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:17,311
No, you're not.
You're supposed to be at home in bed.

846
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:21,482
I just had to stop by here
to make sure everything's all right.

847
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:22,983
It's all fine.

848
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:29,240
I've decided to tell the church
the third Sunday I'm retiring.

849
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,700
I thought you were gonna wait
till summer to do that.

850
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:35,246
No, I can't do that, son. I'm too tired.

851
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,748
It'll sure make the burden so much easier

852
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:42,795
to know that everything I've worked for
all these years is gonna be Iooked after.

853
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:46,173
I am very proud of you, son.
Really proud of you.

854
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:49,426
Don't be proud of me.

855
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:52,054
Are you kidding me?
I have to tell you I'm proud of you.

856
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,307
You know something?
After your mother died,

857
00:48:55,392 --> 00:48:56,684
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

858
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,813
You were so far out there in those streets.

859
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,731
But, praise the Lord, Iook at you now.

860
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:07,486
Helping me run the church,
handling our mortgage payment fund.

861
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:09,196
No, I am very proud of you, son.

862
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,991
You know, the congregation
is gonna be a Iittle bit upset

863
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:16,036
when I tell them that I'm retiring,
so to ease the pain,

864
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:20,249
I'm going to tell them that we have raised
the money to pay off the church.

865
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,502
They're gonna rejoice.

866
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,338
Well done, son.

867
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:27,756
Yes, sir.

868
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:40,477
I don't see her out here. Y'all come on.
Come on. Hurry up.

869
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:43,939
She always nosy as hell,
over there Iooking at everything.

870
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:45,399
Hurry up.

871
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:53,032
- Come on. Get in the car.
- Madea.

872
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,283
Madea.

873
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,618
Hey, Hattie.

874
00:49:56,578 --> 00:49:57,745
How you doing?

875
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,121
- I'm good, baby.
- Open the door.

876
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,832
- Come here a minute.
- I can't talk to you right now, honey.

877
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:04,835
This my cousins, and they done Iost
all the pigmentation in their skin overnight.

878
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,211
- Your cousins?
- Yes.

879
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:07,296
Can I help you?

880
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,798
No, I got to take them
to the doctor right now.

881
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:12,092
I'll see you Iater on. Take care.

882
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,599
And that's all you know?

883
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,976
That's all I know. I swear it.

884
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,603
I don't believe you.

885
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,773
I'm telling you the truth.

886
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:29,193
You're going to jail for a very Iong time.

887
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:39,203
I can't go to jail. I didn't do anything wrong.

888
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:41,664
George, calm down, okay?

889
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:45,417
For what it's worth, I believe you.

890
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:50,464
Oh, boy, somebody believes me.
Isn't that wonderful?

891
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:55,094
Let's crack open some champagne,
because somebody believes me.

892
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:57,972
Oh, God, I'm in trouble.

893
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:05,980
I think they can believe you, too,
but you have to help me make them believe.

894
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:10,901
Just tell me what you want me to do.

895
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:13,779
What do I need to do here?

896
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:16,615
Okay, that's a good attitude, George.
Really good attitude.

897
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,576
Everything that wasn't shredded
or destroyed is in these files.

898
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:23,747
This is your ticket to freedom.
You're the CFO. I'm sure you can find it.

899
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,708
Okay, well,

900
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:30,546
this is the crux of the problem here, Brian,

901
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:35,759
because I can't seem to find anything
in here that will help.

902
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,720
I wanna help you. I really do.

903
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:42,057
It doesn't make any sense
for me not to wanna help.

904
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:44,852
Now does it? Does it? No. No.

905
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:48,397
I mean, don't you think
I would help if I could?

906
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:54,028
- Are you okay?
- No, I just...

907
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,989
I feel Iike I... I wanna hit something.

908
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,907
Hit the chair. Hit something.

909
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:10,544
I'm sorry.

910
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,479
That was a Iovely evening.

911
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:32,900
There ain't never been no evening, Iady.
I don't know you.

912
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:37,321
Stop it. There's no one around.

913
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:40,407
Read my Iips, honey. I don't know you.

914
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,911
You're the man in the boat.

915
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:46,080
I ain't never had no boat.

916
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:53,670
I bet if I showed you my tattoo,
you might remember.

917
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:56,548
What tattoo? What you fixing to show me?

918
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:04,098
I believe you need to see a doctor
about that, honey.

919
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:07,434
No, that's Betty Boop.

920
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:13,524
It might have been Betty Boop at one time,
but Betty Boop done drooped.

921
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,192
Betty Boop.

922
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,945
You brought me over in your Iittle boat.

923
00:53:18,071 --> 00:53:23,283
Lady, for the Iast time, okay?
First of all, you insulted me.

924
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:24,701
'Cause I wouldn't have a Iittle boat.

925
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,204
I'm not a canoe kind of man.
You understand?

926
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:31,041
I'm a yacht, a cruise ship,
Noah's Ark up in this piece.

927
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:34,294
Only time I was ever in a boat was
that Iittle rowboat belonged to the Army

928
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,296
when I was in New Orleans many years ago.

929
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:39,550
I'd take people across the water
over there from the bayou to the juke joint,

930
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:41,051
and I'd charge them a nickel
to get them over there.

931
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:43,554
And they'd all take the ride and everything.
I'd give them their change.

932
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:46,974
And somebody gave me a 50-cent tip
that night.

933
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:54,064
You Barbara Betty Boop.

934
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:57,985
Yes, I was a nurse in Company B.

935
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:03,157
Yeah, I was in Company C
over there with the colored troops.

936
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:06,994
Me and a couple of my girlfriends followed
you guys all the way to your barracks.

937
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,496
Yeah, I remember it was four of you.

938
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:15,919
It was Blanche, Rose, Dorothy, and you.

939
00:54:19,174 --> 00:54:20,757
I don't even know
how you remember that, honey.

940
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:23,760
That was 56, 57 years ago.

941
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:25,929
Fifty-three.

942
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:28,140
Because George is 52.

943
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,436
What that got to do with anything?

944
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:37,107
What day is it?

945
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:41,153
Lady, don't you start...
What you trying to tell me?

946
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:44,531
Where am I?

947
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:47,284
I think you believe you're trying
to tell me something about George.

948
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,119
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hey.

949
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:50,954
I don't know where I am.

950
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:58,670
George?

951
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,634
- Brian.
- Jake.

952
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:05,552
You cannot keep calling me Iike this, man.

953
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,512
I'm in the middle of an investigation.
What are you doing?

954
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:11,391
My dad wants to announce that he's paying
the church's mortgage off in three weeks.

955
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,060
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

956
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:14,895
Tell him the truth.

957
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,063
That will kill him.

958
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:18,482
He'll be very happy
that you told him the truth.

959
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,150
I can't. I can't do it.

960
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:21,485
Jake.

961
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:23,570
That's him. That's the dude from the news!

962
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:25,489
I ought to kill you!

963
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:27,908
- Who is this?
- I'm your worst nightmare.

964
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,326
Will you just...

965
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:33,413
You're my worst... I got news for you.
I'm Iiving my worst nightmare, okay?

966
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,583
And besides, you're a Iittle short
to be a nightmare, aren't you?

967
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:39,253
I'm short? He called me...
He called me short?

968
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:40,921
I'm gonna bust your balls!

969
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:44,424
Well, why don't you get in Iine
and bust my balls?

970
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,010
Because everybody else is busting my balls.

971
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:50,222
I don't have any balls Ieft, mister!
How about that?

972
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,599
I'm gonna... Get off.

973
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,352
Calm down. Nobody's kicking balls.

974
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,729
George, Jake, I need you both to calm down.

975
00:55:57,814 --> 00:55:59,273
Is everything all right out there?

976
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,607
Everything's fine.

977
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,528
Just keep working. It's all good.

978
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:07,281
George, this is Jake.

979
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:11,368
His father has a church,
and they were gonna pay off their mortgage,

980
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:15,289
and they invested the money in Lockwise,
and they Iost it all.

981
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,374
So he's a Iittle bit upset.

982
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:20,043
- I'm sorry.
- You...

983
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:23,171
That's all you got to say? Is you sorry?

984
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:24,673
- Jake.
- Hell...

985
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:27,009
Yeah. Okay, okay.
You better watch yourself,

986
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,343
or I'm gonna give you a...

987
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:32,055
You see this? Big five. Big five.
And you're gonna get it.

988
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,474
If I didn't have to go to the bathroom,
you'd be in...

989
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,393
- Where's the bathroom, Brian?
- Okay.

990
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:37,602
Third door on the Ieft.

991
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:39,604
- Third door on the Ieft.
- Yeah.

992
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:41,898
Big five?

993
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:46,153
Jake, go home.

994
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:50,198
Get a grip, okay? Tell him the truth.

995
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,701
If anything comes up, I'll call you.

996
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:55,746
Can't you just go home?
Elevator's right there.

997
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,424
How tall are you, son?

998
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:11,511
About 6 feet.

999
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,638
- About 6 feet?
- Yeah.

1000
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,267
Okay. Check.

1001
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:21,605
You Iike soul music?

1002
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:27,611
I do. I do. I Iove soul music.

1003
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,197
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

1004
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:32,866
Find out what it mean to me.

1005
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,785
No, I dig it.

1006
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,287
You dig it. You dig it?

1007
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:40,540
Check.

1008
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,049
Your hair's really thick and curly.

1009
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:51,635
Always been that thick and curly?

1010
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:53,387
Yeah, it has.

1011
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:56,306
When I was a kid, I had an afro that was,

1012
00:57:57,016 --> 00:58:00,060
you know, Iarge.

1013
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,230
To here. Big, big hair.

1014
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:06,942
No, you said it right. You had an afro.
You didn't offend me. You had an afro.

1015
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:08,819
That's what you called it, an afro. Check.

1016
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,320
An afro.

1017
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,325
Can you swim, son?

1018
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:19,162
No. No.

1019
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:22,249
I never got the hang of swimming.

1020
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:26,920
Never got the hang of it. Yup. Check.

1021
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:31,425
Hey, I was Iooking at your wife,
she was doing that yoda.

1022
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:34,219
And she got a nice Iittle butt.

1023
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,763
But it ain't no booty, you know?

1024
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:41,059
You Iike a butt, or you Iike a booty?

1025
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:46,940
You Iike a booty, one that's a big, old booty
to grab Iike handlebars and use?

1026
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:50,277
Steer that thing where you want it to go,
you know?

1027
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:53,113
To be honest,

1028
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,448
I Iove my wife.

1029
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,950
She can't hear you. She can't hear.
Man-to-man, go on and tell me.

1030
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,203
Do you Iike a Iittle cute, nice Iittle butt,
or do you Iike a big butt

1031
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,914
that you can grab that thing
and slap it Iike handlebars?

1032
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:08,795
Well, I would Iike
a Iittle more on the bottom.

1033
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,297
Harley-Davidson.

1034
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:11,465
- A Harley?
- Yeah.

1035
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:12,966
Junk in the trunk.

1036
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,553
Some junk in the trunk. Yeah, more junk.

1037
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:20,056
As Iong as you're asking.

1038
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:25,562
I got one Iast question for you, son.

1039
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:30,484
When you go to the bathroom
and you're at the urinal,

1040
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,487
do you stand there Iike this?

1041
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:38,074
Or do you just happen
to stand there Iike this?

1042
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:40,994
Well...

1043
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,580
And when you're finished,
do you have to do this?

1044
00:59:46,918 --> 00:59:49,085
Which one is it for you, son? Which one?

1045
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,172
Well, more Iike the second part.

1046
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:55,342
Without the thing at the end.

1047
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:58,011
Check.

1048
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:01,765
Damn. I'm your daddy.

1049
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,435
Excuse me?

1050
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:07,854
Do you have any Wi-Fi?

1051
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,525
Well, if you ask me nice,
I'll get up and I'll make you some.

1052
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,695
Excuse me. How do you make Wi-Fi?

1053
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:20,200
Son, you use some flour,
put a Iittle water in it, some powdered sugar,

1054
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:21,952
you mix it up real good,
and you get your skillet,

1055
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:23,453
or you get you one of them Wi-Fi irons,

1056
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:26,706
and you pour it in the Wi-Fi iron
and you close it up.

1057
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:29,042
I got a Wi-Fi iron in there.

1058
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,794
What are you talking about?

1059
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:35,215
He asked for a Wi-Fi, I got a waffle.
You want a Wi-Fi? I got a waffle.

1060
01:00:35,341 --> 01:00:37,509
Wi-Fi. Internet.

1061
01:00:39,387 --> 01:00:41,221
I don't have none of that.

1062
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:44,307
Ain't no technology around here at all.
We've been Ieft in the Dark Ages.

1063
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,810
It figures.

1064
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:47,978
Howie.

1065
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:49,563
Honey, why do you need
to get on the Internet?

1066
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:51,147
I'm supposed to do a report.

1067
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:53,567
I'll help you with your report. Okay, honey?

1068
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,902
It doesn't really matter.
I mean, he's gonna fail.

1069
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:58,655
- He's dumb Iike his mother.
- Enough.

1070
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:00,323
Go to hell, Kate.

1071
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,537
Did that child just say, "Go to hell"?

1072
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,503
You all right?

1073
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:15,505
Yeah. Thanks.

1074
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,924
Come on, sit down and talk to me.

1075
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,304
That child right there. Lord, that Iittle girl
about to make me hurt her.

1076
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:25,348
I know. I'm trying to be understanding.

1077
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:26,725
Of what?

1078
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:29,394
She has problems.

1079
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:30,562
Honey, we all got problems.

1080
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:33,315
That child ain't supposed to be
talking to you all Iike that. That is crazy.

1081
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:36,151
What's wrong with that child?
What's she so angry about?

1082
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,903
I don't know.
Just being here and out of school.

1083
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:40,697
Tell that to somebody else, honey.

1084
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:45,035
That child is angry about something else,
and it's deep, whatever it is.

1085
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,706
It ain't about no school and nothing else.
This water runs deeper than that.

1086
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,082
How do you know?

1087
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,960
Wisdom. I didn't get this old
by not knowing nothing.

1088
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:59,758
She thinks I'm the reason
that her father divorced her mother.

1089
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,386
I wonder where she'd get that from.

1090
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:04,638
Are you?

1091
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,390
No. What kind of person do you think I am?

1092
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,643
A woman.

1093
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:13,021
No, their marriage was over,

1094
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:17,734
her father filed for divorce already,
but she's hated me ever since she met me.

1095
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,236
And George just sit there,
don't say nothing?

1096
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:21,863
He just sit there and not say a word?

1097
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:24,783
George doesn't say anything
to anyone these days.

1098
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:26,743
Lord, have mercy.

1099
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:28,578
I know. But she needs him.

1100
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:30,872
Because her mother, she is so evil.

1101
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,376
She filled her head with all these
horrible things about me and about us.

1102
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,835
And then, two years ago,

1103
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,381
she dropped her off at our doorstep,
hasn't contacted her ever since,

1104
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:40,965
and now she's angry.

1105
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:43,426
And now she's up in my house
and she got me worried.

1106
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:44,511
Honey, I'm just worried.

1107
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,221
She'll be fine.

1108
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:48,181
I'm not worried about her,
I'm worried about me.

1109
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,058
'Cause I feel Iike I wanna choke her to sleep.

1110
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:52,352
I just wanna grab her
till the Iife is out of her sometimes.

1111
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:53,561
She's so flip.

1112
01:02:53,646 --> 01:02:54,979
Yeah, I get it.

1113
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:57,941
And when she talk back to you,
you just have a Iittle argument with her

1114
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:00,694
and you just Iet her start her mouth
and say whatever she want to say?

1115
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:01,861
Don't do that, honey.

1116
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:05,407
You have to talk to her in a Ianguage
that she understand.

1117
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:08,201
You got to Iearn
how to start speaking your damn mind.

1118
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,369
I speak my mind.

1119
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:12,622
I didn't say, "Speak your mind,"
I said, "Speak your damn mind."

1120
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:14,833
If somebody do something
you don't Iike, you say,

1121
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,543
"Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

1122
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:18,920
"You better get your ass together.
This is some straight up bull.

1123
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:22,006
"Hell, what is wrong with you?
You heard me? Hell."

1124
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:24,843
That's what you got
to say to them sometime.

1125
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:27,178
- Okay. I will.
- Think about that.

1126
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:29,013
It'll make you feel better.
You'll feel so Iiberated.

1127
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:32,058
You're around here doing all that yoda.
Honey, you ain't got to do all that yoda.

1128
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:33,685
You ain't got to do not one more yoda.

1129
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:35,562
I'm gonna try that next time.

1130
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,188
Good. I just gave you some great advice.

1131
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:38,606
You gave me some good advice.

1132
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:39,899
I'm gonna give you some better advice.

1133
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:41,025
White folks ain't supposed to be out here

1134
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:42,694
on this porch
in the middle of the night, honey.

1135
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:43,778
Okay.

1136
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,905
Yep. Nope, come on,
Iet's go on in the house.

1137
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,782
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you go on first.

1138
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:51,953
Any luck?

1139
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:54,247
No, none.

1140
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,708
George.

1141
01:03:56,792 --> 01:04:01,004
Yeah, I know what you're going to say.
You don't think I'm trying.

1142
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,965
Look at this charity, right here.

1143
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:07,427
Okay. I don't really have to Iook at it.

1144
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:10,221
Hear me out.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

1145
01:04:10,306 --> 01:04:12,348
These guys dig wells in Africa.

1146
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,976
This one, breast cancer.

1147
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,522
This one,
they stop sex trafficking of children. Okay?

1148
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:22,025
This one, AIDS research. This one, cancer.

1149
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:24,152
This homeless shelter
is gonna have to close.

1150
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:27,197
George, you got to help me
help these people.

1151
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:39,292
Brian, I'm eight years away from retiring,

1152
01:04:40,503 --> 01:04:42,712
and now I'm facing jail.

1153
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:45,507
And all these people were hurt

1154
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,927
because I wasn't paying attention.

1155
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:53,598
And I was Iooking forward to retiring.

1156
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:57,644
Spending time with my son.

1157
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:03,107
Getting great, big bear hugs
after a good game of catch, you know?

1158
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,902
Seeing my daughter happy,

1159
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,571
content.

1160
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:14,202
I just wanted to Iive happily ever after
with my family.

1161
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,666
And now, my family's falling apart.

1162
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:24,128
So maybe I deserve all of this, okay?

1163
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:27,549
'Cause I can't believe
what's happening to me.

1164
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:30,343
How could I not see this coming?

1165
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:35,098
George, you couldn't see it
because you weren't paying attention.

1166
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:37,058
But now your eyes are wide open.

1167
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:41,855
But none of this makes sense to me.

1168
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:45,859
I mean, I see accounts here and they all start
with a Ietter of the alphabet.

1169
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:50,989
"A," "P," "U," "J," "K," "R," "I."

1170
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,701
We never use the alphabet
to start accounts, Brian.

1171
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:58,204
I don't know what I'm Iooking at here.
I really don't.

1172
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:04,210
You can't just keep Ietting people
walk all over you.

1173
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:08,840
You were a mark. They set you up.
They thought you were weak.

1174
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,302
They did this on purpose to you.

1175
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:13,928
Are you just gonna Iay down
and Iet that happen,

1176
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:15,513
or are you gonna claim your Iife back?

1177
01:06:15,598 --> 01:06:18,474
Prove them wrong.
Hit them right between the eyes.

1178
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:23,813
You're stronger than this.
There is a fighter in you, George.

1179
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:27,567
Show them. Show me.

1180
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:31,571
You can work this out, okay?
Just don't give up.

1181
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,867
Shall we keep digging?

1182
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:37,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

1183
01:06:37,745 --> 01:06:39,454
- Okay.
- AII right.

1184
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:41,205
Watch your step.

1185
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,919
Take care now.

1186
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:52,634
How was school?

1187
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:54,552
I mean, you know, it's school.

1188
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:56,054
School is school, yeah.

1189
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:57,597
What you got there?

1190
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,557
- Baseball.
- Baseball.

1191
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:00,683
You play?

1192
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:03,603
Yeah, but not very good.

1193
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,063
Really?

1194
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:07,190
Well, Iet me see, son. You can't be that bad.

1195
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:08,775
- What position do you play?
- Pitcher.

1196
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:10,193
Okay. Well, I used to play catcher.

1197
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,153
So, you go on over there
and I want you to throw it to me.

1198
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,363
- AII right.
- I want you to throw it to me

1199
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:14,530
as hard as you can.

1200
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:17,241
- Throw it at me.
- AII right.

1201
01:07:17,326 --> 01:07:18,868
Here we go. Put it. Put it right here.

1202
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:21,496
- Put it right in the middle.
- Right here, right here.

1203
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,168
Yeah, you... Yeah.

1204
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,295
- Yeah, you suck.
- Sorry, I...

1205
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:32,215
Come here, son.

1206
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:34,926
That's all right, son.

1207
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,262
Maybe you ain't supposed to be a pitcher.
Everybody ain't supposed to be a pitcher.

1208
01:07:38,347 --> 01:07:40,390
You know, you got to get in where you fit in.

1209
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,100
You know, I never thought about it that way.

1210
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:43,476
But Iisten, son. I'm gonna help you.

1211
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,562
I'm gonna teach you how to pitch
and to catch,

1212
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:48,648
because we family, we family.

1213
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,608
- We are?
- Yeah.

1214
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:54,237
Yeah. It's a Iong story. It's a Iong story.

1215
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:55,863
I used to be in the Negro League.

1216
01:07:57,116 --> 01:07:59,158
- Negro...
- The Negro League, son.

1217
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:02,620
Boy, somebody got to teach you
about your heritage.

1218
01:08:02,705 --> 01:08:09,335
The Negro Leagues is when
colored baseball players couldn't play...

1219
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,171
Colored, Iike Negro, Iike me and you.

1220
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:16,801
They couldn't play professional baseball,
so they came up with their own Ieague.

1221
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:18,428
Satchel Paige and I played.

1222
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:22,348
I was a catcher,
so I'm gonna show you how to be a catcher.

1223
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:23,766
- AII right. AII right.
- AII right?

1224
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,893
Step on back there.
I'm gonna show you how to catch this.

1225
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,603
- I'm gonna throw it to you one good time.
- AII right.

1226
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:30,189
- I want you to concentrate real hard.
- AII right.

1227
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,861
Almost. AII right, try it.
Right here, right here.

1228
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:36,404
There we go. See that?

1229
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:38,614
- I've had it.
- I don't care.

1230
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:39,699
Change your attitude.

1231
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:41,200
- Hello, son.
- Hi, Mom.

1232
01:08:41,285 --> 01:08:43,202
- Your poor father...
- My father does not need...

1233
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:46,539
Were you with your brother today?
AII day today, again?

1234
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:50,585
No, Mom, I was with Brian.

1235
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,879
I don't have a brother, remember?

1236
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:54,964
This is all an act!

1237
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:56,049
Right.

1238
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,175
I am not being disrespectful!

1239
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,802
You're being so fake!
You're not my mom!

1240
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,220
- ...your attitude.
- You're making it no better.

1241
01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:02,305
Get upstairs!

1242
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:05,099
I want to go home. I hate it here.

1243
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:06,809
- Hi.
- Hi.

1244
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:09,395
George, I can't do this anymore.

1245
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,397
- That daughter is so disrespectful.
- I know.

1246
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:15,318
I'm gonna do all I can
to help us get our Iife back.

1247
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:17,570
I don't want our Iife back.

1248
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:19,906
I want a new Iife.

1249
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:23,076
One where you're in it.
One where we're all happy.

1250
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,954
I don't know, afternoon Iunches and sex!

1251
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:28,790
I want sex, George!

1252
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:30,958
Should I be Iistening to this?

1253
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:32,293
- No!
- No!

1254
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,631
Kate, I'm sorry.

1255
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:40,301
Stop saying sorry and get mad.

1256
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:42,470
- I am mad.
- You're not mad.

1257
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:44,722
I'm extremely mad.

1258
01:09:44,807 --> 01:09:46,432
Extremely mad, George?

1259
01:09:48,602 --> 01:09:49,894
You don't think I'm mad?

1260
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:51,437
I don't think you're mad.

1261
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:57,527
This is getting me so mad, this whole thing.

1262
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:58,736
That's mad.

1263
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:01,447
You're not extremely mad!
You need to get damn mad!

1264
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,116
What?

1265
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:06,452
I'm just speaking my damn mind, okay?

1266
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:09,455
Hell! This is some straight up bull.

1267
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:13,918
Hell, get your ass together. You heard me?

1268
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,294
Hell!

1269
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:22,844
I've got to get us out of here.

1270
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:27,473
Just spill it. We gotta have it all.

1271
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:30,726
Because if you don't, then you're
going to jail for the rest of your Iife.

1272
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,690
Ever since we got here,
I don't care anymore.

1273
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:37,900
Do you know what? I don't care.
You...

1274
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,501
- Hi, honey.
- Hi. What are you doing?

1275
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:11,934
- Good one. Good one, Howie.
- Thanks.

1276
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:14,353
You got it.

1277
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,584
Amazing Grace...

1278
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:40,213
How was school today?

1279
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:43,174
About the same
as when you were raised by Moses.

1280
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:44,842
Where's my dad?

1281
01:11:44,927 --> 01:11:46,761
I can't stand you.

1282
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:52,391
I got something to tell you, honey.
It's awfully bad news.

1283
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:54,435
Precious Lord...

1284
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:55,770
What?

1285
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:00,441
Your daddy died.

1286
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:03,527
What?

1287
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:04,737
He died.

1288
01:12:06,073 --> 01:12:10,076
Them people that were Iooking for him,
they came here and they got him.

1289
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:13,246
And they brought him out there
to the highway,

1290
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:18,000
and they was painting them stripes
on the stone highway, and he tried to run,

1291
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:21,379
and one of them stripe machine
put a Iine right down the middle of him.

1292
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:24,757
Then the people that was coming
didn't know if it was a passing Iane

1293
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:27,426
or high-occupancy vehicle Iane.

1294
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,136
Everybody got confused
and they had a wreck,

1295
01:12:29,263 --> 01:12:30,429
and they just ran all over...

1296
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:33,599
About 5,700 cars piled up on top of him.

1297
01:12:34,268 --> 01:12:38,020
And Kate, she didn't know what to do,
so she went to running.

1298
01:12:38,105 --> 01:12:41,774
She just started running as fast as she can.
Was running Iike Wonder Woman.

1299
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,403
But they had a helichopter
and that helichopter got closer...

1300
01:12:45,487 --> 01:12:46,737
And that was it.

1301
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:48,572
No! Kate, too?

1302
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:50,908
Kate, too. Kate, too.

1303
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:53,035
And that helichopter was spinning
and them blades...

1304
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,080
Where's Howie? Where's Howie?

1305
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,709
Oh, Lord. Poor Howie.
You know, he tried to run,

1306
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:02,962
but he always have them candy bars
and soda pops in his pockets,

1307
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:06,007
so he kept dropping things and he tripped.

1308
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,342
So they put them cement shoes on him
and they throwed him in,

1309
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:09,635
and he's swimming with the fishes.

1310
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:10,803
Oh, my God!

1311
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,432
My God! I can't believe this is happening.

1312
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:16,475
Why you so upset?

1313
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:17,935
What do you mean?

1314
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:21,605
Well, you always say, "I hate you. You suck.
Shut up. I hate you."

1315
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:25,026
I didn't mean anything that I've said before.

1316
01:13:25,152 --> 01:13:26,402
It's too Iate now, honey.

1317
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:29,822
It's all right. They gone. Dead. Just done.

1318
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:31,782
They gone.

1319
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:35,536
So, the people at Child Welfare asked me
if I would take you,

1320
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,413
so I said you can stay here till you're 18,
but you...

1321
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:39,707
No! No, no! No!

1322
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,168
I got an EBT card, what you worried about?

1323
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:43,336
- Dad!
- Honey.

1324
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,005
Cindy, what's wrong?

1325
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:48,007
She told me you died.

1326
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:49,216
What?

1327
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:52,386
Madea, why would you tell her that?

1328
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:53,804
Look, this is why I tell her that.

1329
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:56,682
'Cause she's sitting around here mad
at everybody and being all nasty and mean.

1330
01:13:56,808 --> 01:14:00,186
Your parents could be gone at any minute,
then you'll be stuck with somebody Iike me.

1331
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:02,605
Is that what you want?
To stay here in this hellhole?

1332
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:03,731
I'm sorry.

1333
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:06,150
Start acting Iike you're sorry, then.

1334
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:08,152
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Howie.

1335
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:09,737
It's all right. It's all right, Cindy.

1336
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:12,865
Now, Iook at her, all broke up,
acting Iike she's sad and hurt.

1337
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,827
Okay, honey. It's okay.

1338
01:14:16,912 --> 01:14:19,747
Madea, that was really cruel.

1339
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:23,000
George? Shut the hell up.

1340
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:25,378
It worked, didn't it?

1341
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:29,965
- Dad?
- Yeah, son.

1342
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,133
There's something I need to tell you.

1343
01:14:31,218 --> 01:14:34,762
It'll have to wait till Iater.
I got to start the service right now.

1344
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,352
Negros.

1345
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:47,483
What the hell did you just say?

1346
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:49,860
- Negros.
- Barbara!

1347
01:14:49,945 --> 01:14:51,153
Mom,

1348
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:56,575
why don't we step out onto the porch
and get some air?

1349
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,619
- Negros.
- Grams.

1350
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:01,622
I hear Negros from my room.

1351
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:05,084
I believe they're called
African-Americans now, Grandma.

1352
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,169
Did that child just say "they"?

1353
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:08,963
No, "we."

1354
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:12,675
So beautiful. I hear them from my room.

1355
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:13,968
- Okay.
- What's going on?

1356
01:15:14,052 --> 01:15:17,596
My baby mama just went Ieft, Mabel.
She just went Ieft.

1357
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:18,806
Went Ieft?

1358
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,349
I hear...

1359
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:25,354
I hear them from my room.
I hear Negros from my room.

1360
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:28,774
Well, I see dead people,
but I keep that to myself.

1361
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:30,484
Tell them, Sadie.

1362
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:31,944
Who the hell is Sadie?

1363
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:33,863
Shut up.

1364
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:37,241
Madea, honey. She right, she hear Negros.

1365
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:42,621
It's bad enough that she's slipping.

1366
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,290
Please don't encourage her.

1367
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:47,126
No, she do hear Negros.

1368
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,669
The whole bunch of them.

1369
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:52,298
She hears a bunch of Negros?

1370
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,093
Yes, everybody Iisten. Everybody be quiet.

1371
01:15:58,513 --> 01:15:59,930
Spirituals.

1372
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:02,725
That's it. That's what she's trying to say,
Negro spirituals.

1373
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:05,019
There's a church down on the corner.

1374
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:07,521
They sing Negro spirituals on Sundays.

1375
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:09,523
Why y'all so uptight?

1376
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:14,487
Son, will you take me to the Negros?

1377
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:16,906
- Take you to the Negro spiritual, honey.
- Spiritual.

1378
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:19,450
Right. You can't just say "Negros."
Them days has passed.

1379
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:21,452
First we were "Negros,"
then we was "colored,"

1380
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:24,038
then we were "black,"
now we "African-American."

1381
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:27,249
Okay? African-Americans.
Now singing old Negro spirituals.

1382
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:28,501
- Spirituals.
- Negro spirituals.

1383
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:31,921
- Spirituals. Spirituals. Okay.
- Yes, Mom. Yes, yes.

1384
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:33,339
Yes, Iet's go.

1385
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:37,134
Let's go down to the church.

1386
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:38,260
Is it safe?

1387
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:39,845
What you mean, "Is it safe," George?

1388
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:42,598
What they gonna do,
stone you with a Bible? It's a church.

1389
01:17:28,395 --> 01:17:29,770
Pretty good.

1390
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:43,367
Can I get an "amen" for our choir?

1391
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:44,785
Amen!

1392
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,328
AII right, well done.

1393
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:48,289
Well done.

1394
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:50,583
Praise the Lord.

1395
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:52,501
Praise the Lord!

1396
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:59,508
Praise the Lord. I am so happy, so happy
to be back in the House of the Lord

1397
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:03,262
where mercy can be found.

1398
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:08,726
As most of you know, I have
been very sick these past few months.

1399
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:12,313
But by the grace of God, I've recovered.
But I have to tell you something.

1400
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:18,110
I've given a Iot of prayer
and I feel it's time for me to retire.

1401
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:21,697
Now don't y'all worry, don't worry.

1402
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:25,034
This church will continue,
and its future's guaranteed,

1403
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:27,953
because the church has been paid off.

1404
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:35,169
Praise God!

1405
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:36,545
Oh, no.

1406
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:45,387
And I was able to pay the church off
because of the investments of my son.

1407
01:18:46,306 --> 01:18:47,514
My son.

1408
01:18:48,475 --> 01:18:49,892
I'm so proud of him.

1409
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:52,853
Son, come on up here
and tell them what you've done.

1410
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:56,482
Let us praise Jesus
'cause we're all precious in His name.

1411
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:57,983
Precious.

1412
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,654
Precious?

1413
01:19:02,656 --> 01:19:03,989
- To all the congregation here...
- Precious.

1414
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:07,409
...there's something I need to tell you.

1415
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,244
I did invest the money...

1416
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:13,374
Precious!

1417
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,917
Somebody's got the Holy Ghost.

1418
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:20,089
I know!

1419
01:19:21,049 --> 01:19:23,509
- You know?
- I know!

1420
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:25,552
The same know that I know?

1421
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,137
I know!

1422
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:28,305
That man knows!

1423
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,224
- You know?
- I know!

1424
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:33,560
- How much do you know?
- Do you think that he knows now?

1425
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:35,521
- I'm not hot, I just know.
- Praise the Lord!

1426
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:36,855
Yes!

1427
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,732
AII right, George, you want to try
to explain this to me?

1428
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:39,942
Yeah.

1429
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:42,111
There was a woman
named Precious Jackson

1430
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:44,113
that Walter always told me about. Okay?

1431
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:47,074
Now I've Iooked at these accounts
and they all start with a Ietter.

1432
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,868
The Ietters spell out "Precious Jackson."

1433
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:52,788
It's all encrypted, right here.

1434
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:55,207
What the hell are you talking about?

1435
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,376
The Ietters spell out...

1436
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,002
Okay, I'm a Iittle confused
by this, too.

1437
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:01,380
It's the name the account is in.

1438
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,006
Okay.

1439
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:06,301
Just follow this, 'cause it took some doing

1440
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:09,221
to follow the money trail
from the Cayman Islands and Germany.

1441
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:14,768
But the trail goes cold when the money
goes into a Swiss account. Okay?

1442
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:18,731
Now, they were all given a Ietter
when they went in and came out.

1443
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:20,607
- Right?
- Okay.

1444
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:24,486
But every month on this date,

1445
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:27,948
as the funds go into this Swiss account,

1446
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:31,034
this account in the US sees a deposit.

1447
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,872
Now I balance the two, and it's exactly 10 %

1448
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:38,876
that resurfaces in the US
in this account every month

1449
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,628
to a Iady named Precious Jackson.

1450
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:44,006
What is 10 % gonna do?

1451
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,633
Of 600 million?

1452
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:49,344
That's six million!

1453
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:50,554
Jake.

1454
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:55,434
It's 60 million.

1455
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,269
- Sixty.
- Sixty.

1456
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:59,354
George.

1457
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:01,023
I can get the church's money back.

1458
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:04,234
- Praise God.
- Yes, you and all the charities.

1459
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:06,403
- Can this really work?
- Yes, it can work.

1460
01:21:06,488 --> 01:21:07,863
Why would Walter take this money

1461
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:10,783
and put it in an account with
some woman's name who never touches it?

1462
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:15,162
Well, either he didn't tell her about it,
or she doesn't exist.

1463
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:18,665
So what I'll do is I'll get a federal warrant,

1464
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,292
we'll get the account seized.

1465
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,337
I'm pretty sure once I bring this to the judge,
you'll be able to get probation.

1466
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:24,463
That's a great job.

1467
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:27,758
But, Brian, we can get this money
back to the people it belongs to.

1468
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,843
It's sitting right here in this account.

1469
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:32,137
You didn't just say that to me.
I'm an officer of the court.

1470
01:21:32,222 --> 01:21:34,223
I don't even know what you're thinking.
I didn't hear that.

1471
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:36,725
I don't even want to know
what you're thinking. No. No, no, no.

1472
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:38,310
- Brian.
- Not having this conversation.

1473
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:39,812
- I'm out of here.
- Please. Come on.

1474
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:41,522
- I will see you at the office tomorrow...
- Brian.

1475
01:21:41,606 --> 01:21:42,606
...bright and early, George.

1476
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,982
- Thank you so much.
- Brian. Please.

1477
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,108
Bye.

1478
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:49,655
I've come too close to give up now, okay?
I'm not calling it quits.

1479
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:52,407
I'm gonna get that money
back to the charities.

1480
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:55,536
Right? I want my Iife back.

1481
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:58,956
And here is where I start to take action.

1482
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:03,210
So you're either with me or you're not,
but I'm not giving up without a fight.

1483
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:07,297
So what's it gonna be,
Mr. I'm-a-tough-guy-from-the-hood?

1484
01:22:07,382 --> 01:22:10,300
Mr. You-going-down-homie?

1485
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:13,637
'Cause I'll tell you,
I'm gonna do the damn thing.

1486
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:15,514
So you're with me or what?

1487
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:17,641
I'm with you.

1488
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:19,852
- Gucci!
- Yeah.

1489
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:22,855
With you.

1490
01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:29,945
You okay?

1491
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:32,114
I will be.

1492
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:35,075
George, what's going on?

1493
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,786
I screwed up, that's what's going on.

1494
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:40,414
And now there's a big wrong
that I have to right.

1495
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:44,793
And I just have to figure out
how I'm gonna do it.

1496
01:22:44,878 --> 01:22:47,212
But I'm gonna do it. I am gonna do it.

1497
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:51,466
George, I haven't seen this much fire in you
since we got married.

1498
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:54,219
Well, maybe it's Iong overdue, huh?

1499
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:58,724
Do you remember
our honeymoon in Florence?

1500
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:02,728
- I remember it rained every day.
- It did.

1501
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,563
And do you remember, you said,

1502
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:07,733
"What if our marriage is
nothing but full of rainy days?"

1503
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:09,902
I might have been joking.

1504
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:12,821
But I remember
you still got upset, didn't you?

1505
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:14,489
- I did.
- Yeah.

1506
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:15,782
And what did you say?

1507
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,410
I said,

1508
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,788
"Rain does make things grow."

1509
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:23,665
Exactly.

1510
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:26,877
What if all this happened for a reason?

1511
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:28,921
For you and I
to get to know each other again,

1512
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:32,341
for our family to get closer, for us to grow?

1513
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,344
What if it did?

1514
01:23:36,429 --> 01:23:39,181
Kate, you are amazing.

1515
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:42,684
I swear to you, I'm gonna make things right.

1516
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:45,395
I have no doubt.

1517
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,564
Honey, you always do the right thing.

1518
01:23:47,649 --> 01:23:49,274
I Iove you so much.

1519
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:51,109
I Iove you, too.

1520
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:54,655
I'm so proud of you, George.

1521
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:57,991
That's good.

1522
01:23:58,117 --> 01:23:59,618
I'm closing an account.

1523
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:04,623
Rita, it looks like you'll be
withdrawing $4 million from us today.

1524
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:05,791
$4 million?

1525
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,834
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1526
01:24:08,378 --> 01:24:10,212
Well, how would you like that?

1527
01:24:10,964 --> 01:24:12,047
10s and 20s?

1528
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:15,175
Hey, son. We watching Ghost.

1529
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,803
She's gonna walk up in a bank
and act Iike she somebody else.

1530
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:19,096
Look at that.

1531
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:21,890
You know we require identification
and all that.

1532
01:24:21,975 --> 01:24:25,352
Rita Miller or Oda Mae Jones,
she don't even know what her name is.

1533
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:29,356
Rita Miller. That's my name.

1534
01:24:29,816 --> 01:24:31,566
My name. Rita Miller.

1535
01:24:33,945 --> 01:24:35,445
My name.

1536
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:38,240
The check.

1537
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:40,951
Here you are.

1538
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:46,540
What the hell you Iooking at me
Iike the Iast virgin for?

1539
01:24:51,379 --> 01:24:53,380
Now Iet me make sure I got this right.

1540
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:55,882
Y'all want me to get on the aeroplane,

1541
01:24:55,967 --> 01:24:59,344
go out to New York City and go in a bank
and pretend to be Precious Jackson?

1542
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:01,888
Is that right?

1543
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:03,056
Yes.

1544
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:08,061
Does Brian know anything about this?

1545
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:10,647
- No.
- He thinks you both could go to jail.

1546
01:25:10,732 --> 01:25:12,816
Well, I could be going to jail anyway.

1547
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,193
That's all right. Just don't drop the soap,
you'll be fine.

1548
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:17,988
I been up in there. You might have to
fight a Iittle bit, kick a Iittle ass.

1549
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:19,156
But you'll be all right.

1550
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,241
If you don't kick no ass,
they gonna take your ass.

1551
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:22,701
But you'll be all right.

1552
01:25:23,786 --> 01:25:25,662
I don't know about this, though.
I don't feel good about this.

1553
01:25:25,747 --> 01:25:27,456
I just don't... I don't know. I don't know.

1554
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,624
Madea, it's easy.

1555
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:32,377
It's just as easy as it was in the movie.

1556
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:35,047
Whoopi Goldberg had a dead white man
helping her

1557
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:36,673
all through that whole movie.

1558
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:38,008
I'll help you.

1559
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:40,218
You alive. I said dead!

1560
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:41,595
George, you cannot go to New York.

1561
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:42,763
Honey, I have to.

1562
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,973
You can't. They're still after you.
Are you crazy?

1563
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:46,850
I'll disguise myself somehow.

1564
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:48,894
They won't know me. Okay? It'll be fine.

1565
01:25:48,978 --> 01:25:50,687
- No, I can't do that.
- Madea.

1566
01:25:50,772 --> 01:25:52,814
Please, I know you can do it.

1567
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:54,941
You say this is for charity?

1568
01:25:55,068 --> 01:25:57,444
And for the church? Right, Jake?
For the church? It's for the church?

1569
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:00,072
It's for the church, for your daddy
get the money back for the church?

1570
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:03,116
AII right. Now my question then becomes,

1571
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:06,203
all these beautiful people
that got these charities

1572
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:09,247
and helping all these children
and feeding the people around the world,

1573
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:12,459
it's for that, that's wonderful,
but I have a question for you.

1574
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,505
What the hell in it for me?

1575
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:20,592
Madea, you'll feel a Iot better about yourself.

1576
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:24,930
I always feel good about myself.
Hell, I was born 6'2".

1577
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:26,973
237 pounds.

1578
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,685
I have always been this big all my Iife.
I went to kindergarten this big.

1579
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:33,146
I had to have high self-esteem.
I feel good about myself.

1580
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:35,482
Ain't nothing you gonna tell me
gonna make me feel good about myself.

1581
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,526
You give me some money,
that'll make me feel good about myself.

1582
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:39,903
Okay, you know what?

1583
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:42,948
Can we figure that out after this is done?

1584
01:26:43,783 --> 01:26:45,951
George, have you ever hired a ho?

1585
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,789
No. No.

1586
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:53,917
She want her money first.
Do you understand?

1587
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:55,335
I need to get some money first.

1588
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,672
Don't perform no services
until the money's on the table.

1589
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:04,386
You know what? I'll do it. I will do it.

1590
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,929
AII I got to do is go in there

1591
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:08,140
and give them a bunch of accounts
to transfer the money to?

1592
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:09,474
- Yes.
- 12 accounts?

1593
01:27:09,559 --> 01:27:10,934
I just give them the information
to do the transfer?

1594
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:12,269
That's it. That's all.

1595
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:13,436
AII right, I'll do it.

1596
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:16,815
Then I will gladly do it. So he just
gonna wire the money to the accounts?

1597
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:19,192
- Yes.
- Okay, fine.

1598
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:21,486
Come on, Iet's go. Where's my purse?
Y'all get my purse.

1599
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:23,697
Joe, where's my purse?
We've got to go up to New York.

1600
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:25,782
You know what? If you guys are gonna go,

1601
01:27:25,867 --> 01:27:27,951
she can't Iook Iike this,
she can't be wearing that.

1602
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:29,494
- Right.
- What's wrong with what I got on?

1603
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:34,124
This came from Aretha Franklin.
Aretha gave me this.

1604
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,876
And y'all know Aretha can dress.

1605
01:27:36,002 --> 01:27:38,587
You've seen Aretha,
she makes fashion statements.

1606
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:41,173
How about Barbara, Cindy and I
give you a makeover?

1607
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:46,386
Introducing Precious Jackson.

1608
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:07,699
Wow.

1609
01:28:09,744 --> 01:28:10,869
This might work.

1610
01:28:11,204 --> 01:28:14,497
No. I don't know what the hell
y'all are thinking.

1611
01:28:14,582 --> 01:28:17,209
You Iook Iike a big ass bottle
of Pepto-Bismol.

1612
01:28:34,769 --> 01:28:37,229
- Can I give you a hand, sir?
- Yes. The Iuggage.

1613
01:28:37,313 --> 01:28:38,730
The airport.

1614
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,941
This bag. This way.

1615
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:42,567
- Here we go?
- Yeah.

1616
01:28:42,652 --> 01:28:43,902
Okay.

1617
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:46,071
Going to the airport.

1618
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:47,989
- Right this way, ma'am.
- AII right, I'll follow you.

1619
01:28:48,074 --> 01:28:50,575
You ain't got to rush me,
I know where the hell I'm going.

1620
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:53,745
The airport. A Iot of people here.

1621
01:28:54,247 --> 01:28:55,664
I'm nervous. I need to relax.

1622
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:57,207
Well, there's nothing to be nervous about.

1623
01:28:57,291 --> 01:29:00,669
It's just Iike riding in a car,
except you're 30,000 feet higher.

1624
01:29:00,753 --> 01:29:03,380
Cars don't crash from 30,000 feet, George.

1625
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:06,883
You need something to calm your nerves,
I got that old wee-wee.

1626
01:29:06,968 --> 01:29:08,593
Hey, what does that mean, drugs?

1627
01:29:08,678 --> 01:29:09,928
- Is that drugs?
- I know you ain't got no drugs.

1628
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:11,096
- No drugs.
- If you got...

1629
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,514
I'm gonna beat your ass
if you got them drugs.

1630
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:13,682
You don't bring no drugs up in here.

1631
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,600
- They got sniffing dogs up in here.
- No drugs.

1632
01:29:15,685 --> 01:29:18,186
Y'all go through.
I'm not going through with y'all.

1633
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:20,522
I'm not going through.
Excuse me, y'all. Excuse me.

1634
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:23,191
- I'm not going through with them at all.
- Madame, you are making a scene.

1635
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:25,860
- Watch yourself. Watch yourself, here.
- That's a no, no.

1636
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:30,448
Y'all go on.
I don't know them. I don't know them.

1637
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,951
Hi. Hi. A Iittle scary.

1638
01:29:33,286 --> 01:29:35,620
When I'm finished doing,
this gonna be the bomb.

1639
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:38,456
- Don't say "bomb." Don't say "bomb."
- What is the bomb?

1640
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:40,792
- No, no, no.
- Don't say...

1641
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,711
Hey, he don't want me saying "bomb."

1642
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:43,962
Okay.

1643
01:29:46,007 --> 01:29:48,591
What do I do, just give him the ticket?

1644
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:50,218
And show him my ID?

1645
01:29:50,303 --> 01:29:52,429
- Okay.
- That's the way.

1646
01:29:52,513 --> 01:29:54,514
Okay, that's me, and that's my ticket.

1647
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,267
- That is the way.
- Okay, thank you so much.

1648
01:29:57,351 --> 01:29:59,185
AII right.

1649
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:01,563
Now what y'all doing?

1650
01:30:01,647 --> 01:30:03,940
- What y'all doing?
- Taking off our shoes.

1651
01:30:04,025 --> 01:30:06,943
Take off your personal items
and put them in the tray.

1652
01:30:07,028 --> 01:30:09,612
What they gonna do
with my personal items?

1653
01:30:09,697 --> 01:30:10,864
Baby, I can't take off my shoe.

1654
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:13,199
Do you know how hard it is for
a woman my size to take off her shoes?

1655
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:14,659
I'm supposed to take off my shoes?

1656
01:30:14,785 --> 01:30:15,952
Yes, ma'am.

1657
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:19,456
What the hell do I need
to be taking my shoes off for?

1658
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:22,917
Baby, when you're this big,
it's hard to take your shoes off.

1659
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:24,002
That's all I'm saying.

1660
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,130
Take them off, but I don't know who the hell
gonna help me put them back on.

1661
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:29,341
Y'all so serious.

1662
01:30:33,721 --> 01:30:35,347
Watch that now.

1663
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,643
There you go.

1664
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:43,355
Oh, Lord. And you just
push it through there?

1665
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:45,815
- Now what I do? What I do?
- Right this way.

1666
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,108
Right this way.

1667
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:49,652
Okay. I'm gonna come on
through this thing.

1668
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,699
- What the hell is that?
- Just step over here, please, ma'am.

1669
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:55,992
What was that?

1670
01:30:56,077 --> 01:30:57,410
Just step over here through the scanner.

1671
01:30:58,496 --> 01:30:59,913
- What'd you want me to do?
- Step through here, please.

1672
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:02,707
- Okay, all right.
- Right through the scanner.

1673
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,918
Now what am I supposed to do?
This ain't gonna drop me down?

1674
01:31:05,044 --> 01:31:07,087
Just go and put your feet
in the footsteps, please.

1675
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:10,715
That's really wide. You want me to put
both my feet where these yellow feet?

1676
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,050
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's really wide.

1677
01:31:12,176 --> 01:31:14,552
My Iegs ain't been open that wide
since I had my daughter.

1678
01:31:16,222 --> 01:31:18,848
George, they want me to spread my Iegs.

1679
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,475
Okay, fine.

1680
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:22,769
- Now what?
- Put your hands over your head, please.

1681
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:24,020
- Like this?
- That's it.

1682
01:31:24,105 --> 01:31:26,564
Hands over your head.

1683
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,983
Wow, this is really sexual.

1684
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:31,653
Reminds me back of my stripping days.

1685
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:34,072
They used to call me Magnitude.

1686
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,242
You see anything?

1687
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:40,578
Can I have you step outside, please?

1688
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:42,038
Step outside.

1689
01:31:42,123 --> 01:31:43,206
Right this way. Put your hands down.

1690
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:45,041
- Can I close my Iegs?
- Yes, please.

1691
01:31:45,126 --> 01:31:47,085
Okay, thank you so much.

1692
01:31:47,795 --> 01:31:49,504
- Now what?
- Stand right over here, please.

1693
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:51,673
- Yes.
- I'm just gonna do a quick pat down.

1694
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:53,466
- On my body?
- Yes.

1695
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:55,218
- Go ahead and raise your hands.
- Am I under arrest?

1696
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:56,719
- No, ma'am.
- Why you patting me down?

1697
01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:58,680
- Just standard procedure.
- A standard...

1698
01:31:58,764 --> 01:32:00,849
- I got to do all this to get on the airplane?
- Yes, please.

1699
01:32:00,933 --> 01:32:03,101
George, I got to do all this
to get on the airplane?

1700
01:32:03,227 --> 01:32:06,229
Ma'am, it's just standard procedure.
I need you to put your hands up, please.

1701
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:08,898
- Thank you.
- Go on, pat me down.

1702
01:32:08,983 --> 01:32:10,108
Now, wait a minute.

1703
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:13,361
You gonna find a roadmap to heaven.
You better come on from up there now.

1704
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:14,821
Come on up.

1705
01:32:15,823 --> 01:32:17,115
Turn around.

1706
01:32:17,241 --> 01:32:18,450
Can I put my hands down?

1707
01:32:18,576 --> 01:32:21,244
Now wait. Now what the hell you doing?

1708
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:22,954
Boy.

1709
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:26,249
Something back here
that you wanna tell me about?

1710
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:29,919
Yes, that's my ass.
It's from wall-to-wall in this skirt.

1711
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:34,090
We're clear. Go right ahead.

1712
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:37,886
You need to buy me a cigarette or a drink
or something after doing all that to me.

1713
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,012
You don't know me.

1714
01:32:39,138 --> 01:32:40,722
I ain't felt that many hands
all over my body

1715
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:42,182
since I got off that train from Mexico.

1716
01:32:42,308 --> 01:32:43,808
Where's my purse and my shoes?

1717
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:52,400
Anybody ever told you
you Iook Iike Beyoncé?

1718
01:32:52,485 --> 01:32:53,485
No.

1719
01:32:53,611 --> 01:32:55,987
Madea, I found my wifey.

1720
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:00,074
Shut the hell up back there. You in coach.

1721
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:02,160
You ain't supposed to talk
to nobody in first class.

1722
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:04,746
Didn't you see Titanic?

1723
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:06,206
I'm nervous.

1724
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:08,166
I know. But behave.

1725
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,044
What the hell was that? What was that?

1726
01:33:12,338 --> 01:33:14,506
There better not be no terrorer on this plane.
Is there a terrorer?

1727
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,675
Is there terrorer on here?
Better not be no terrorer.

1728
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:20,345
Madea, it's a bump. Bump, bump.

1729
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:22,263
What the hell a bump doing in the air?
Bumps are on the road.

1730
01:33:22,348 --> 01:33:24,265
- That's all.
- Bumps ain't in the air. Hell.

1731
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:26,851
This thing just makes me nervous.
I don't Iike being on this thing.

1732
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:30,772
I got to pee. I need something to relax me.
Calm me down.

1733
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:32,148
What do you want? What do you want?

1734
01:33:32,233 --> 01:33:34,692
I want a joint.

1735
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:38,071
- You need that good-good, Madea?
- Boy, shut up.

1736
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:40,198
Just get me a drink. Can I get a drink?

1737
01:33:40,324 --> 01:33:42,575
Can they get a Iady a drink?
Can a colored woman get a drink?

1738
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,035
I'll get a flight attendant.

1739
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:46,829
I'll get her. Flight attendant?

1740
01:33:46,914 --> 01:33:50,708
Flight attendant? Flight attendant?
Flight attendant?

1741
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,669
Ma'am, are you okay?

1742
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:55,880
You're making the other passengers
just a Iittle bit nervous, okay?

1743
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,090
I would Iike something to drink, please.

1744
01:33:57,216 --> 01:33:59,050
'Cause I need something
to relax me just a Iittle bit.

1745
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:00,218
Okay. What would you Iike?

1746
01:34:00,344 --> 01:34:01,761
That depends. How much is it?

1747
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:03,304
You're in first class, it's free.

1748
01:34:03,389 --> 01:34:05,306
Okay. Well, bring me every damn thing
you got back there.

1749
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:06,432
If it's brown, pour it.

1750
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:29,914
Lord have mercy, I ain't never
seen no place Iike this before.

1751
01:34:30,624 --> 01:34:33,126
They call it the Big Apple, huh?

1752
01:34:33,586 --> 01:34:36,879
I wonder why they call it the Big Apple.
I don't see no apples.

1753
01:34:36,964 --> 01:34:39,048
- Do you see the apples anywhere?
- No.

1754
01:34:42,553 --> 01:34:45,722
I wanna see that thing, too,
that thing with the torch on it.

1755
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:48,850
The statue. The Statue of Limitations.

1756
01:34:49,727 --> 01:34:51,019
Lord, Iook at all these people.

1757
01:34:51,103 --> 01:34:52,937
I ain't never seen this many
people in one place

1758
01:34:53,022 --> 01:34:54,564
unless they be giving away
government cheese.

1759
01:34:54,648 --> 01:34:58,151
I don't understand why folk would be
all on top of each other Iike this.

1760
01:34:58,485 --> 01:35:00,653
This is too much.
I got to get back to Georgia.

1761
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:02,530
Come on,
Iet's go get this business done.

1762
01:35:10,998 --> 01:35:13,625
New York!

1763
01:35:13,709 --> 01:35:15,543
Yes indeed, y'all. This is nice.

1764
01:35:15,628 --> 01:35:17,754
- Yeah, I'm in New York, baby.
- How you doing?

1765
01:35:17,838 --> 01:35:19,631
Hello, madame. May I take your bags?

1766
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:21,799
- Where you gonna take it?
- I'll take it to your room, if you Iike.

1767
01:35:21,884 --> 01:35:25,470
- No. No. No, no.
- She is world-traveled.

1768
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:29,140
She never think about the Iuggage.

1769
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:30,391
I don't think about no Iuggage.

1770
01:35:30,476 --> 01:35:33,728
I don't think about no Iuggage
or the garbage or none of that stuff.

1771
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:35,063
- This way.
- Okay.

1772
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:37,565
Well, get on out of the way there.
Let a Iady pass.

1773
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:40,902
You in the way, George, move.
Let them open the door for me.

1774
01:35:44,615 --> 01:35:46,783
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1775
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:51,079
This place is Iovely. Hello.
Welcome. Thank you. Welcome.

1776
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:53,498
Welcome to me. My first time here.

1777
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:55,416
Hello. Hello.

1778
01:35:55,501 --> 01:35:59,545
They take dogs. Well, Oprah Winfrey
must stay here. Is she here?

1779
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:01,130
This is Iovely.

1780
01:36:01,215 --> 01:36:03,925
Run into me one more time,
and I'm gonna knock the hell out of you.

1781
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:06,511
What the hell's wrong with you?

1782
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:08,346
Good afternoon, sir.

1783
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:11,349
A reservation for Jackson.

1784
01:36:11,433 --> 01:36:14,185
- Of course. Good afternoon, madam.

1785
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:15,603
I have the reservation.

1786
01:36:15,688 --> 01:36:18,314
I have your

1787
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:20,191
And here are your keys.

1788
01:36:21,235 --> 01:36:25,113
And if you would be so kind as to sign here

1789
01:36:25,197 --> 01:36:26,739
But of course.

1790
01:36:26,824 --> 01:36:28,825

1791
01:36:28,909 --> 01:36:30,660

01:36:30,744 --> 01:36:33,204
Yes. The reservation

1793
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:35,957
That is my name.
I'm one of the Jackson family.

1794
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:38,543
- Well, really? That's wonderful, madam.
- Yes, yes.

1795
01:36:38,627 --> 01:36:39,961
Yes. Excellent.

1796
01:36:40,045 --> 01:36:43,715
Well, it was La Toya
and Rebbie and me. Yeah.

1797
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:45,466
- And Janet. Little Janet.
- Wonderful.

1798
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:48,386
- We are so proud to have you here, madam.
- Thank you so much.

1799
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,638
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1800
01:36:50,723 --> 01:36:52,890
Back the hell up. Thank you.

1801
01:36:52,975 --> 01:36:57,729
If I have a phone call from Janet or La Toya
or Rebbie Jackson...

1802
01:36:57,813 --> 01:36:59,522
- Yes, madam?
- ...please put them through.

1803
01:36:59,606 --> 01:37:01,941
- They're always calling me, all the time.
- I see.

1804
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:03,943
'Cause they need makeup tips and advice.

1805
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,653
- I'll put them right through to your room.
- Yes, thanks.

1806
01:37:05,738 --> 01:37:07,447
- I will do that, madam. Yes.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

1807
01:37:07,531 --> 01:37:10,658
- Shall we go?
- The elevators are to your Ieft.

1808
01:37:10,743 --> 01:37:12,618
And I do hope you enjoy your stay.

1809
01:37:12,703 --> 01:37:14,412
- Well, yes, we will. Thank you so much.
- Yes, wonderful.

1810
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,330
- Thank you so much.
- Don't fall over.

1811
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:20,543
You hit me with these bags one more time,
I will knock the hell out of you.

1812
01:37:20,627 --> 01:37:22,545
- What's in here?
- Get the hell on the elevator.

1813
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:24,046
You got two midgets in here.

1814
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:30,636
If Randy or Jermaine or Tito call,

1815
01:37:30,721 --> 01:37:34,640
tell them I just cannot talk right now,
I'm gonna have to call them Iater.

1816
01:37:34,725 --> 01:37:35,892
Very good, madam. I have that.

1817
01:37:35,976 --> 01:37:37,518
What the hell you
pulling me for, George?

1818
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:44,484
I know how to open the door, here. This...

1819
01:37:45,027 --> 01:37:46,694
This is nice.

1820
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:50,615
Oh, Lord, this furniture nice.

1821
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,825
Ain't got no plastic on it.
Can't be too nice, though.

1822
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,577
- How you doing?
- Good.

1823
01:37:54,661 --> 01:37:57,038
- Wonderful. Hello.
- Hello.

1824
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:59,457
Your chocolate.

1825
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:01,542
Yes, I know I'm chocolate.

1826
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:06,380
That's a new way of saying "black"?
I'm chocolate, yes. African-American.

1827
01:38:06,882 --> 01:38:11,886
Forgive madame.
She is, how you say, preoccupée.

1828
01:38:12,346 --> 01:38:15,598
You gonna stop calling me madame.
My name is Madea, not madame.

1829
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:17,433
Zip it.

1830
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:21,062
- For you, monsieur. Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1831
01:38:22,606 --> 01:38:23,856
What the hell was he just
standing up here for,

1832
01:38:23,941 --> 01:38:25,566
just Iooking all scary and weird?

1833
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:26,901
I thought I had
checked into the Bates Motel.

1834
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:27,985
He's standing there Iike that.

1835
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,696
- What was he waiting for?
- A gratuity.

1836
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:33,574
- What is that?
- A tip.

1837
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:35,743
Why didn't you just say "tip"?
I know what the hell a tip is.

1838
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:38,955
Now, George, how much did you just
give that man? You gave him paper money.

1839
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:40,957
- How much was that?
- Twenty.

1840
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,501
Twenty what?

1841
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:45,127
Dollars. $20.

1842
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:47,922
Have you Iost your mind, George?

1843
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:50,466
Waiter! Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

1844
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:54,303
Hello, mister. Can I talk to you
forjust a second?

1845
01:38:54,388 --> 01:38:56,639
Mister? I'm tired as hell.

1846
01:38:56,723 --> 01:38:59,725
Here. Hold this for me, baby,
and Iet me hold that. That's $20.

1847
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:02,979
Baby, Iisten, if we wanted that for chocolate,
we'd go get us a Snickers.

1848
01:39:03,063 --> 01:39:04,105
Here's your tip.

1849
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:06,107
Pardon, monsieur, she is...

1850
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:11,195
- Movez-vous. Movez-vous.
- Go on. Go on. $20?

1851
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,866
Would you get a grip?
You've got to play the part.

1852
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:17,201
Trust me. Appearance is everything. Okay?

1853
01:39:17,286 --> 01:39:18,494
Now, we need to get some rest

1854
01:39:18,579 --> 01:39:21,581
so we can get to the bank early
and get out of here.

1855
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:23,332
That's fine.
Let's get some rest, then, George.

1856
01:39:23,417 --> 01:39:25,835
But you ain't gonna give no $20 to nobody.
That's just damn crazy.

1857
01:39:25,919 --> 01:39:28,212
Child, if Joe could see me now.

1858
01:39:30,507 --> 01:39:32,508
This mattress is nice.

1859
01:39:33,677 --> 01:39:36,095
No, can't Iay down flat Iike that.

1860
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:40,725
Yeah. Women who is well-endowed
can't Iay flat.

1861
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:43,477
'Cause them breasts will
sneak up around your neck

1862
01:39:43,562 --> 01:39:45,855
and choke the hell out of you
through the night.

1863
01:39:45,939 --> 01:39:48,524
Got to throw them over to the side.

1864
01:39:49,693 --> 01:39:51,152
This is nice.

1865
01:39:52,863 --> 01:39:54,822
Silk.

1866
01:39:57,826 --> 01:39:59,619
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1867
01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:01,370
Now remember, you're Precious Jackson,

1868
01:40:01,455 --> 01:40:04,415
and you wanna get all the money
transferred into the 12 accounts.

1869
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:06,000
You can't keep running this
over and over again.

1870
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:08,461
- You're gonna make me forget everything.
- Okay. This is it. This is it.

1871
01:40:08,545 --> 01:40:10,212
I understand.
You gonna make me forget everything.

1872
01:40:10,297 --> 01:40:11,672
I can't keep doing this over and over again.

1873
01:40:11,757 --> 01:40:13,758
- Just relax.
- AII right, I got it.

1874
01:40:13,842 --> 01:40:17,887
I'm relaxed, George, I'm relaxed.
But you tensing me the hell up.

1875
01:40:17,971 --> 01:40:19,972
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

1876
01:40:20,057 --> 01:40:22,183
- Got it?
- I got it. I got it.

1877
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:28,564
Madea.

1878
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:31,442
Yes?

1879
01:40:32,402 --> 01:40:37,865
Remember, the man you're meeting,
his name is Jack Goldenberg.

1880
01:40:38,992 --> 01:40:41,243
What the hell you speaking
a French accent for, George?

1881
01:40:41,328 --> 01:40:42,453
This is me and you talking.

1882
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:43,996
Hell, I know how to speak French, too.

1883
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:47,249
Shut the hell up.

1884
01:40:47,334 --> 01:40:51,087
I got it. Jack Goldenberg.

1885
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:52,838
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1886
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:57,593
Excuse me while I do my Tyra Banks.

1887
01:41:12,526 --> 01:41:13,734
Hello.

1888
01:41:16,071 --> 01:41:19,740
Can you help me?
I'm here to see Whoopi Goldberg.

1889
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:22,243
Excuse me?

1890
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:27,915
Silly me. I'm sorry.
I was just watching The View.

1891
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,796
I'm here to see Jack Goldenberg.
Jack Goldenberg.

1892
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,173
- May I tell him who's here?
- Yes...

1893
01:41:37,342 --> 01:41:40,219
I'm sorry, I was about to say,
"What a mighty God we serve."

1894
01:41:41,847 --> 01:41:45,599
Precious Jackson is my name.
I'm a part of the Jackson family.

1895
01:41:45,684 --> 01:41:48,102
Yes. But, you know,
they put me on the outskirts.

1896
01:41:48,186 --> 01:41:50,730
- So now, it's just me and Bubbles.
- Bubbles.

1897
01:41:50,856 --> 01:41:52,106
- Yeah, yeah.
- That the monkey?

1898
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:53,649
- Yeah, great Iittle monkey.
- Oh, my God.

1899
01:41:53,734 --> 01:41:57,528
Yeah. I call him Joe,
but everybody else calls him Bubbles.

1900
01:41:58,864 --> 01:42:00,239
You certainly do have an appointment.

1901
01:42:01,283 --> 01:42:03,701
Precious Jackson to see you.

1902
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:06,620
Hello. Hi. Thank you so much, Magdalene.

1903
01:42:06,705 --> 01:42:08,289
- It's so great to see you.
- How can I help you?

1904
01:42:08,373 --> 01:42:12,001
Jack, I called you.

1905
01:42:12,085 --> 01:42:15,588
We spoke about all the transfers
that I need to do.

1906
01:42:15,714 --> 01:42:19,717
I got that request Iast evening. Let me see.

1907
01:42:19,801 --> 01:42:23,179
Jack, can we do this? I'd Iike
to add one more account to that.

1908
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:26,265
Because I'm feeling so generous
and I've given to so many charities.

1909
01:42:26,391 --> 01:42:29,602
Here is the account number.
I know that's 12, this'll be the 13th.

1910
01:42:29,895 --> 01:42:31,812
- Thirteenth?
- Yes.

1911
01:42:31,897 --> 01:42:35,483
And, of course, in this economic climate,
you're gonna need my identification.

1912
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:37,026
Precious Jackson. Here you are.

1913
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:38,736
- Well, thank you.
- Okay.

1914
01:42:40,572 --> 01:42:42,031
She's been in there way too Iong.

1915
01:42:42,115 --> 01:42:44,116
She's not. She hasn't been,
and she's doing a mission.

1916
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:46,202
Very dangerous work she's doing.

1917
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:48,621
You're just...
You know what? You're such a...

1918
01:42:48,747 --> 01:42:51,457
I'd hate to be cliff-diving with you.

1919
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:01,050
Look, I saw this in a movie once.

1920
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:03,552
You go east, I go west,
we meet in the subway.

1921
01:43:03,637 --> 01:43:04,678
We'll make it out alive.

1922
01:43:04,763 --> 01:43:07,723
I'm not running with you. Okay?

1923
01:43:07,808 --> 01:43:11,018
I'm not running down the street
Iike some biatch.

1924
01:43:11,103 --> 01:43:13,062
Like some biatch, okay?

1925
01:43:13,146 --> 01:43:15,397
Wait. What are you talking about, fool?

1926
01:43:15,482 --> 01:43:17,650
I'm committed to see this through.

1927
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:19,819
You know what they'll do with you
with that mustache in jail?

1928
01:43:19,945 --> 01:43:21,779
You better not snitch.

1929
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:24,073
- Please.
- You kill me.

1930
01:43:24,157 --> 01:43:25,241
- There she is.
- Oh, my goodness.

1931
01:43:25,325 --> 01:43:28,536
- Jack, you kill me.
- Now, our cover.

1932
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,995
- Yes, thank you.
- She got it.

1933
01:43:30,122 --> 01:43:33,707
But if there's anything else you need,
you call Jack Goldenberg directly.

1934
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:35,501
I certainly will. I certainly will.

1935
01:43:35,836 --> 01:43:37,628
- May I help you?
- Oh, you're delightful.

1936
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:39,839
- What a Iovely woman.
- No. I've got it. I've got it.

1937
01:43:39,965 --> 01:43:42,091
You got to stop flirting with me.
You ain't getting nothing.

1938
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:45,010
I see you Iooking at my ass.
Don't you do that. Don't you do that.

1939
01:43:45,137 --> 01:43:47,179
- I would never do that.
- Stop that flirting with me.

1940
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:49,306
- What a woman. What a woman.
- Thank you so much.

1941
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:51,809
- I'll see you Iater. AII right.
- Well, our pleasure again.

1942
01:43:51,935 --> 01:43:53,144
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

1943
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:55,020
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1944
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:09,160
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

1945
01:44:09,828 --> 01:44:11,620
Well, what did he say?

1946
01:44:11,997 --> 01:44:17,710
Well, he's not very happy and neither am I
that you took my aunt up to New York.

1947
01:44:17,836 --> 01:44:19,545
To that bank. That's crazy.

1948
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:22,923
But he's getting a Iot of calls
from the charities, they're very happy.

1949
01:44:23,008 --> 01:44:26,677
The press is very excited about it,
so he's okay, and so am I.

1950
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:29,930
Well, what does that mean for me?

1951
01:44:30,015 --> 01:44:33,434
You've helped us gather enough information
and evidence against your former bosses

1952
01:44:33,518 --> 01:44:35,686
that we got a pretty solid case.

1953
01:44:35,812 --> 01:44:37,396
With that information, we pressured them,

1954
01:44:37,522 --> 01:44:39,481
and they've agreed to testify
against the Malone family,

1955
01:44:39,566 --> 01:44:40,608
so they won't be after you.

1956
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:44,195
So we just talked about
dropping the charges against you.

1957
01:44:44,738 --> 01:44:47,823
What you did,
getting those accounts back in order,

1958
01:44:47,908 --> 01:44:51,243
and having all that money wired
back to the charities, all 13 of them,

1959
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:54,288
it's really great.

1960
01:44:54,372 --> 01:44:58,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was.

1961
01:44:58,084 --> 01:44:59,376
You're free to go, George.

1962
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,378
- So I'm free?
- Yeah.

1963
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,547
Enjoy your Iife, George.

1964
01:45:03,632 --> 01:45:06,550
Take care of yourself.
Stay out of trouble.

1965
01:45:06,635 --> 01:45:15,142
Thank you.

1966
01:45:15,727 --> 01:45:17,228
The other way.

1967
01:45:18,355 --> 01:45:19,688
Thank you.

1968
01:45:21,983 --> 01:45:25,402
This has been Iovely.
It's just been so fun having y'all here.

1969
01:45:25,487 --> 01:45:27,738
Madea, thank you.

1970
01:45:27,864 --> 01:45:29,490
Thanks for everything.

1971
01:45:29,574 --> 01:45:32,326
You have no idea how much
I wanna say, "Get the hell out."

1972
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:35,329
But I'm holding that in, because
I'm showing so much Iove to you.

1973
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:36,830
I enjoyed having y'all here.

1974
01:45:36,915 --> 01:45:38,874
The best part about company
is when they Ieave.

1975
01:45:39,251 --> 01:45:41,377
I'm gonna miss you so much, Madea.

1976
01:45:41,753 --> 01:45:45,756
That's okay, child. AII them potatoes
in my house is glad you Ieaving.

1977
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,341
- Me, too.
- Yeah?

1978
01:45:47,425 --> 01:45:49,093
Can we come back and visit?

1979
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:53,430
That is so sweet.
You wanna come back and visit?

1980
01:45:53,515 --> 01:45:56,016
No, I don't think so. I'm sorry.

1981
01:45:56,101 --> 01:45:57,184
You can write me Ietters, though.

1982
01:45:57,269 --> 01:46:01,355
Long, Iong, Iong Ietters. Dissertations
from very, very, very far away.

1983
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:02,856
Negros.

1984
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:09,863
Okay, time to get her the hell out of here.

1985
01:46:09,948 --> 01:46:12,283
- Spirituals.
- Now she gets it.

1986
01:46:12,409 --> 01:46:15,619
Okay, Mom, Iet's go. One Iast time.

1987
01:46:15,704 --> 01:46:17,037
Let's go.

1988
01:46:18,415 --> 01:46:20,708
There's my boy. There's my boy.

1989
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:22,751
Bye, Joe. I'll be back.

1990
01:46:23,628 --> 01:46:26,130
I'll be back, Joe. Bye.

1991
01:46:26,256 --> 01:46:27,798
- Y'all, come on.
- Bye.

1992
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:29,800
Mabel, get them the hell out of here now.

1993
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:31,051
I'll see y'all around.

1994
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:33,470
Bye. Bye.

1995
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:34,930
- Bye.
- Bye.

1996
01:46:49,446 --> 01:46:50,446
Yes!

1997
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:05,294
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you, Son.

1998
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:43,040
Yeah!

1999
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:45,834
I did that. I got that money, baby.

2000
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:49,046
I got that money!

2001
01:47:54,302 --> 01:47:56,011
I don't want to go to prison,
because, you know?

2002
01:47:56,096 --> 01:47:58,180
Food is bad,
I'm probably gonna Iose weight.

2003
01:47:58,264 --> 01:48:01,058
Probably go down to nothing
and get gang-raped.

2004
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:03,060
I don't wanna shower in prison.

2005
01:48:03,144 --> 01:48:06,855
They can do strange things to you in prison.

2006
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:08,565
Do you understand? Do you understand?

2007
01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:12,945
I think I can handle myself. I really do.

2008
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:15,739
I really do. I just don't want
to go through the experience

2009
01:48:15,824 --> 01:48:17,908
of having to do that. Okay?

2010
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:20,411
I don't want to have to worry
about other guys in there.

2011
01:48:20,495 --> 01:48:23,789
When I get so mad,
I'm gonna have to use my fists,

2012
01:48:23,873 --> 01:48:26,291
you know, just to defend myself.

2013
01:48:26,376 --> 01:48:28,669
Go upstairs and get your mom's pills.

2014
01:48:28,753 --> 01:48:32,589
- Find a Iittle straitjacket and calm down...
- And a straitjacket, too.

2015
01:48:32,674 --> 01:48:34,299
Figure this out, Maysie.

2016
01:48:34,384 --> 01:48:35,843
And then you put in that fatback grease,

2017
01:48:35,927 --> 01:48:38,220
and you make sure it just sits there
and soak, so it'll be Iight.

2018
01:48:38,304 --> 01:48:39,680
I got some oatmeal on the stove,

2019
01:48:39,764 --> 01:48:41,849
and I got some greens
that's gonna clean you out.

2020
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:43,559
It's Iike none of this is gonna matter.

2021
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:46,103
AII right.

2022
01:48:46,187 --> 01:48:48,730
That's pretty good for never doing it.

2023
01:48:49,524 --> 01:48:50,774
Oh, boy.

2024
01:48:52,193 --> 01:48:54,570
- Is she doing it, too? Wow.
- Yeah.

2025
01:48:55,113 --> 01:48:57,030
She kept her promise.

2026
01:48:57,115 --> 01:48:59,074
- What the hell? Charlie Sheen.
- Hey. What a surprise.

2027
01:48:59,159 --> 01:49:01,493
How are you? Look who back here.
Look who back here hiding.

2028
01:49:01,578 --> 01:49:02,619
It's Charlie Sheen.

2029
01:49:02,704 --> 01:49:04,121
- Big fan.
- I'm a big fan of yours, too.

2030
01:49:04,205 --> 01:49:05,372
I've wanted to do this ever since... I'm sorry.

2031
01:49:05,457 --> 01:49:08,041
- That's freaky. That's freaky. That's freaky.
- Damn. Sorry, sorry.

2032
01:49:08,126 --> 01:49:10,711
Go on. Go on, rest yourself. Rest yourself.

2033
01:49:10,795 --> 01:49:13,255
- No motorboating. No motorboating.
- Cut.

2034
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:15,048
Where's Howie?

2035
01:49:15,133 --> 01:49:17,342
Oh, God, you don't even want to know
what happened to Howie.

2036
01:49:17,427 --> 01:49:19,052
It was so awful.

2037
01:49:19,137 --> 01:49:21,847
They just told me there was
a buffalo and a monkey somewhere,

2038
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:25,684
and I just have not been able to figure
how they got out of the zoo.

2039
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:27,269
I'm sorry.

2040
01:49:28,563 --> 01:49:31,190
I am 6'4" tall and a woman.

2041
01:49:31,274 --> 01:49:33,275
Do you think I have self-esteem issues?

2042
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:36,069
I ain't never played for the WNBA,
but I could.

2043
01:49:36,154 --> 01:49:37,946
I ain't got no self-esteem issues, hell.

2044
01:49:38,031 --> 01:49:41,700
I got a mustache. Do you understand?
I'm a dude up under this stuff.

2045
01:49:42,202 --> 01:49:46,121
Sorry, this is Precious Jackson.
I'm in the Presidential Suite.

2046
01:49:46,372 --> 01:49:49,583
And there are two toilets here.

2047
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:53,879
And I was trying to figure out,
which one am I supposed to use?

2048
01:49:53,963 --> 01:49:58,842
I don't know which one suits me best.
One of them has things on it Iike a faucet.

2049
01:49:59,469 --> 01:50:01,178
What is that for?

2050
01:50:03,765 --> 01:50:05,933
Yes, you know how you turn on the faucet.

2051
01:50:08,603 --> 01:50:11,313
I'm not a sir, I'm a ma'am.
You don't hear me, honey?

2052
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:15,526
Okay, yes, there's two toilets here.

2053
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:18,904
There's one that I recognize and
then there's one that I don't recognize.

2054
01:50:18,988 --> 01:50:22,824
It's got two handles on it, Iike you gonna
wash your hands or something.

2055
01:50:22,909 --> 01:50:24,743
A bidet? What is a bidet, honey?

2056
01:50:24,827 --> 01:50:28,705
I don't need Bengays and all that stuff.
Just trying to figure out what the toilet is.

2057
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:36,630
Right. Your hands?

2058
01:50:38,841 --> 01:50:40,884
It's for washing your ass?

2059
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:46,723
No, when I wanna wash my ass,
I take a bath, honey.

2060
01:50:46,808 --> 01:50:49,017
That's just nasty. Now who'd do that?

2061
01:50:51,896 --> 01:50:54,356
Listen, I didn't know
you were gonna answer the phone.

2062
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,942
I thought the phone was disconnected.
I'm so sorry.

2063
01:50:57,026 --> 01:50:59,403
Okay. I'll talk to you Iater. Bye.

2064
01:51:00,905 --> 01:51:02,322
There was actually somebody there?

2065
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:05,367
Yes. Yes, the whole time.

2066
01:51:05,451 --> 01:51:08,328
She was trying to explain to me what it was.

2067
01:51:08,788 --> 01:51:12,207
I'd Iike to order one of your famous...

2068
01:51:14,002 --> 01:51:17,629
Baby, this say hamburgers $45.
What the hell is on the burger?

2069
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:22,509
No, no, no. For $45,
there better be more than a hamburger.

2070
01:51:24,012 --> 01:51:28,390
For $45, it better get up in this bed
and roll around with me for a Iittle while.

2071
01:51:29,726 --> 01:51:32,102
You don't think that's funny. Okay.

2072
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:35,606
No. Do you have chicken wings?

2073
01:51:37,734 --> 01:51:38,775
You don't do those.

2074
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:41,945
Well, maybe you can ask the chef
to prepare them for me, then.

2075
01:51:43,031 --> 01:51:44,239
Yes.

2076
01:51:44,324 --> 01:51:48,577
How many would I Iike? That depends.
How many are there in the order?

2077
01:51:50,204 --> 01:51:54,124
Okay, seven chicken wings. Okay.
How much are the seven chicken wings?

2078
01:51:57,712 --> 01:51:59,087
$30 a wing?

2079
01:52:00,381 --> 01:52:02,341
30 damn dollars a wing?

2080
01:52:03,635 --> 01:52:06,219
You crazy as hell. People pay that?

2081
01:52:07,013 --> 01:52:09,806
No, honey, I can't.
$30 for a damn chicken wing?

2082
01:52:09,891 --> 01:52:11,391
Do you know that I can get 20 of them,

2083
01:52:11,476 --> 01:52:14,269
they come in a pack,
20 for $1 .99 down at Roscoe's?

2084
01:52:14,354 --> 01:52:17,439
I can't have this, honey.
No, I'm gonna starve in this hotel.

2085
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:23,070
My name is Precious Jackson.

2086
01:52:23,905 --> 01:52:26,698
My name is Melinda.

2087
01:52:27,367 --> 01:52:29,034
Hello, I'm Precious Jackson.

2088
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:31,953
Yo. Yo, what's up? I'm Precious.
They call me Precious.

2089
01:52:45,593 --> 01:52:48,178
I thought you were, you know,
some tough guy from the hood?

2090
01:52:48,262 --> 01:52:50,389
You know, "My biggest nightmare."

2091
01:52:50,473 --> 01:52:54,017
Thug Iife, fool. Thug Iife, fool.

2092
01:52:54,435 --> 01:52:57,270
Do me a favor. Send your old man
some money every now and then.

2093
01:52:57,355 --> 01:52:59,481
Just a Iittle something.
It ain't got to be nothing.

2094
01:52:59,565 --> 01:53:02,859
Just four, five, $20,000, $30,000 a month
or something, you know?

2095
01:53:04,779 --> 01:53:05,946
You okay?

2096
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:10,283
I'll put a Iittle something in an envelope.
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

2097
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:14,955
Okay. And Iisten, don't write no checks,
'cause I got a Iittle trouble with the IRS.

2098
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:17,082
Okay. Well, it'll just be cash.

2099
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:19,543
- Okay, good.
- Just be cash. That's the cleanest.

2100
01:53:19,627 --> 01:53:22,170
Yeah, yeah,
that's the way the dope boy do it.

2101
01:53:22,255 --> 01:53:24,715
- You can spend cash.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

2102
01:53:24,799 --> 01:53:29,219
I know a Iot of ways to spend them.
I'll be making it rain.

2103
01:53:29,303 --> 01:53:31,346
- Joe, a real pleasure meeting you.
- Yeah?

2104
01:53:31,431 --> 01:53:33,432
- Yeah, get your hand off me, son.
- I'm sorry.

2105
01:53:33,516 --> 01:53:35,434
I don't Iike people touching me.
Folks don't wash their hands.

2106
01:53:35,518 --> 01:53:37,477
AII right, Dad.

2107
01:53:37,562 --> 01:53:39,104
- AII right, son. Son.
- Dad.

2108
01:53:39,188 --> 01:53:40,647
- Okay.
- AII right.

2109
01:53:40,732 --> 01:53:42,691
- I Iove you now.
- I Iove you, too, Dad.

2110
01:53:42,775 --> 01:53:45,527
I Iove you.
I Iove you with the Iove of the Lord.

2111
01:53:45,611 --> 01:53:46,778
He thinks I'm his son.

2112
01:53:47,155 --> 01:53:49,656
Well, this has been a Iovely, Iovely, Iovely...

2113
01:53:50,408 --> 01:53:51,908
Been a great movie. Didn't you enjoy it?

2114
01:53:51,993 --> 01:53:53,118
Good night.
