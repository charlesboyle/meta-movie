1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Cloverfield

2
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,525
lt's 6:42 a.m.

3
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,364
Beth's Dad's place.

4
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,037
He's out of town.

5
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,002
And it's already a good day.

6
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,910
Beth.

7
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,624
— Rob, what are you doing?
— Nothing.

8
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,376
— Well, then stop.
— Nothing.

9
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,419
— That's…
— Stop it.

10
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,879
She's shy.

11
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,258
l could just see this
ending up on the lnternet.

12
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,927
Well, fine, cover up. See if l care.

13
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,055
— l'm interested in other things.
— Like what?

14
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,435
Like you.

15
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,317
— Oh, man.
— That was close.

16
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,821
Do it really… l'm scared of it.

17
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,906
— lt's only 30 minutes out.
— Shut up. l've never been.

18
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,658
You've never been to Coney lsland?

19
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,285
Oh, how have you
never been to Coney lsland?

20
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,078
l don't know, l just… l've never been.

21
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,038
Oh, that's… lt's so much fun.
l'm taking you. We're going.

22
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,373
Oh, my God.
You're so excited about this.

23
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,583
— Yeah, l can't wait to…
— Give me this.

24
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,917
What are you doing? What?

25
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,752
Oh, all right.
Well, then from the neck up, okay?

26
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,421
That's the only way l consent to this.

27
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,006
Oh, please, Rob,
nobody's paying for that online.

28
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,966
You've never been to
Twelve-Chest-Hairs.com, have you?

29
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,136
— Okay. What else?
— What else, what?

30
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,346
Other than cotton candy
and Tilt-A-Whirls?

31
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:46,309
— What do you want to do today?
— lf l answer that…

32
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,895
— All right, is this thing on?
— Look out!

33
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,021
Babe, it's not my camera.

34
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,772
l don't know if it's the on button
or the zoom button.

35
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,482
All right. Here, here, here. l think l got it.
ls this on?

36
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,193
Oh, perfect. And now we can have
a nice record of you getting run over.

37
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,820
ls that funny?

38
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,531
What time is everybody
starting to show up?

39
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,657
— lt's getting late here.
— A couple hours.

40
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,619
— That's why we have to hurry.
— Where are we going?

41
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,872
We're going… We're just going
around the corner to the store!

42
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,207
l want you to go around
with your brother's camera

43
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,168
and get testimonials from everyone.

44
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,587
Why?
l mean, it's not like this is a wedding.

45
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,840
l know it's not a wedding.
l said like a wedding.

46
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,634
l can't get this.

47
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,178
l don't get… l mean,
l don't understand why l have to do it.

48
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,555
'Cause, l mean, l don't…
l don't even know how to work this…

49
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,183
— That's what l think is gonna happen.
— No, l'm not!

50
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,517
— You totally are. You…
— You have no clue!

51
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,853
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

52
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,147
Can you see me through the viewfinder?

53
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,899
Yeah. Got you.

54
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,568
Good. Now can you see me trying
to carry these bags all by myself?

55
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,945
You're doing a great job.

56
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,405
Here, practise doing two things at once.

57
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,366
— That's good! That was good.
— Thank you.

58
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,492
l'm not lugging this thing around

59
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,618
— all night long.
— He is your brother.

60
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,827
This is important. Stop freaking out.

61
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,954
l understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!

62
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,664
— No, it isn't.
— Yes, it is! l'm not doing it!

63
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,958
Jason, l have been planning this
for two weeks!

64
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,584
— All l want you to do is help me.
— Okay, babe, babe.

65
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,545
Okay. All right? l'll do it. lt's fine.

66
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,256
l really pissed her off.

67
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,219
Babe, come on.
l was just kidding! Come on!

68
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,640
Hud? Hud, listen to me.
l got a job for you.

69
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,183
l already have got a job.

70
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,434
— l'm doing the sign, so…
— Yeah, no. l see that,

71
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,562
but this is more important than the sign.
You know how, like, at weddings,

72
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,982
people give testimonials
to the camera, right?

73
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,274
No.

74
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:21,445
All right. You're gonna take the camera
and just, you know, go around the party

75
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,322
and film people wishing Rob good luck.

76
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,448
l don't know, man.

77
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,866
— That's a lot of responsibility.
— This is important.

78
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,076
And then you have
to do it the whole night…

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,078
And Marlena's gonna be here.

80
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,204
— She is?
— Oh, yeah. She is.

81
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,539
— So you're gonna take that.
— Oh, hold on.

82
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,915
— And you're gonna talk to her…
— l didn't…

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,709
— For Rob.
— l didn't say l would do it.

84
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,918
— Just try it out.
— All right, l'll do a few.

85
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,129
You can, just do mine…

86
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,338
— Are you ready?
— Yeah, go.

87
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,798
All right.

88
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,135
Rob, l don't even know what to say, bro.

89
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,345
Best of luck in Japan.
l love you so much,

90
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,681
and l'm proud of you.

91
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,351
— That's it.
— That's it?

92
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:56,605
— Yeah. Easy enough.
— Yeah. lt's actually kind of fun.

93
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,984
— You enjoy it, Hud.
— Thanks, man.

94
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,152
Yeah, l'm doing…

95
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,696
Hey, what's up, man?

96
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,614
Hey, guys? Hey.

97
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,616
— What do we say?
— Anything.

98
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:11,120
Bon voyage, Rob.
Or however you say that in Japanese.

99
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,458
Yeah, good.
Oh, yeah, all right. Oh, yeah…

100
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,835
— Hud, what are you doing?
— l'm documenting the night.

101
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,670
But l thought l asked Jason to do that.

102
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,215
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it,
so l've been doing it.

103
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,425
l've been doing it really well.

104
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,801
Well, are you gonna
take it seriously, though?

105
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,261
Because it's really important.

106
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,638
No, of course. l've been taking it
really, really seriously.

107
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,765
— Very seriously.
— You promise?

108
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,601
Yeah, you wanna do
your testimonial now?

109
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,269
— Okay.
— Yeah, do it right now.

110
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,395
Okay.

111
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,064
Okay, just open up to him,
'cause this is gonna be

112
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,274
— the last thing he sees you…
— Okay, Hud, l got it.

113
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,109
Robert Hawkins,

114
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,404
l can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.

115
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:49,492
Oh! Easy, easy. l mean
l'm obviously standing right here…

116
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,411
And l know we're not officially family,
yet, but…

117
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,205
— Not fair, 'cause l'm gonna…
— Dude.

118
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,457
— Okay.
— l'll cut him out later.

119
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:01,587
But l think of you as my brother,
and l hope you think of me as a sister.

120
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,048
So, you better call us.

121
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,719
Now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so…

122
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,721
— Hud?
— Yeah.

123
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,556
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good.
You're good. You're good.

124
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,682
— That was good!
— That's it?

125
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:14,809
l thought that was really, really good.

126
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,894
Yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for…

127
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,074
Okay. Okay, you can do this.

128
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,329
Yeah. You got this, man. You got this.

129
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,003
— What's up, man?
— Hey, what's up, dude?

130
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,213
What's up?

131
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,137
Excuse me! Hey, Marlena?

132
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,180
— Hey, what's up?
— Hi. Hi.

133
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,932
Hey, did you know that l'm going around

134
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,601
the party and l'm…
Do you know Rob's leaving?

135
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,979
— Like it's his going-away party.
— Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:05,359
Cool. Hey, so we're taping,
l think, people talking about him.

137
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,195
Oh, no, thank you.
l barely even know Rob.

138
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,656
l'm just coming to say hi to Lily,
so it's a little weird,

139
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,199
if l'm even on it, l think, but thanks.

140
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,161
Okay, cool,
except l'm supposed to get everybody.

141
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,164
So have you ever been to a wedding?

142
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,417
No, l get what you're doing. l just…
l don't want to do it, but thank you.

143
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,879
Okay, cool.
We'll just do a short one real quick.

144
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,094
Okay.

145
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,931
Hey, Rob, Marlena.

146
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,727
l think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,

147
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,938
and every one of those times
l was really drunk,

148
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,025
so l don't really even know what to say.

149
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,985
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

150
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,321
— Like you're president of something!
— Vice president!

151
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,864
Also really cool.

152
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,034
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

153
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,454
keeping New York really safe
and fun for you when you come back.

154
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,414
— Cool, that was a really good one.
— Yeah?

155
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,166
Yeah, we can do
another one if you want.

156
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,002
Do you actually have,
like a card or something?

157
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,255
Well, my agency… We're leaving.
We're going on this stupid retreat

158
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,590
and they like all this video,

159
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,133
— like, bonding crap.
— Oh, yeah. l'm actually…

160
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,927
— l'm not a professional.
— What?

161
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,596
— l'm not a professional. l'm Hud.
— Hug?

162
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,141
No, no, no, Hud.
l'm Rob and Lily's friend.

163
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,561
— We met, like, several times before.
— Oh, yeah, yeah.

164
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,688
Yeah, you have the camera

agency's retreat if you wanted…

172
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,999
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

173
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,877

Easy, you're naive. Let's go.

00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,627
But it's very sweet. So thank you. Lily?

— Hey, man. Were you surprised?
— Yo. l was, like, not even surprised.

193
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,772
No? Can you describe your current
emotions right now?

194
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,443
l don't know. l would say blase.
Like, l'm a little… l'm just a little bored.

195
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,988
— No, you're not. Well, congrats.
— No, man, that was awesome, dude.

197
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,657

198
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,242

to Japan with you.

199
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,410
Oh, can l watch it every night

200
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,536
— when l get there?
— Jason asked if l…

201
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,746
— Yeah, you could.
— Oh, good.

00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,498
All right, thank you. Cool.

203
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,044
Hey, Hud, do you know
if Beth's coming tonight?

204
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,589
Yeah, l guess. l'm sure Lily invited her.
Why wouldn't she be here?

205
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,396
So how are you
gonna survive without Rob?

206
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,148
— He's like your main dude.
— Yeah, l know.

207
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,816
Hey, how am l gonna
survive without you?

208
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,527

209
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,158

— Hi, Hud.

210
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,369
l'm just documenting. Not here.

211
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,079
That was my biggest problem
is that she picked him…

212
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,873
You know what.
No, but when he said My Fair Lady…

213
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,876
— I love My Fair Lady.
— l was like, «Really?»

214
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,046
That was wonderful.
But, l mean, it worked out, right?

215
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,549
Beth, hey! You made it.

216
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,259
lt doesn't matter, dude, you're here.
All is well.

00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,427
Oh, no, it's good. lt's good.

219
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,600

220
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,228
Here, l'm gonna go check it out.
Look out, documenting.

221
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,437
Oh, thanks.

222
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,564

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,345
Yeah.

240
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,202
— Hey, is everything cool, man?
— Yeah, everything's cool.

241

00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,293
l don't know. Your brother gave it to me.

244
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,628
Did you switch the tape?
Because l had a tape in there.

245
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,754
l don't know. Was…

246
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,424
Roller-coasters are fun, but, like,
any kind of tea-cuppy thing…

247
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,594
Tape was in here when l got it. Why?

248
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,181
— Rob, why?
— No, it doesn't matter.

249
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,224
lt doesn't… lt's stupid.

250
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,643
Okay, are you sure you're cool?
Because you're really weirding me out.

251
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,897
Like, we haven't been
hanging out or anything.

252
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,151
— Here. Here, man. Come on.
— All right, cool. That's more like it.

253
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,737
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

254
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,032
— What's wrong with you?
— Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.

255
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,827
Hey, l'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

256
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:53,790
Oh, Hud, l don't know.
lt's not a really good time right now.

257
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,000
Come on, he's leaving.

258
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,376
— l mean, can we…
— l know.

259
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,794
You're not gonna be able
to talk to him for a while.

260
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,255
lsn't there something you wanna say?

261
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,927
You know what?
Travis, can you get me a drink?

262
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,887
— Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.

Okay, let's… Right here? l don't…

266
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,814
Okay.

267
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,276
Rob,

268
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,114
l didn't want to do this on camera.

269
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:32,621
But, l just… l just want you to know
how happy l am for you,

270
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,416
because l know how hard
you've worked for this job

271
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,253
and l know how much it means
to you and…

272
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,757
And l'm really gonna miss you.

273
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,010
Hey. Can l talk to you for a second?

274
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:57,187
Jason? There's something totally weird
going on with Rob and Beth.

275
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,398
— What are you talking about?
— l'm serious. They're right outside.

276
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,150
— Hud! Not now.
— Okay. l'll check it out.

277
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,944
You never even called me, Rob!

278
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,195
You go and bring some guy to my party?

279
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,948
Hold on!
You haven't talked to me in weeks!

280
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,783
— Hud, man! Come on!
— Sorry!

281
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,160
— What? What?
— l got it. l got it. Hud, get back inside.

282
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,122
— But l'm documenting!
— Not this.

283
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,916
Lily, do you know what
they were fighting about?

284
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,835
Lily, if you know,
you have to tell me. Lily!

285
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,044
l'm not telling you.

286
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,755
l really should know,
as the guy documenting this.

287
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,923
She was the one
who brought me back inside.

288
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,009
— Okay, fine. We'll go find out.
— l'm positive. l promise.

289
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,969
— We'll ask her. We'll go find out.
— She's in the kitchen.

290
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,013
— What?
— Lil!

291
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,390
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

292
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,558
— No.
— You do, don't you?

293
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,726
— What? No.
— Hud, you're a genius.

294
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,978
— You're dodging the question right now.
— There is nothing to tell you.

295
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,104
— Nothing.
— Liar.

296
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,814
Lily, if you know something,
you have to tell us.

297
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,940
— No.
— Look at me.

298
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,192
— Lily.
— l know you. Babe.

299
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,487
Okay, fine, but not on camera.
l'm not telling you on camera.

300
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,864
Okay, that's not a problem.
All right, no problem.

301
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,490
Why would we say anything?

302
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,075
— We won't say anything.
— Rob and Beth slept together.

303
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,827
— Are you serious?
— lt happened a few weeks ago.

304
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,412
Beth made me promise
not to say anything.

305
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,580
Are you kidding me, Lily?

306
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,248
Rob and Beth sleep together,
you're not gonna tell me?

307
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,668
— Why wouldn't you tell me?
— Why wouldn't l tell you?

308
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,795
Okay, you guys,
don't ask me where l heard this.

309
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,548
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

310
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,425
— l knew it.
— Are you kidding me?

311
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,552
No, l'm not kidding.
This is extremely serious.

312
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,262
Hey, Marlena.

313
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,722
— lt's me, Hud, from before.
— Hi. Right.

314
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,433
Did you know
that Rob and Beth had sex?

315
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,101
— No.
— Yeah, isn't that crazy?

316
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,269
— They've been friends forever.
— Crazy.

317
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,438
l mean, Rob's been in love
with her since college.

318
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,025
Well, maybe it was like
a going-away present, you know?

319
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,070
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed
to get presents?

320
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,821
— They did. They had sexual intercourse.
— What?

321
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,031
— Lily told me.
— No way.

322
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,199
— No, you are so…
— No, l promise.

323
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,367
Why do you make up stuff like that?

324
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,701
— No, l do not. l have a nice car.
— You make shit up.

325
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,703
l didn't say what kind…

326
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,954
Hey.

327
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,258
— Good luck in Japan, Rob.
— Good luck tonight, Travis.

328
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,264
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Are you all right, man?

329
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,141
— Hey. Come on.
— This is not the time, Hud.

330
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,476
— What is it, man?
— Let him go.

331
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,395
— We should talk to him.
— We're not talking to him.

332
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,688
l could talk to him now.

333
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,398
Dude, you already talked
to the whole party!

334
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,858
— … have to do something.
— No. Everyone needs to just calm down

335
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,068
— and give him space.
— He's just gonna stay

336
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,861
— locked in his room all night?
— Lily, look at you.

337
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,655
— lt's fine, trust me.
— lt is not fine.

338
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,365
— lt is fine.
— You are his brother.

339
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,785
You are his best friend.
Go and make him happy.

340
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,454
So, how do you wanna do this?
Do you wanna do most of the talking,

341
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,997
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?

342
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,041
— You're not doing any talking.
— Okay, cool.

343
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,209
We got to talk.

344
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,335
You don't know
what you're talking about,

345
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,587
— all right?
— Okay, well, then tell me.

346
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,923
lt was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

347
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,259
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori
that after you guys got together,

348
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,760
— you totally blew her off.
— l didn't blow her off!

349
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:34,928
She said you never called her.

350
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,431
Look, l'm leaving, all right?
So what am l supposed to do?

351
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,099
l don't know, man.
She was heartbroken.

352
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,602
Look, there's no «together.» lt's just
her and me, two separate things.

353
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,812
lt's better if we just stay friends.

354
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,605
… not that l feel like l'm not
good enough for her!

355
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,607
No, stop, stop!
l didn't say «feel,» Rob.

356
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,317
You're not good enough for her.

357
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,279
That's it. That's fact. That's science.

358
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,991
Beth Mclntyre is, like,
from a whole 'nother planet, man.

359
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,120
She's beautiful. She's charming.
And you… l love you,

360
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,456
but let's face it,
you're kind of a douchebag.

361
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,210
And going to Japan is not gonna fix that.
She's crazy about you, bro.

362
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,505
— Like, right now, as you are.
— And you're in love with her.

363
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,299
— But you got to go after her.
— lt's not that simple.

364
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,634
— No, it is that simple, Rob.
— Come on, man. Don't be scared.

365
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,887
lt's about moments, man.
That's all that…

366
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,264
You got to learn to say,
«Forget the world,»

367
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,892
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.

368
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,980
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?

369
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,736
That scared the shit out of me.

370
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,405
Lil! Lil!

371
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,282
Did you feel that?
lt was like an earthquake.

372
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,450
— You guys…
— Lil, where are you?

373
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,285
— What was that?
— What was that?

374
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,870
— Hey. Are you all right?
— Oh, my God.

375
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,288
— Yeah, that was really scary.
— Did you see anything?

376
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,082
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?

377
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,334
Guys, look out!

378
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,461
— Okay.
— lt was like a bomb.

379
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,630
All right, here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

380
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,799
Wait. Everyone quiet down. All right?

381
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,050
— But now, just approximately…
— Shut up, shut up.

382
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,636
— … 1 5 minutes after word…
— Guys! Come on.

383
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,096
… of a possible earthquake
in Iower Manhattan.

384
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,477
Nearby, in New York Harbour, we're
getting word of an oil tanker capsizing

385
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,064
in the middIe of the harbour
near the Statue of Liberty.

386
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,607
— Once again…
— Dude, that's really close.

387
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,859
— … there's no way to know if any…
— That's really, really close.

388
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,861
That's true. Do you think
we could see something from the roof?

389
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,447
— l don't know. Maybe.
— J, wanna go to the roof?

390
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,698
Let's go see if we can see
something on the roof.

391
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,991
Come on, Jason.
We're not going up to the roof.

392
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,203
— Yeah, let's go up there.
— l don't think we should.

393
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,539
— No!
— That was really…

394
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,334
What do you think?
Think it's another terrorist attack?

395
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,379
— lt's insane, man.
— Watch your step.

396
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,348
lt was shaking everywhere, man.
Just like tremors.

397
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,059
— Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
— ls this the only lights that went out?

398
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,727
— l think they blew up the trains.
— No, a couple did.

399
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:52,148
— Some stayed on.
— Oh, man. What is going on?

400
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,317
Maybe you should've left town
a little bit earlier, right?

401
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,735
Shut up.

402
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,572
Oh, my God!

403
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,908
No, no, no.

404
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,911
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

405
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,500
Hud. Move. Hud!

406
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,851
Oh, God.

407
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,314
— Rob, you got a set of keys?
— Get out of here!

408
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,941
Right, did you look back?
Did anybody get hurt?

409
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,736
— Did anybody see Jason or not?
— l don't know.

410
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,864
Did anybody see Jason?
Has anybody seen Jason?

411
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,783
— Did anybody see Jason?
— ls he inside?

412
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,166
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!

413
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,209
Oh, Jesus Christ!

414
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,631
— Oh, God! Oh, God!
— Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

415
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,343
Oh, my God!

416
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,731
You gotta take your stuff
and we gotta get out of here, man!

417
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,024
l'm telling you!

418
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,984
— l'm so sorry.
— Where were you?

419
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,496
Hey, did you guys see that?
Did you guys just see that?

420
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,594
Go! Let's go!

421
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,477
— Hey, get down! Get down!
— You all right? You all right?

422
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,062
Yeah, did you guys see that?

423
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,565
— Did you guys see that?
— You all right?

424
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,405
There are people still out there.

425
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,376
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob, l saw it! Rob!

426
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,129
— Rob.
— What?

427
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,296
— Rob, l saw it!
— What?

428
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,465
— What's he saying?
— lt's alive.

429
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,603
Stay down, Lily! Get back!

430
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,571
He's going away now.

431
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,032
— Jason, what are you doing?
— Jason, where are you going?

432
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,783
Lily, just wait.

433
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,120
— Jason, don't go out…
— Jason, don't!

434
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,538
Lily, just wait here!

435
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,707
Hey, Rob! Rob!
Where's he going, dude?

436
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,752
— Jason!
— Rob. Rob!

437
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,525
— Oh, my God. Marlena?
— Oh, God.

438
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,029
Are you okay?
Wait, come here. Come here. Sit down.

439
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,260
lt walked right through
that street over there.

440
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,888
That's what l'm trying to tell you.
lt walked right over my head.

441
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,058
— What?
— That's the sound it's making.

442
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,352
You said you saw something, right?
So what did you see?

443
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,729
— You said it was alive? What was it?
— Who cares what it…

444
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,525
l don't know, man. l don't know.
l mean, l was taping. l can show you.

445
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,652
Hey, you guys! l have it on tape!

446
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,905
— Well, then rewind it. Rewind it.
— Yeah. Here, here. Let me rewind it…

447
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,323
lt's gonna be a great opportunity for you.

448
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,950
Yeah, but l don't even
speak the language.

449
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,451
Oh, come on. How hard could it be?

450
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,412
lt's Japanese. lt's Japanese-hard.

451
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,376
— lt'll be fine.
— Do you really think l should go?

452
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,378
— Oh, my God.
— That makes no sense.

453
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,131
— That makes no sense.
— Did you see it?

454
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,341
l don't know what it was, of course!
lt was giant.

455
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,844
lt was like… Did you see that thing?

456
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,971
— l'm not yelling at you, all right?
— Yes, you are!

457
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,973
Hey, guys, guys, come on!
Everybody just calm down!

458
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,517
— Quiet, guys.
— All right. Come on, just shut up!

459
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,311
All right? We don't know what we saw!
The point is it's still here!

460
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,689
All right? So we need to get
the hell out of Manhattan!

461
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,440
— Now.
— Yeah, yeah.

462
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,234
And out to the Brooklyn Bridge.
l think it's the best plan.

463
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,278
— lt's a straight shot to Delancey.
— Just take the Williamsburg.

464
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,363
No. Do you know how far that is?
Brooklyn is right there.

465
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,949
No, no, no, dude. lt's so much closer.
lt's right here.

466
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,034
— Centre Street's like a block away.
— What's going on?

467
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,704
l think we're gonna get out of here.
ls she okay to…

468
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,498
Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay. Marlena,
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

469
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,543
lt was eating people.
lt was eating everyone.

470
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,380
We gotta go! Go! Let's go!

471
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,756
Okay, come here.

472
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,593
— Go, go, go, go, go.
— l don't think… Don't even look.

473
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,391
— ls anyone's phone working?
— What?

474
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,934
— Hud, is your phone working?
— What?

475
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,604
— No…
— Shit! l left it in the apartment.

476
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,230
— There's no signal.
— You're not getting a signal either?

477
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,648
No, no, come on.

478
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,483
— Hud, come on!
— What? Okay.

479
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,287
lt's all right.

480
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,705
Let's go.

481
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,831
We need an lV.

482
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,041
— Calm down, please.
— Let's go, people.

00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,417
— Let's go. Let's go.
— Excuse me, Officer.

484
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,085
Do you know…
What was that thing? What was it?

485
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,754
Look, if you're not injured,
you got to keep moving, man.

486
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,715
Let's go! Let's go, people! Let's go!

487
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,176
Yeah, once we get to the bridge,
we'll be safe.

488
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,179
Hey, how are you? ls she doing better?

489
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,014
She's okay. She's gonna be fine.

490
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,351
— Marlena, you saw it. What was that?
— Not now, Hud.

491
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,646
Sorry.

492
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,277
Please go in an orderly manner.

493
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:14,155
Continue moving south
towards Brooklyn.

494
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,908
— Just keep going.
— Yeah, l don't know. lt got hit.

495
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:21,037
Once we get over there,
l'll go to my cousin's house.

496
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,830
She has a condo. She's out of town.

497
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:31,172
l repeat, do not stop. Keep moving.

498
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,509
There wiII be instructions
on the Brooklyn side…

499
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:40,682
Get across the bridge.
Move in a quick and orderly fashion.

500
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,443
— You still filming?
— Yeah.

501
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,697
People are gonna wanna know
how it all went down.

502
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,449
Well, you can just tell them
how it all went down, Hud.

503
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,076
No, that wouldn't work.

504
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,663
People need to see this, you know?
This is gonna be important.

505
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,331
l mean, people are gonna watch this.

506
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,417
— Beth? Beth?
— Rob!

507
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,380
Beth, l've been trying to reach you.
Are you okay? Hello?

508
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:16,551
Wait a second, you guys!
Look, hey! Lily, stop!

509
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,762

Can you speak up?

510
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,055
Lily!

511
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,559
— What?
— Rob got a hold of Beth.

512
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,561
Wait! Jason, wait!

513
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,730
— Rob's got Beth on the phone!
— What'd you say?

514
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,898

— Hey, y'all, come on.

515
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,608
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

516
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:35,528
Okay, Beth, you're gonna
have to calm down, okay?

517
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,906
Where are you?
What do you mean, you can't move?

518
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,784
— What?
— l repeat, no panicking.

519
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,250
Did you see it?

520
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,102
— Jason!
— Can you see anything?

521
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,645
No, l can't get over there!

522
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,939
l can't… l can't see anything!
Can you see it?

523
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,733
Jason!

524
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,902
— Why did you stop?
— Jason!

525
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,987
— What?
— Jason, watch out!

526
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,955
Jason! No, Jason! No!

527
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,377
Jason!

528
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,341
— No, no! God! No, Jason! Jason!
— Lily, come on!

529
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,967
Jason! No!

530
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,695
Go, go, go, go!

531
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:31,352
Lily. Lily, wait. Stop! Turn around
and listen to me right now.

532
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,479
Would somebody please,
please tell me what just happened?

533
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,357
— l don't know.
— l mean, it came out of nowhere!

534
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,067
And he was there
and then he was gone!

535
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,779
— My God! Jason! Jason!
— Lily, l'm so, so sorry.

536
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:45,199
Rob. You got to listen to me, man.
l am so sorry about your brother.

537
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:49,745
l'm sorry, man. l'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Rob?

538
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,251
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

539
00:29:57,588 --> 00:30:00,548
— Rob. Rob, dude.
— We can't stay here.

540
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,926
— We can't.
— Rob. We got to get out of here, man.

541
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,221
Listen to me.
We got… We got to get moving, man.

542
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,848
We go to the Manhattan Bridge,
you know?

543
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,641
We got to get out of here.
lt's not safe here.

544
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,186
Okay, we can go to the other side.
We can try and get

545
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,397
to the Lincoln Tunnel.
l don't know, man. l don't know, but…

546
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,984
Dude, we got to get out of here.
lt's not safe here.

547
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:24,238
What are we gonna do, Rob?
What are we gonna do?

548
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,825
Do you know? Hey!

549
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,079
Look… Hey, Jesus. Rob. Hey, Rob?

550
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,081
— No.
— Rob!

551
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,167
— My battery's dead.
— Yeah, dude, l…

552
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,045
Well, listen, we got
to get out of here, man. You know?

553
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,338
— Rob! Rob!
— Well, where's he going?

554
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,923
Where are you going?

555
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,675
Oh, God. l'll go get him. Hey, Rob!

556
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:50,932
Rob! Dude!
l can't take all this running, man!

557
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,935
Hey, Rob.

558
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,396
Excuse me. Hey, Rob!
The store's closed, man!

559
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,732
— Rob, Rob!
— … burning right now.

560
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,778
The bridge was filled
with pedestrians travelling across.

561
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,112
— lt has collapsed.
— Holy shit.

562
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,198
No word on injuries yet, but…

563
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,618
Oh, God.

564
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,582
We continue now with our breaking
news story in lower Manhattan.

565
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,503
We are getting some truly extraordinary
live images here in the studio.

566
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,796
For those of you justjoining us,

567
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,507
Iower Manhattan is
in an absolute state of siege

568
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,217
in what has been…

569
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,767
This is a mandatory evacuation.

570
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,270
Proceed south immediately.

571
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,648
Get out of the city in an orderly fashion.

572
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:45,570
This is a mandatory evacuation!
We need everyone out of this area now!

573
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,988
Rob? Rob! Hey, dude!

574
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,198
Actually, l think we need to get out
of here, like, right now!

575
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,491
Do you know what l'm saying?
Because there's some

576
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,995
serious shit going on outside! Rob?
No, like, you know what l mean?

577
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,998
Rob, like, there's some strange
shit going on! Rob?

578
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,625
Donna MarteI is near the scene
at City HaII.

579
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,918
What's going on?

580
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,962
Can you teII us what it Iooks Iike
on the ground there?

581
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,299
Well, Bob, the military will not
let us get too close,

582
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,844
but from what we can see,
there's clearly a sizable mobilisation

583
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,178
of troops and equipment,

584
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,180
and they're trying to get everyone
to Ieave the area…

585
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,349
To be honest, Tom, your guess
is as good as mine at this point.

586
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,727
There appears to be
something coming off of it.

587
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,021
And the ground seems
to be covered in debris…

588
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,731
lt looks like there's something
falling of it, doesn't it?

589
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,566
Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.

590
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,943
There are pieces falling
aII over the street.

591
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,820
— Oh, my God.
— Whatever they are, they are moving.

592
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,946
— Oh, my God! They're…
— Donna!

593
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,156
— They're right there!
— Oh, shit.

594
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,158
— Donna, can you hear us?
— Hey!

595
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,327
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here! Where is he?

596
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,494
l know, that's what l've been telling him.

597
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,704
— Rob! Rob!
— l've been trying to do that!

598
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,539
Rob. Rob. We gotta go right now, okay?

599
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,375
— The military's evacuating everyone.
— Hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?

600
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,585
We gotta get out of here.

601
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,087
— lt's time to leave the electronics store.
— Rob, come on. We got to go.

602
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,464
— Just come on. Let's go…
— Just stop it!

603
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,090
Okay? Stop, wait!

604
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,218
To listen to your messages…

605
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:59,352
Rob! Rob! I can't…
Oh, God! l can't move.

606
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:04,690
lt fell. My apartment…
The whoIe waII feII on me!

607
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,071
l'm bleeding! l'm bleeding. l can't move.

608
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,156
Oh, my God.

609
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,662
Help me, Rob.

610
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,122
To delete this message…

611
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,221
Rob, wait up! Rob!

612
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,848
l got your message,
and l'm on my way there, okay?

613
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,434
Hey, Rob, listen.
You got to think this through, man.

614
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,896
Okay? Beth lives in Midtown.
Midtown is that way.

615
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,231
— Guess what else is that way?
— Will you wait up?

616
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,692
— Some horrific shit is in Midtown!
— This is insane, okay?

617
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,652
We're not gonna go
near that thing, okay?

618
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,529
We're not gonna go
to the middle of the city!

619
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,280
No, we're not.
You're not coming with me.

620
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,157
Look. Fall in with the military.
Fall in with the crowd.

621
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,617
Let them gonna escort you out of here.

622
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:57,785
Okay?

623
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,121
— Rob!
— l'm sorry. l got to go.

624
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,747
Rob!

625
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,958
— Rob! Listen!
— Rob, wait a minute!

626
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,668
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

627
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,295
and that's gonna be very uncomfortable
for everybody involved!

628
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,755
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?

629
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,384
Look at me. This is not me crazy.
All right? l know what l'm doing.

630
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,510
And you can't talk me out of it.

631
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,138
— So turn around, go…
— l'm coming.

632
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,640
l'm coming with you.

633
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,767
Lily, you don't have to do that.

634
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,979
— No, l want to. l'm coming.
— Guys, did you not hear her message?

635
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,814
l mean, even if we get to Beth's,
there's a chance

636
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,774
— that she's already…
— Shut up.

637
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,989
Guys, this is insane.

638
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,658
— Rob!
— You know what l'm talking about, right?

639
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,993
You can't possibly think
that this is a good idea.

640
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,202
Rob! Rob!

641
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,288
— Rob!
— Hey… Hold…

642
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,917
l'm sorry, l don't understand you.

643
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,879
Yeah, but l don't understand you.
Rob, hold up!

644
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,006
Look, l'm sorry. Hey, listen to me. Man.

645
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,632
— Hud!
— l'm so sorry.

646
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,259
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!

647
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,344
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 91 1 ,

648
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,180
— see if somebody else can get there?
— Yeah, l tried!

649
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,599
Okay, well. l mean, what about police?
Fire department?

650
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,810
— l couldn't get through! l tried, l…
— Okay, it just seems a little…

651
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,231
— Oh, shit.
— Oh, my God!

652
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,679
Oh! Oh, my God.

653
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,478
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

654
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,192
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob!

655
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,036
— Hud! We're gonna go this way!
— l can't hear you!

656
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,914
— Subway!
— What? What?

657
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,834
— Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
— Come on! Come on!

658
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,211
This shit is crazy, dude!

659
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,388
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like…

660
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,478
Hud! Hud!

661
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,522
Are you okay, man? You all right?

662
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,983
— Yeah. Yeah, l'm all right.
— Come on.

663
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,570
— Okay. Okay. Oh, God damn.
— Oh, shit.

664
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,453
What the hell was that?

665
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:52,167
— Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
— Did you see that?

666
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:55,004
— Oh, my God. Oh, God.
— Did you see that?

667
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,732
Okay.

668
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,779
Hey, look. We can just cross…
We can just cross to the other platform,

669
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,865
then go up the stairs and see
if the other side of the street…

670
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,159
Rob, the other side of the street
looks the same as this side!

671
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,202
We can wait for there to be a lull,
and then make a break for it!

672
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,204
Rob, the air caught on fire! Okay?
There's not gonna be a lull!

673
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,581
But if we wait on the other…

674
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,417
Listen to me, man,
l am with you, okay? l really, really am.

675
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,004
l'm just saying, you gotta listen
to what's going on up there.

676
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,007
— We can't…
— Rob, he's right, okay?

677
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,509
We have to wait. We have to wait.

678
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,014
This is insane.

679
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,187
Shit!

680
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:15,125
— Oh, God.
— What? Rob, what?

681
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,755
Hey, Mom.

682
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,927
Yeah, no. l'm okay. Okay, yeah, we are.

683
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,763
We're being evacuated right now.
The army's here.

684
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,976
We're being evacuated, so don't worry.
Okay, but Mom… Mom, listen.

685
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:39,024
We tried to get out of the city,
and we took the Brooklyn Bridge,

686
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,319
and we were right there when it hit.

687
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:48,075
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, Mom.

688
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,593
l don't know what to say to him.

689
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,388
You know?

690
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,435
Like, l feel like l should say something,

691
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,772
but l don't know what to say.

692
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,501
l'm not even supposed to be here.

693
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,714
You didn't have to be. l mean,

694
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,802
you had your chance in the alley.

695
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,179
You could've left us.

696
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:39,394
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?

697
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,814
Yeah.

698
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,109
l'm sorry.

699
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,155
— This isn't a bad idea.
— Just walk.

700
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,533
— Wait, so then…
— What's going on?

701
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,076
l don't know.

702
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,584
— … just go across here.
— That's good.

703
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,586
Yeah. This is the six.

704
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,338
Rob, l don't think the trains
are running right now, man.

705
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,507
— No, we can just walk the track, see?
— Yeah.

706
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,092
Look. Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.

707
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,845
We can just walk down the six
to Lexington and then walk down

708
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,931
— Central Park South.
— You want us to walk in the tunnels?

709
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,267
lt's either that or stay here.

710
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,187
l'll walk the tunnels.

711
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,574
l can't see.

712
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,952
— lt's kind of freaking me out, you know?
— l think there's a light on the camera.

713
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,579
— Let me see.
— There is?

714
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,039
Yeah, right here. See?

715
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,462
Okay.

716
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,144
Ocean is big, dude.

717
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,021
All l'm saying is a couple of years ago,

718
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,148
they found a fish in Madagascar
that they thought

719
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,233
— had been extinct for centuries.
— So what?

720
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,235
lt's been down there this whole time,
and nobody noticed?

721
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,405
Sure. Maybe it erupted
from an ocean trench, you know?

722
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,950
Or a crevasse. Crevice.
lt's just a theory.

723
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,037
l mean, for all we know,
it's from another planet and it flew here.

724
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,748
— Like Superman?
— Yeah, exactly like…

725
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,000
Wait. You know who Superman is?

726
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,712
Oh, my God.
You know who Superman is?

727
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,423
— Okay, l'm not…
— l'm, like, feeling something.

728
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,508
— Are you aware of Garfield?
— A lot of people think

729
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,177
he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.

730
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,638
l just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing l said to her was,

731
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,848
«Good luck tonight, Travis.»

732
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,685
She knows you didn't mean that.

733
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,649
When l think of some of the things
l said to Jason…

734
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,901
— No, that's different.
— Why?

735
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,030
Jason knew you loved him.

736
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,962
Hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago, when that guy

737
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,172
was lighting homeless people
on fire in the subways?

738
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,757
— Jesus, Hud.
— What?

739
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,635
lt's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.

740
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,886
Right.

741
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,726
l just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy

742
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,019
— came out of the dark right now.
— Hud, seriously.

743
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,188
— Seriously.
— l'm just saying. Sorry.

744
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:35,237
— What was that?
— Let's just keep moving.

745
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,491
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

746
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,580
This is disgusting.

747
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,499
They're all running
in the same direction.

748
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,460
— Yeah, like they're running away.
— From what?

749
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,053
Hey, how much farther?

750
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,972
l don't know.
Let's get out at the next station.

751
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,473
— Okay?
— Yeah.

752
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,601
Did you guys hear that?

753
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,604
— What is that?
— Just listen.

754
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:14,318
l don't see anything. Do you guys?

755
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,490
— Oh, man, this is the worst.
— Will you be quiet for five seconds?

756
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,909
— Oh, turn on the night vision.
— What?

757
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,328
— What do you mean?
— lt's right here.

758
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,080
l got it. lt's right here. There.

759
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,501
ls it on?

760
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,004
— Oh, shit.
— What? What?

761
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,173
— Run. Okay, run. Okay, run.
— What?

762
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,842
Hey, let's start running! Just run!
Just run! Just start running right now!

763
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:43,430
Start running now! Run, run, run! Run!
Just run!

764
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,349
— Lily!
— You guys!

765
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,354
Wait.

766
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,444
Oh, God! Help!
Please help! You guys, help!

767
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,625
Marlena! Here!

768
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,629
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

769
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,425
Hud!

770
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,728
— … there you go.
— Totally not what l was thinking…

771
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,745
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

772
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,330
You okay?

773
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,417
You tell me.

774
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,920
How does it look?

775
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,673
Looks like it hurts.

776
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,093
What do you mean? You're saying
this isn't attractive, like, at all?

777
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,177
A little bit.

778
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:16,189
— Here. Here, here. You can wash it off.
— Thanks.

779
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:19,443
Here. Did it get you, Hud?
Did it bite you, man?

780
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,194
No, it didn't get me.

781
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,613
Okay. Okay.

782
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,453
Hey. Hey.

783
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,122
So those things
came out of nowhere, right?

784
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,166
— Yeah.
— Oh, man.

785
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,712
That one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.

786
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,297
What's up with that?

787
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,552
— Maybe it liked you, Hud.
— Yeah.

788
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,847
Maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.

789
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:58,815
Hey, thanks for coming back
and helping me out, you know?

790
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,737
What? You think that l'm the kind
of person that wouldn't do that?

791
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:07,407
No. No. l know you aren't.

792
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:12,704
l was just saying, like, l'm glad you did.

793
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,878
Otherwise,
l would have been totally dead.

794
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,005
Right?

795
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,716
lt's okay. You just got bit.

796
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,177
Hey.

797
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:31,556
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?

798
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,934
Well, we could wait here
for a little bit, l guess,

799
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,102
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.

800
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:38,104
— Yeah, okay. What's the next option?
— Well.

801
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,941
Okay, we could see
what's out through this way.

802
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:44,110
— Maybe find another tunnel.
— No, no more tunnels.

803
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:48,198
Then, l don't know.
We try our luck up top.

804
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:52,869
Okay, just to be clear,
so our options are

805
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:57,541
die here, die in the tunnels,
or die in the streets. ls that…

806
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,793
— Yeah, pretty much.
— … pretty much the summing up of it?

807
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,378
But wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?

808
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:05,632
So, let's just go up and look around.
See if we recognise anything.

809
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,135
Do you think you'll be okay to walk?

810
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:10,720
— No, l'm fine. l'm fine.
— Here, l'll help you.

811
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:34,744
— We're at 59th.
— We're at 59th.

812
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,580
— Yeah.
— We're at 59th.

813
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,011
That's weird.

814
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,139
What?

815
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,312
Yeah.

816
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,870
Hello!

817
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,596
Marlena?

818
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,057
— What's wrong?
— Are you okay?

819
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,268
l'm really… l'm dizzy.

820
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,104
Yeah. Do you wanna
sit down for a second?

821
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,318
— No, l'm fine.
— She needs a doctor.

822
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,486
— You sure?
— l'm totally fine.

823
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,987
You know, 'cause we could
sit down if you want to.

824
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,113
No, l'm fine, l'm fine.

825
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,699
We've got civilians!
Are there any more of you?

826
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,117
— No, just us four.
— lt's just us.

827
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,744
We got four civilians here.

828
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,163
— Okay, bring them in.
— Roger.

829
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,540
— Let's go, move. Move it.
— Okay, okay.

830
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,878
— Let's go!
— Okay, okay.

831
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,634
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.

832
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,261
Listen, we need your help.
Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped

833
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:16,888
in her building right by here,
at Columbus Circle.

834
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,348
That is not
where you wanna be right now.

835
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,850
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

836
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:24,396
lf they know, they ain't telling me.
Whatever it is, it's winning.

837
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,281
— What's up?
— We got another bite here.

838
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,159
Don't look at that. Gross.

839
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,914
— Please, we can't stay here. We have…
— Hey, not now.

840
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,457
— Copy that.
— Sir, we have two F-1 8s

841
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,167
on route from Selfridge.
Four more are arming up,

842
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,753
— maybe 30 minutes out.
— Roger that.

843
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:51,798
Listen up, people.
Rack them and pack them.

844
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,050
— We're phantoms in 1 5.
— Sir.

845
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,052
— Where the hell did you find them?
— They were in the tunnels.

846
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,179
Yeah, we had to walk all the way
from Spring Street.

847
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,598
Get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.

848
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,726
— Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move.
— No, wait. Wait.

849
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,060
— Listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
— Move it.

850
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,186
— Move. Move.
— We have to get to her.

851
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,563
Sorry, son, can't help you.
Get them on the chopper.

852
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,149
No, but, please, listen to me. Let go!
Just listen for a second, please!

853
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:10,817
Turn that goddamned camera…

854
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:15,321
— We've been trying to get to her all…
— Make our own way.

855
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,991
— No, do you have a…
— l am not jeopardising this operation,

856
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,409
— or my men.
— l don't want your help.

857
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,952
You are getting on that chopper now.

858
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,412
l just need you to listen to me
for one second, sir.

859
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,622
— You have no idea what's out there.
— l don't care what's out there.

860
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,749
Listen to me. She's dying.

861
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,958
There is nothing l can do
about that now.

862
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,461
The girl that l love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.

863
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,255
She should have been with me tonight,
and l let her go and…

864
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,299
And l get it, okay?
You have your hands full. l get that.

865
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,260
l get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me,

866
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,721
— then you're gonna have to shoot me.
— Hud.

867
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,308
— l don't feel so good.
— Oh, shit.

868
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,352
— Bite! We've got a bite!
— Marlena.

869
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:47,604
— Hold on a second.
— Get her moving.

870
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:48,772
Keep moving!

871
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,982
Hey, Marlena, are you okay?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

872
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,984
Hold on a second.
Where are you taking her?

873
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,819
Hold on a second. Wait!
Oh my God, wait!

874
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:56,946
— Marlena, stop! Just wait a second!
— Let me go.

875
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,323
— Just wait a second. Please.
— Let me go.

876
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,949
— Wait! Marlena!
— Get out of the way.

877
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,785
Marlena! Hold on a second!

878
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,204
— Just wait a… Let go of me! Stop it!
— No.

879
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,419
God! Please, God!
Where are you taking Marlena?

880
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,754
Wait a second.

881
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,263
lt's over. There is nothing you can do.

882
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:26,518
There is nothing you can do
for her now. lt is over. lt's over.

883
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:30,063
— Rogers, clear out of here.
— You sure?

884
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,190
l'll get them to the choppers from here.

885
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,859
— Let's move out.
— Oh, my God.

886
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,737
What just happened?

887
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,158
Let's go. l shouldn't be doing this shit.

888
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:45,328
— Come on. Come on.
— Okay.

889
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,497
— Let's go. Move.
— Okay, okay.

890
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,040
Let's go, move. Come on.

891
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,088
You gotta listen to me.

892
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,341
This girl, her building,
it's at Columbus Circle?

893
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,261
— Yeah?
— lf you wanna go out in this,

894
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,638
l ain't gonna stop you.
But you gotta know something.

895
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,057
The government's considering
the Hammer Down protocol,

896
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,017
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.

897
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,728
— You mean Midtown?
— No, l mean Manhattan.

898
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:13,815
Come on. We're taking
one last shot at this thing.

899
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:14,941
— Oh, God.
— lf that doesn't work,

900
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,777
they're levelling
the whole goddamned city.

901
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:20,029
— Your watch is still working?
— Yeah?

902
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,740
All right. The airlifts are leaving
from 40th and Park.

903
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,577
Last chopper's wheels-up
at exactly 0600.

904
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,413
lf you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.

905
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:31,207
— Okay. Okay, thank you.
— 58th Street's right there.

906
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,084
— Now, go. Move, move, move.
— Let's go.

907
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,294
— Let's go.
— Go, go, go.

908
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,757
— This is like a nightmare, you know.
— lt all happened so fast,

909
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,801
l couldn't even really see
what happened to her.

910
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,846
l mean, did you see it?
Could you see what happened, Hud?

911
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,765
No, her eyes started bleeding, and then
they were screaming she was bitten.

912
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,184
And then she wouldn't stop bleeding.
And then…

913
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,814
Hud.

914
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:01,362
— You okay?
— Yeah, l'm okay. l'm okay.

915
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,911
Look, guys, l don't mean to be…
But we don't have a lot of time.

916
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:11,039
Okay, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and l'll go.

917
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,457
All right?

918
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:17,128
— l'm sorry. l just…
— No, no, we're coming. We're coming.

919
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,379
Are you sure?

920
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,049
No, no, man.
No, we have to do this, okay?

921
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,635
We're with you. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go right now.

922
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,442
— Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
— What?

923
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,986
— Oh, my God.
— What is it? What?

924
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,823
— Shit.
— That's not Beth's place, is it?

925
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,867
— Oh, my God.
— ls that Beth's apartment?

926
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:51,371
— Oh, my God.
— Rob. ls that her place?

927
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,707
— Tell me that's not her place.
— That's her place, yeah.

928
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,754
Oh, shit. l don't suppose
she lives on the ground floor.

929
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,005
No, 39th.

930
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,799
— Oh, great.
— How do we even get up there?

931
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:06,886
l don't know. We just go inside
and then see how high we can get.

932
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,807
l don't know if l can do that.

933
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,893
Well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,

934
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,729
and then see if there's a place
to cross over onto her roof.

935
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:20,024
And then we could find some way
down to her place.

936
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,528
Wait. No, never mind.
No, that's a bad idea.

937
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,154
Hey, that's a bad idea. l take that back.

938
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:30,827
No one ever listens to me, ever.
And now, of course, they listen to me.

939
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,036
Great.

940
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:36,541
Shit. Shit.

941
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,710
Probably not working.

942
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,169
— What's going on?
— Not working.

943
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,588
Wait, wait. Let's just… Maybe…

944
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,675
— No? No?
— Shit.

945
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,386
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

946
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,683
You guys see that guy's face
when Lily asked him what it was?

947
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,935
l mean, they have no idea.

948
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,858
— Unless they're, like, in on it.
— Jesus, Hud.

949
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,317
l don't read the papers.

950
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,069
— Maybe our government made this thing.
— Oh, yeah.

951
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,863
l mean, you know,
maybe it was an accident,

952
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,281
— or maybe it was on purpose…
— Sure, maybe they did.

953
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,241
— Does it really matter right now?
— Yeah.

954
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,162
lt matters because l need to talk
about something.

955
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,957
Otherwise, l'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

956
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,838
l'm sorry.

957
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,093
Hey, wait, wait. You guys hear that?
You guys hear that?

958
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,846
— Yes.
— Yeah.

959
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,348
Yeah, l think we're getting close.

960
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,769
Hud, l'm gonna check this floor.

961
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:38,978
Okay.

962
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,072
Okay, like, l think it's like,
two more up, l think.

963
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,198
Okay.

964
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,658
Guys, guys, guys.

965
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,870
This one, it's got to be.
lt's got to be this one.

966
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,012
Oh, God.

967
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,522
l don't think there's anybody here. No.

968
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,401
— Oh, Jesus.
— Oh, my God.

969
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:32,865
— Oh, my God.
— Okay.

970
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,909
Okay, now, we can do this.

01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:33,395
— They're all gone.
— l know.

1132
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:43,947
We gotta go. We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

1133
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:47,117
Where? There's nowhere to go to.

1134
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,453
We got to go. He's coming towards us.

1135
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:52,581
No, we should just wait here.
Just wait here.

1136
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,375
Listen, we wait here,
they'll find us, all right?

1137
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,170
They're fighting him right now.
lf we wait here, they'll find us.

1138
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,339
No, we can't stay.

1139
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,761
lt's okay. lt's okay.

1140
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:13,018
— l'm so scared.
— l know. l know. l know.

1141
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,006
My name is Robert Hawkins.

1142
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:47,886
lt's 6:42 a.m. on Saturday, May 23.

1143
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:52,516
Approximately seven hours ago,
something attacked the city.

1144
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,935
l don't know what it is.

1145
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,271
lf you found this tape… l mean,
if you're watching this right now,

1146
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:01,233
then you probably know more
about it than l do.

1147
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:07,114
Whatever it is,
it killed my brother, Jason Hawkins.

1148
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,283
lt killed my best friend, Hudson Platt,
and Marlena Diamond,

1149
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:12,202
and many, many others.

1150
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,747
We've crashed here in Central Park
and taken shelter under this bridge.

1151
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,166
The military has begun
bombing the creature

1152
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,335
and we're caught in the middle.

1153
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:23,338
Okay. Ready?

1154
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:29,344
lt's okay.

1155
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:34,391
— Beth, look at me.
— l don't know what to say.

1156
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,977
Well, just tell them who you are.

1157
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:44,818
My name is Elizabeth Mclntyre.
l don't know why this is happening.

1158
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,532
But we're gonna wait here
until this passes.

1159
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,996
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

1160
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:07,466
Look at me, Beth.
Look at me. Look at me.

1161
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,926
— l love you.
— l love you.

1162
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,309
l know what l'm talking about.
Come on, admit it.

1163
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,061
You are going to miss me
a little bit, right?

1164
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,605
Yeah, we'll see.

1165
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:23,482
Okay, yeah, all right.

1166
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:25,984
All right, we're almost out of tape.
We got, like, three seconds left.

1167
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:27,194
What do you wanna say?
What do you wanna say?

1168
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,361
Last thing to the camera.

1169
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,490
l had a good day.

1170
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,091
