[CLAIRE CLEARS THROAT]

668
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,264
I never thought my sister
would find someone who cared about...

669
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,684
what other people thought
as much as she did until I met Craig.

670
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,150
Uh....

671
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,695
As you all know,
my sister and Craig are both lawyers...

672
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,490
at big law firms in New York.

673
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,868
But that's not the only thing
they have in common. Um....

674
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,704
They both like the color green...

675
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,291
like Craig's eyes and money.

676
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,881
Um, heh....

677
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,813
You know, someone once told me that...

678
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,107
true love is...

679
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,318
the soul's recognition
of its counterpoint in another.

680
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:46,907
And I think that
that's a very rare thing in this world.

681
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,495
And I think it's something to be valued.

682
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:55,124
And I'm just really happy
that my big sister's found it.

683
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,835

We should probably head back
so they're not looking for us.

00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,276
I always knew my first time
would be on a beach.

690

First time?

691
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,034
You were a virgin?

- What do you mean, what?

against the rules.

to seal the deal. Period.

three years ago?

CLAIRE: Actually, Sack got the governor
to subsidize part of the project.

And now it's the state's only
self-sustaining scallop farm.

From the football game.

He's a good friend.

I'm gonna see a Dr. Epstein...

Hey, Sack, how long have you

Claire and I? What's it been, sweetheart?
A couple years?

Sure.

00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:30,350
Pretty soon we'll be getting married.

the fur or the wool from sheep...

and we turn it into thread
for homeless people to sew.

And then they make it into cloth,
which they in turn sew...

1045
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:10,825
then make little shirts and pants...

1046
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:14,495

It's a pretty good deal.
