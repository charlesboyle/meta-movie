No.

141
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,462
What do you mean, you feel bad?

142
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,675
When someone seems sad,
they don't have any friends

143
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,930
and people make fun of them,
that makes me feel bad for them.

144
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,476
Who is sad and doesn't have any friends?

00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,813
- Sy.
- Sy?

- Yeah.

147
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,905
- Oh, Jake.
- I really feel bad for him.

148
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:43,574
But, Jake,

149
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,453
we don't know that Sy is sad.

150
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:54,043
We really don't know that much
about him, you know.

151
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,755
I mean, he might even have a lot of friends.

152
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:02,384
And he probably has a girlfriend
and a mommy and a daddy who love him.

153
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,139
JAKE: I don't think he does.

154
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,563
That is so sweet of you to think of
somebody else like that, you know.

155
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,360
Listen, Jake,

156
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,323
not everybody is as lucky as we are.

157
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,116
You know?

158
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,538
But maybe if we send them good thoughts,

159
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:34,500
it'll make them feel better.

160
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:40,923
So why don't we close our eyes
and send Sy some good thoughts?

161
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,467
- Okay.
- Okay? All right.

162
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,428
- Ready?
- Yeah.

163
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,331
There.

164
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,005
I bet next time we see Sy,

165
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,507
he won't seem so sad.

166
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,509
Okay.

167
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,930

- Okay.

00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,183

00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,064

Your coach was a little rough.

That's Yoshi. His math skills are weak.
I told you that when you moved him.

We're not talking
a few innocent math errors.

The net-clicks all zero out.
They always zero out.

450
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,407
The problem is the shut-down clicks
don't correspond.

451
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:59,161
They don't come close to matching
the amount of prints we've sold.

452
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:03,082
Then it's probably the reorder counter.

- Well, I asked Larry about that.
- What did he say?

454
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,923
He looked at the counter
and said that it checked out.

Also, in 14 years of servicing,

456
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:16,553

the Oxford English Dictionary,

536
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:53,234
the word "snapshot" was first used in 1808

537
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:57,405
by an English sportsman
by the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.

538

He noted in his diary that almost
every bird he shot that day

was taken by snapshot,

540
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:08,291
meaning a hurried shot,
taken without deliberate aim.

541
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:19,761
"Snapshot," then, was
originally a hunting term.
