Mark, before Tony comes...

6
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,025

When you telephoned this morning...

11
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,286
...I simply said you wrote crime stories...

12
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,413
...and I'd met you once
when you were here before.

13
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,959
Heh. That has a pretty guilty ring to it.
I'd never use it in one of my stories.

One day Tony and I were going to spend
the weekend in the country with friends.

41
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,129
While we were waiting on the platform,
I noticed my handbag was missing...

42
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,714
...and the letter was inside.

43

it had gone.

00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,639
You mean you never found it?

48
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,016
I recovered the handbag
about two weeks later...

49
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,937
...from the lost and found,
but the letter wasn't there.

50
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,732
And then about a week afterwards,
I received a note.

51
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,943
It told me what I had to do
to get the letter back.

52
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,320
Yes. Go ahead. Go on.

53
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,158
I was to draw £50 from my bank
in £5 notes...

54
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,286
...and then change them
for used £1 notes.

55

It said that if I went to the police
or told anyone else...

56
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,917
...he would show the letter
to my husband.

tell Tony and the police.

Do you still play?

242
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,673
No, I've given up tennis,
or rather, tennis gave me up.

00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,927

and I had a good run for my money.

-I sell sports equipment.

but it gives me plenty of spare time.

don't realize how lucky they are.

252
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,867

to living on what I can earn.

253

Well, you can always marry for money.

254
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,913

make a business out of that.

00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,124
-I know I did.
-Why do you think she married you?

256
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,668
Well, I was a tennis star.

257
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,754
You've given up tennis.
She hasn't left you.

258
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,506
She nearly did.

259
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,633
After we married, I played...

260
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,510
...in championships
and took Margot with me.

261
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,845
She didn't like it much,
and when we got back...

262
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,683
...she tried to make me give up tennis
and play husband instead.

263
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,268
In the end, we compromised.

264
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,728
I went alone to America
for the grass-court season...

265
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,731
...and returned after
the national championships.

266
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,068
I soon realized that a lot had happened
while I was away.

267
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,988
For one thing,
she wasn't in love with me anymore.

268
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:10,075
There were phone calls which would
end abruptly if I happened to walk in.

269
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,954
There was an old school friend
used to visit from time to time.

270
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,083
One day we had a row. I wanted to play
in the covered-court tournament...

271
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,794
...and as usual,
she didn't want me to go.

272
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:26,258
I was in the bedroom. The phone rang.
It all sounded pretty urgent.

273
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,177
After that, she seemed keen
that I play in the tournament after all.

274
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,222
So I packed my kit into the car
and drove off.

275
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:37,728
I parked the car two streets away,
walked back in my tracks.

276
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,398
Ten minutes later, she came out
of this house and took a taxi.

277
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,233
I took another.

278
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,445
Her old school friend
lived in a studio in Chelsea.

279
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,363
I could see them
through the studio window...

280
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,866
...as he cooked spaghetti
over a gas ring.

281
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:54,703
They didn't say much.
They just looked very natural together.

282
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,248
You know, it's funny how you can tell
when people are in love.

283
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,001
I went for a walk.

284
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,630
I began to wonder
what would happen if she left me.

285
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,966
I'd have to find some way
of earning a living to begin with.

286
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,762
I suddenly realized
how much I'd grown to depend on her.

287
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,349
All these expensive tastes
I'd acquired while I was at the top.

288
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,394
And now big tennis had finished with me,
and so apparently had my wife.

289
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,397
I can't ever remember being so scared.

290
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,525
I dropped into a pub
and had a couple of drinks.

291
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:30,197
As I sat in the corner,
I thought of all sorts of things.

292
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,658
I thought of three different ways
of killing him.

293
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,993
I even thought of killing her.

294
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,913
That seemed a far more sensible idea.

295
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,208
And just as I was working out how
I could do it, I suddenly saw something...

296
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,378
...which completely changed my mind.

297
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,342
I didn't go to that tournament after all.

298
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,137
When I got back, she was sitting
exactly where you are now.

299
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,266
And I told her I decided to give up tennis
and look after her instead.

300
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,519
Well?

301
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,730
Well, as things turned out,
I needn't have got so worked up after all.

302
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,693
Apparently that spaghetti evening
had been a sort of a fond farewell.

303
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,070
The boyfriend had been called
back to New York.

304
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,446
-Ah, an American?
-Yes.

305
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,490
There were long letters from there.

306
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:17,744
They usually arrived on Thursdays.
And she burned them all except one.

307
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,497
That one she used to transfer
from handbag to handbag.

308
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,499
It was always with her.

309
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,670
That letter became an obsession with me.
I had to find out what was in it.

310
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,755
And finally I did.

311
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,632
That letter made
very interesting reading.

312
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,635
-Do you mean you stole it?
-Yes.

313
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,680
I even wrote her two anonymous notes
offering to sell it back.

314
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:37,931
Why?

315
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,143
I was hoping it would make her
come and tell me all about him...

316
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,185
...but it didn't.

317
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,980
So I kept the letter.

318
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,067
Why are you telling me all this?

319
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,778
Because you're the only person
I can trust.

320
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,745
Anyway, that did it. It must have
put the fear of God into them...

321
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,288
...because the letters stopped...

322
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,665
...and we lived happily ever after.

323
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,543
It was funny to think
that just a year ago...

324
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,255
...I sat in that Knightsbridge pub
actually planning to murder her.

325
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,424
And I might have done it...

326
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,844
...if I hadn't seen something
that changed my mind.

327
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,221
Well? What did you see?

328
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,807
I saw you.

329
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,355
What was so odd about that?

330
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,690
The coincidence.

331
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,109
Only a week before,
I'd been to a reunion dinner...

332
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,195
...and the fellas were talking about you.

333
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,740
How you'd been court-martialed
during the war, a year in prison.

00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,116
That was news.

335
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,661
Mind you, at college, we'd all said
that old Swann would end up in jail.

336
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,955
That cashbox, I suppose.

337
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,207
Well, what about it?

338
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,044
Oh, my dear fellow,
everybody knew you took that money.

339
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,296
Poor old Alfred.

340
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,804
Thanks very much for the drink.

341
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,972
Interesting, hearing about
your matrimonial affairs.

342
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,183
I take it you won't be wanting that car
after all.

343
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,894
Don't you want me to tell you
why I brought you here?

344
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,689
Yes, I think you'd better.

345
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,400
It was when I saw you in that pub
that it happened.

346
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,694
Suddenly everything became quite clear.

347
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,282
Only a few months before,
Margot and I had made our wills...

348
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,450
...quite short affairs...

349
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,161
...leaving everything we had to each other
in case of accidents.

350
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,874
Hers worked out at just over £90,000.
Investments mostly.

351
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,751
All a little too easy to get at.

352
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,171
And that was dangerous
as they'd be bound to suspect me.

353
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,259
I needed an alibi, a very good one.

354
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,386
Then I saw you.

355
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,305
I often wondered what happened to people
when they came out of prison.

356
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,851
People like you, I mean.
Can they get jobs?

357
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:51,231
Do old friends rally round?
Suppose they'd never had any friends.

358
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,442
I became so curious to know
that I followed you.

359
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,736
I followed you home that night.

360
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,906
And-- Would you mind
passing me your glass, old boy?

361
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,452
Thank you. Thank you very much.
And I've been following you ever since.

362
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Why?

363
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,456
I was hoping that sooner or later
I might catch you at something...

364
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,958
...and be able to, uh....

365
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,003
-Blackmail me?
-Influence you.

366
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,630
After a couple of weeks,
I got to know your routine...

367
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,257
...and that made it a lot easier.

368
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,093
-Rather dour work.
-To begin with, yes.

369
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,304
But you know how it is.
You take up a hobby...

370
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,348
...and the more you get to know it,
the more fascinating it becomes.

371
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,309
You became quite fascinating.

372
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,354
In fact, there were times when I felt
that you almost belonged to me.

373
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,273
That must have been interesting.

374
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,109
You used to go to the dog racing
Mondays and Thursdays.

375
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,737
I even took it up myself,
just to be near you.

376
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,907
You'd changed your name to Adams.

377
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,576
Yes. I got bored with Swann.
Any crime in that?

378
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,745
No, no. None whatever.

379
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,539
In fact, there was nothing really illegal
about you.

380
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,917
I got quite discouraged.

381
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,711
Then one day,
you disappeared from your lodgings.

382
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,673
I phoned your landlady.
I said Mr. Adams owed me £5.

383
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,091
But apparently that was nothing.

384
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,055
Mr. Adams owed her six weeks' rent
and her best lodger £55.

385
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,766
And Mr. Adams had been
such a nice gentleman.

386
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,018
That's what seemed to upset her most.

387
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,396
Yes. That always seems
to upset them most.

388
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,607
I say, old boy,
if you want another drink...

389
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,901
...do you mind putting on these gloves?

390
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,028
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes, I'd lost you...

391
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,489
...and then I found you
one day at the dog racing.

392
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,867
And I tailed you home
to your new lodgings in Belsize Park.

393
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,370
There Mr. Adams became Mr. Wilson.

394
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,498
Mr. Wilson left Belsize Park
owing 16 weeks' rent...

395
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,752
...and somewhat richer
for a brief encounter with a Miss Wallace.

396
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,047
You used to take Miss Wallace out
on Wednesdays and Sundays.

397
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,591
She certainly was in love with you,
wasn't she?

398
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,679
I suppose she thought you were growing
that handsome mustache to please her.

399
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,764
Poor Miss Wallace.

400
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,183
This is all very interesting. Do go on.

401
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,813
July, August, September.
Apartment 127, Carlisle Court.

402
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,815
Occupant, a Mrs. Van Dorn.

403
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:01,236
Her late husband left her two hotels
and a large apartment house, furnished.

404
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,030
What a base to operate from,
Captain Lesgate.

405
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,075
The only trouble is,
she does rather enjoy being courted...

406
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,910
...and she's so very expensive.

407
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,956
Perhaps that's why you've been trying
to sell her car for over a month.

408
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,375
Mrs. Van Dorn asked me to sell it for her.

409
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,461
I know. I called her up
just before you arrived here.

410
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,046
She only wanted 800.

411
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,802
Where's the nearest police station?

412
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,971
Opposite the church. Two minutes' walk.

413
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,599
-Suppose I walk there now.
-What would you tell them?

414
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,600
Everything.

415
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,852
Everything?

416
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,062
All about Mr. Adams and Mr. Wilson?

417
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,483
I should simply tell them
that you're trying to blackmail me into--

418
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,943
Into?

419
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,404
Murdering your wife.

420
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,157
I almost wish you would.
When she heard that...

421
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,242
...we'd have the biggest laugh of our lives.

422
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,578
-Aren't you forgetting something?
-Am I?

423
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,330
-You've told me quite a lot tonight.
-What of it?

424
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,459
Suppose I tell them how you followed her
to that studio in Chelsea...

425
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,961
...and watched them cooking spaghetti,
and all that rubbish?

426
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,964
-Will that ring a bell?
-Oh, it certainly would.

427
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,883
They'd assume
you followed her yourself.

428
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,677
-Me? Why should I?
-Why should you steal her handbag?

429
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,846
Why should you write her
all those blackmail notes?

430
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:15,226
Can you prove you didn't?
You certainly can't prove I did.

431
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,604
It'd be a straight case
of your word against mine.

432
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,066
That would puzzle them, wouldn't it?
What could you say?

433
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,611
I shall simply say
that you came here tonight half-drunk...

434
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,196
...and, uh, tried to borrow money...

435
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,406
...on the strength
that we were at college together.

436
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,408
When I refused,
you mentioned something...

437
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,452
...about a letter belonging to my wife.

438
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,455
As far as I could make out,
you tried to sell it to me.

439
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,875
I gave you what money I had
and you gave me the letter.

440
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,461
It has your fingerprints on it, remember?

441
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,925
Then you said if I went to the police...

442
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,470
...you'd tell some crazy story
about my wanting you to murder my wife.

443
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:55,809
But before you go any further, old boy,
do consider the inconvenience.

444
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:00,563
You see, I'm quite well-known.
And there'd be pictures of you as well.

445
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,858
And sooner or later, there'd be a deputation
of landladies and lodgers...

446
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,778
...who would step forward
to testify to your character.

447
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,616
And someone is almost certain
to have seen you with Miss Wallace.

448
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,328
You were careful not to be seen
around with her, I noticed.

449
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:19,374
You usually met in out-of-the-way places
where you wouldn't be recognized...

450
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,086
...like the little tea shop in Pimlico.

451
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,004
That was her idea, not mine.

452
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,048
Yes, it was a bit crummy, wasn't it?

453
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,676
Hardly the place to take Mrs. Van Dorn.

454
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,555
By the way, does Mrs. Van Dorn
know about Mr. Adams and Mr. Wilson...

455
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,265
...and Miss Wallace?

456
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,059
You were planning to marry Mrs. Van Dorn,
weren't you?

457
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,186
-Smart, aren't you?
-No, not really.

458
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:44,149
I've just had time to think things out,
put myself in your position.

459
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,818
That's why I know you're going to agree.

460
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,195
What makes you think I'll agree?

461
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,574
For the same reason that a donkey with
a stick behind him and a carrot in front...

462
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,577
...always goes forwards
and not backwards.

463
00:24:56,078 --> 00:25:00,373
-Tell me about the carrot.
-One thousand pounds in cash.

464
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,958
For a murder?

465
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:05,837
For a few minutes' work, that's all it is.
And no risk, I guarantee.

466
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,966
That ought to appeal to you.
You've been skating on pretty thin ice.

467
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:14,429
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-You ought to know. It was in all the papers.

468
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,640
Middle-aged woman found dead
due to an overdose of something.

469
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,976
She had been taking the stuff
for quite some time...

470
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,603
...and nobody knows where she got it.

471
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,189
But we know, don't we?

472
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,150
Poor Miss Wallace.

473
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,406
This £1000. Where is it?

474
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,577
It's in a small attaché case
in a checkroom.

475
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,912
SWANN:
Where?

476
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,580
Somewhere in London.

477
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,582
Of course we don't meet again.

478
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,084
As soon as you've delivered the goods...

479
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,838
...I shall mail you the checkroom ticket
and the key to the case.

480
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,841
You can take this £100 on account.

481
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
The police would only have to trace
one of these notes back to you...

482
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,725
...to hang us both from the same rope.

483
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,143
They won't.

484
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,938
For a whole year,
I've been cashing an extra £20 a week.

485
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,400
Always in fivers.
I then change them for those at my leisure.

486
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,861
Let me see your bank statement?

487
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,404
By all means.

488
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,036
Don't touch.

489
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,501
Turn back a page.

490
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,885
Ah. Your balance has dropped
by over £1000 during the year.

491
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,637
Suppose the police ask you about that.

492
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,014
I go dog racing twice a week.

493
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,724
They'll check your bookmaker.

494
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,018
Like you, I always bet on the tout.

495
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,728
Satisfied?

496
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,983
When would this take place?

497
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,359
Tomorrow night.

498
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,611
Tomorrow? Not a chance.

499
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,446
I've gotta think this over.

500
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,492
It has to be tomorrow.
I've arranged things that way.

501
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,619
Where?

502
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,247
Approximately where
you're standing now.

503
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,625
How?

504
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,211
Tomorrow evening, Halliday,
the American boyfriend, and I...

505
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,673
...will go out to a stag party.
She'll stay here.

506
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,759
She'll go to bed early and listen to
<i>Saturday Night Theatre on the radio.</i>

507
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,636
She always does when I'm out.

508
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,305
At exactly three minutes to 11...

509
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,765
...you'll enter the house
through the street door.

510
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,268
You'll find the key to this door...

511
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,565
...under the stair carpet here.

512
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,401
-The fifth step.
-That's the one.

513
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,654
Go straight to the window...

514
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,073
...and hide behind the curtains.

515
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,117
At exactly 11:00...

516
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,953
...I shall go to the telephone
in the hotel to call my boss.

517
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:48,291
I shall dial the wrong number,
this number. That's all I shall do.

518
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,751
When the phone rings...

519
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,920
...you'll see the light go on
under her bedroom door.

520
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,299
When she opens it,
the light will stream across the room.

521
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,302
So don't move
until she answers the phone.

522
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,096
There must be as little noise as possible.

523
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,140
After you've finished...

524
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,268
...pick up the phone
and give me a soft whistle, and hang up.

525
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,021
Don't speak, whatever you do.
I shan't say a word.

526
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,066
When I hear your whistle,
I shall hang up and redial...

527
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,151
...but the correct number this time.

528
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,113
I shall then talk to my boss as if nothing
had happened and return to the party.

529
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,032
Well, what happens next? Go on.

530
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,284
You'll see the suitcase here.

531
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,620
It contains some clothes of mine
for the cleaners.

532
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,290
Open it and tip the clothes out
onto the floor.

533
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,168
Fill it with a cigarette box
and some of these cups.

534
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,380
Close the lid, but don't snap the locks.

535
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,757
Then leave the suitcase there
just as it is now.

536
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,176
-Ah, as if I'd left in a hurry.
-That's the idea.

537
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,844
Now the window.

538
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,973
If it's locked, unlock it and leave it open.

539
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,102
Then go out exactly the same way
you came in.

540
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,437
-By this door?
-Yes.

541
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,564
And here's the most important thing:

542
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,026
As you go out, return the key
to the place where you found it.

543
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,445
-Under the stair carpet?
-Yes.

544
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,115
Yes, but what exactly
is supposed to have happened?

545
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,035
They'll assume
you came in by the window.

546
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,745
You thought the apartment was empty...

547
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,289
...so you took the suitcase
and went to work.

548
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:14,836
She heard something.
She switched on her light.

549
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,256
You saw the light under the door
and hid behind the curtains.

550
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:22,385
When she came in here,
you attacked her before she could scream.

551
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,346
When you realized
you'd actually killed her...

552
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,306
...you panicked,
bolted through the garden...

553
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,684
-...and left the loot behind you.
-Just a minute.

554
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,688
I'm supposed to have come in
through these windows.

555
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,358
-Suppose they'd been locked.
-It wouldn't matter.

556
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,278
You see, she often walks around
the garden before she goes to bed...

557
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,364
...and she usually forgets to lock up
when she gets back.

558
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,533
That's what I shall tell the police.

559
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,161
Yes, but she may say that....

560
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,790
But she isn't going to say anything,
is she?

561
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,922
All right. I leave the apartment.

562
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,177
I put the key back under the stair carpet
and go out by the street door.

563
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,430
Suppose the street door's locked.
How do I get in in the first place?

564
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,140
The street door is never locked.

565
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,559
-What time will you get back?
-About 12.

566
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,437
I'll bring Halliday back for a nightcap
so we'll find her together.

567
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,814
And we shall have been together
since we left her...

568
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,983
...and there's my alibi.

569
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,791
-You've forgotten something.
-What?

570
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,669
When you get back
with what's-his-name, Halliday...

571
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,797
-...how will you get into the apartment?
-I shall let myself in.

572
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,925
But your key
will be under the stair carpet.

573
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,260
He'll see you getting it out.
It'll give the show away.

574
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,972
No. It won't be my key under the carpet,
it'll be hers.

575
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,683
I shall take it from her handbag
and hide it out there...

576
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,685
...just before I leave the flat.

577
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,522
She's not going out,
so she won't miss it.

578
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,651
When I come back with Halliday,
I'll use my own key to let us in.

579
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,154
Then while he's out searching
the garden or something...

580
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,574
...I'll take the key from under the carpet

This is the maharaja. Isn't he dreamy?

00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,314
I'll explain that when you come.
How long will it take?

830
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,108
<i>-About two minutes.</i>
-Two minutes?

831
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,318
And don't touch anything, will you, sir?

832
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,487
No, we won't touch anything. Goodbye.

833
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,447
I'll get dressed.

834
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,032
Why?

835
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:37,784
They'll want to see me.

836
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:41,287
-They're not going to see you.
-But they'll have to ask me questions.

837
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,582
They can wait till tomorrow.
I'll tell them all they need to know.

838
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,043
-Tony.
-Yes?

839
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,253
Why did you phone me?

840
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:49,921
What?

841
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,924
I'm sorry, darling,
I'll tell you about that later.

842
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,302
I just thought of something.
You said he used a stocking?

843
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,431
I think it was a stocking or a scarf.
Isn't it there?

844
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,601
No, but I expect they'll find it.
Now, you go on to bed.

845
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,968

MAN 3: Mm-hm?

848
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,532
MAN 2:
Look, it's the other stocking.

849
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,844
MAN:
All right, break it up. Let's get moving on.

850
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,871
Hm. Almost empty.
Remind me to get some more.

851
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,748
It always runs out just when we need it.

852
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,501
Oh, look, before I forget,
the sergeant wanted to know...

853
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,503
...why you didn't phone
the police immediately.

854
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:01,089
-How could I? You were on the phone.
-I know, but--

855
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,883
You distinctly told me
not to speak to anyone until you got here.

856
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,303
I know, darling, but I told him
a slightly different story.

857
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,262
Why?

858
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,015
Well, I said you didn't phone the police
because you assumed...

859
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,059
...that I would do it from the hotel.

860
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,560
Why did you say that?

861
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,981
Because it was the perfectly
logical explanation, and he accepted it.

862
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,484
Now, if they get the idea
that we delayed reporting it...

863
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,237
...they might get nosy
and start asking all sorts of questions--

864
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:28,157
-So you want me to say the same thing?
-I think so, dear, in case it comes up again.

Good morning, madam.

Oh. Good morning.

00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,086
-Mrs. Wendice?
-Yes.

-I'm a police officer. May I come in?
-Of course.

Excuse me.
I'll just tell my husband you're here.

00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,182
Oh, thank you.

TONY:
Good morning.

874
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,168
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Inspector Hubbard...

875
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,670
...in charge of criminal investigation
of this division.

876
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,173
We gave your sergeant
all the necessary information.

877
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,050
Yes. I've seen his report, of course...

878
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:31,012
...but there are a few things
I'd like to get firsthand.

879
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:35,016
I gather the sergeant only saw you
for a few moments, Mrs. Wendice?

880
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,225
Yes, I--

881
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,394
My wife was suffering
from considerable shock.

882
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,189
Yes, that was a very nasty experience
you had.

883
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,899
Do you mind if I take a look around?

884
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,693
Go ahead. The bedroom and bathroom
are through here.

885
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,042
He certainly didn't get in
by the bathroom.

886
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,549
And the kitchen has bars on the window.

887
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,557
We assume he must have come in
through these windows here.

888
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,268
I, uh-- I understand you weren't here
when this happened.

889
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,938
No, I was at a dinner party
at the Grendon Hotel.

890
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,356
And by a curious coincidence...

891
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:25,691
...I was actually phoning my wife
when she was attacked.

892
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,903
So I gather. Can you tell me
exactly what time it was, sir?

893
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:33,074
No, I'm afraid I can't.
I do remember my watch had stopped.

894
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,246
Did you notice, Mrs. Wendice?

895
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,039
No, I didn't.

896
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,582
Won't you sit down, inspector?

897
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,584
Thank you.

898
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,506
Have you any idea who he was?

899
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,386
Hmm? Oh, yes. At least,
we've discovered where he lived.

900
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:56,681
There still seems to be some confusion
as to his real name.

901
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,683
MARGOT: Oh?
-He appeared to have several.

902
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,604
-Had you ever seen him before?
-Why, no, of course not.

903
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:06,858
Oh.

904
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,901
-Is this him?
-Yes.

905
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:12,488
-You don't recognize him?
-No, I never saw him.

906
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:15,199
But didn't you even catch
a glimpse of his face?

907
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,368
No. You see,
he attacked me from behind...

908
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:20,454
...and it was dark. I hardly saw him at all.

909
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,250
But before I showed you these photographs,
you said you'd never seen him...

910
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,168
...before.

911
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,629
How could you know that
if you never saw his face last night?

912
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,089
I don't quite understand.

913
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,842
Inspector, my wife simply means
that as far as she knew...

914
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,886
...she never saw him before.

915
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,762
-Was that what you meant?
-Yes.

916
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,640
Yeah. Now, how about you, sir?
Had you ever seen him before?

917
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:45,521
No.

918
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,565
-At least....
-Yes?

919
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,193
It's very like someone
I was at college with.

920
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,153
But the mustache
makes quite a difference.

921
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:53,738
Oh? What was his name?

922
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:56,699
Oh, I don't know.
It must be 20 years since I left.

923
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,994
-Was it, uh, Lesgate?
-No.

924
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,954
-Wilson?
-No.

925
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:02,788
Swann?

926
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,291
N-- Swann?

927
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,420
Wait a minute. Swann. Yes, that's it.

928
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,470
Here's an old photo taken at a reunion.
We were at the same college together.

929
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:18,804
There he is there.

930
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,724
-Why, it's unbelievable.
-Did you know him well?

931
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,267
No. He was senior to me.

932
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,394
-Have you met him since then?
-No.

933
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,104
At least....

934
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,358
Come to think of it, I did see him
quite recently, but not to speak to.

935
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,611
-Oh? When was that?
-Six months ago at a railway station.

936
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:34,946
Victoria, I think.

937
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,490
I remember noticing
how little he'd changed.

938
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,534
-Had he a mustache then, sir?
-No.

939
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:44,914
Hm. Uh, Mrs. Wendice, would you show me
exactly what happened last night?

940
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,834
-Tony, do I have to?
-I'm afraid so, darling.

941
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,636
I was in bed when the phone rang,
and I got up and I came in here.

942
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,888
-Did you switch this light on?
-No.

943
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,599
Just show me
exactly where you were standing.

944
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,983
I stood here and I picked up the phone.

945
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,109
HUBBARD:
Just one moment.

946
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,611
Are you sure you had
your back to the window like that?

947
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,321
Yes.

948
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,699
-But why?
-Why not?

949
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:24,912
Heh. I mean, why go around the desk?
I should have picked it up from this side.

950
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,998
But I always answer the phone
from here.

951
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,416
But why?

952
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:32,545
In case I have to write anything down.
I can hold the phone in my left hand.

953
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,300
I see. I'm sorry. Go on.

954
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,884
When I picked up the phone...

955
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,388
...he must have come from
behind those curtains and attacked me.

956
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,391
-He got something around my neck.
-What do you mean by "something"?

957
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,601
MARGOT:
I think it was a stocking.

958
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,146
HUBBARD:
I see. And what happened then?

959
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,190
MARGOT:
Well, then he pushed me across the desk.

960
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,192
I distinctly remember
feeling for the scissors.

961
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,361
HUBBARD:
Where were those scissors usually kept?

962
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:00,823
In that mending basket.
I'd forgotten to put them away.

963
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,243
Now, what makes you think
he came from behind those curtains?

964
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,870
Where else could he have been?

965
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,204
-The curtains were drawn?
-Yes.

966
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,622
Did you draw them yourself?

967
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,958
No, inspector, I drew them
just before I went out.

968
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,461
-Did you lock the window at the same time?
-Yes.

969
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,046
Are you quite sure of that, sir?

970
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,882
Oh, perfectly sure. I always lock up
when I draw the curtains.

971
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,801
-Then how do you suppose he got in?
-We assume that he broke in.

972
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,511
Well, there's no sign of a break-in.

973
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,514
Our report shows
the lock's quite undamaged.

974
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:26,640
Mrs. Wendice...

975
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,185
...why didn't you call the police...

976
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:31,062
...immediately this happened?

977
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:36,859
I was trying to get through
to the police...

978
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,236
...when I discovered
my husband was on the line.

979
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:42,073
I naturally thought
he would call the police from the hotel...

980
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,033
...before he came here.

981
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,328
Uh, didn't it occur to you to call a doctor?

982
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,413
MARGOT: No.
-Why ever not?

983
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,833
-He was dead.
-How did you know that?

984
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,127
I.... It was obvious.

985
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,172
-Did you feel his pulse?
-No, of course I didn't.

986
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:02,009
Anyone would have realized he was dead.
Just one look at those staring eyes--

987
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,136
Oh, so you did see his face, after all.

988
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,515
I saw his eyes! I can't remember his face!

989
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,601
Inspector, my wife obviously
had never seen this man before.

990
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,978
If he didn't come in by those windows,
how did he get in?

991
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,318
As a matter of fact, we're quite certain
that he came in by this door.

992
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,862
MARGOT:
But it was locked.

993
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,949
Margot, did you open that door
at all after we'd gone?

994
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:25,866
No.

995
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:28,869
-How many keys are there to this door?
-Only two.

996
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:31,664
Mine was in my handbag,
and you had yours with you.

997
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,582
Yes, that's right.

998
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,793
-Has the caretaker got a key?
-No.

999
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,294
HUBBARD:
Do you employ a charwoman?

1000
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,631
MARGOT: Yes, but she hasn't got one
either. I'm always here when she comes.

1001
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,508
What makes you think
he came in this way?

1002
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,302
His shoes.

1003
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,512
His shoes?

1004
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,974
The ground was soaking wet last night.

1005
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:53,686
And if he'd come in by the garden,
he'd have left mud all over the carpet.

1006
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:55,813
As it is, he didn't leave any marks at all...

1007
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,315
...because he wiped his shoes
on the front doormat.

1008
01:02:58,567 --> 01:02:59,358
How can you tell?

1009
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,945
It's a fairly new mat and some
of its fibers came off on his shoes.

1010
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:03,779
Oh, but surely--

1011
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:08,159
And there was a small tar stain on the mat,
and some of the fibers show that as well.

1012
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,785
No, there's no question about it.

1013
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,999
Wait a minute. I think I've got it.

1014
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,418
You remember when your bag
was stolen?

1015
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:18,252
MARGOT:
Yes.

1016
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,713
TONY:
Wasn't the key inside?

1017
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,090
MARGOT: Yes, but it was still there
when I got it back.

1018
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,926
Now, just a moment.
I'd like to hear about this.

1019
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,219
What sort of bag?

1020
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,763
A handbag, inspector.
My wife lost it at Victoria Station.

1021
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,975
But I got it back from the lost and found
about two weeks later.

1022
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:33,976
Was anything missing?

1023
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:35,936
All the money was gone.

1024
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,480
-Anything else?
-No.

1025
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,858
-I mean, no papers or letters?
-No.

1026
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,943
Are you quite sure about that?

1027
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,069
Yes.

1028
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,739
Your latchkey was in your handbag
when you lost it?

1029
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:49,158
Yes, but it was still there
when it was returned.

1030
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,494
Whoever stole the money
could have copied the key.

1031
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,829
Where was the bag found eventually?

1032
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,956
At Victoria Station.

1033
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,375
Wasn't that where you said
you saw this man, sir?

1034
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,753
When did you lose the bag?

1035
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,130
Wasn't it that weekend
we went to visit Peggy?

1036
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,300
Yes, it was. I remember now.
He was sitting in the restaurant.

1037
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:07,843
HUBBARD:
That where you left your bag?

1038
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,472
Yes, and didn't I say something about
"There's someone I was at college with"?

1039
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,766
I don't remember.

1040
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:15,851
That's how he got in.
He had a duplicate made...

1041
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:19,104
-...and returned the original to the bag.
-Before you go any further...

1042
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,649
...how did he get in
through the street door?

1043
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,526
TONY:
Well, the street door is never locked.

1044
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,236
I see.

1045
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,155
He could have had your key copied...

1046
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:31,492
...and he could have used it
to open the door...

1047
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,828
...but of course he didn't.

1048
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:36,121
Why not?

1049
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,122
Because if he had...

1050
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,500
...the key would still
have been on him when he died.

1051
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,502
No key was found
when we went through his pockets.

1052
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,133
We seem to be back
just where we started, don't we?

1053
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,469
Well, not quite.

1054
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,513
Well, then how did he get in?

1055
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,558
We'd better get all this down on paper.

1056
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,977
I'd like you both to make
an official statement...

1057
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,520
...before the inquest.

1058
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:02,439
My office is only a few moments
from here. Perhaps you could come now.

1059
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,983
[DOORBELL BUZZES]

1060
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,363
MARK: Tony.
-Mark. Oh, this is Inspector Hubbard.

1061
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:12,074
Inspector, this is Mark Halliday.
He was with me last night.

1062
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,325
How do you do, inspector?

1063
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:17,121
As you were with Mr. Wendice last night,
you may be able to help us here.

1064
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:20,874
Now, did you notice what time it was
he went to the phone?

1065
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,544
Yes, matter of fact,
it was just three minutes after 11.

1066
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,629
How did you come to notice that?

1067
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,674
Well, Mr. Wendice's watch had stopped
and some of us compared times.

1068
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,802
Thank you. So you see,
it was when Mrs. Wendice came in here...

1069
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,847
...to answer his call
that she was attacked.

1070
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,766
Did you phone Margot
before or after you phoned your boss?

1071
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,602
Tony, I know what I wanted to ask you.

1072
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,436
Why did you...

1073
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,645
...telephone me last night?

1074
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:45,190
Now, just one moment,
before I lose the thread of this.

1075
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,153
Now, at three minutes past 11,
you left your party to phone your boss.

1076
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,904
Yes, I used the pay phone in the lobby.

1077
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:54,533
How long were you on the telephone
to your boss before you called your wife?

1078
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,953
In fact, I never did speak to him.
I couldn't remember his number...

1079
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,123
...so I rang my wife to ask her
to look it up in the address book.

1080
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,709
You mean you hauled me out of bed
just to get his number?

1081
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:04,877
I had to, darling.

1082
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,795
My boss is flying to Brussels
this morning.

1083
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,673
I wanted to remind him of something.
It was rather important.

1084
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,967
Wasn't there a telephone directory
in the hotel?

1085
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,386
Yes, but his country number
wouldn't be in that directory.

1086
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,722
Mm. And did you phone him?

1087
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,184
Oh, no. Naturally when I heard what
had happened here, I forgot all about it.

1088
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:23,187
Mm. Yes.

1089
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,981
Mr. Halliday, Mr. and Mrs. Wendice
are coming to my office...

1090
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,566
...to make their statements.

1091
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,694
Would you give me your address, sir?
I may want to get in touch with you.

1092
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,655
-Why, certainly.
-I'll get my coat.

1093
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,281
I'm staying at Carfax Hotel.

1094
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,159
Just write it down there, will you?
Your telephone number as well.

1095
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,786
All right.

1096
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,962
Ever been over here before, sir?

1097
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:52,675
-Uh, yes. Yes, about a year ago.
-Mm.

1098
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,219
-There you are, sir.
-Thank you.

1099
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,012
Uh, Mr. Wendice.

1100
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,931
There's quite a crowd
in front of the house.

1101
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:01,266
I was going to suggest
that we left by the garden.

1102
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,227
-Isn't there a gate at the far end?
-Yes.

1103
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:06,271
I'm afraid the gate may be locked.
Would you mind taking a look, sir?

1104
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,981
Certainly.

1105
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,949
How much does he know
about you and Mrs. Wendice?

1106
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:19,868
I beg your pardon?

1107
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,413
You wrote a letter to Mrs. Wendice
from New York.

1108
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,499
It was found
in the dead man's inside pocket.

1109
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:29,420
I didn't mention it because I wasn't sure
how much Mr. Wendice knew.

1110
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,547
Have you any idea how it got there?

1111
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:32,923
No.

1112
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,636
-Where's Tony?
-He's just gone into the garden.

1113
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:40,264
Mrs. Wendice,
when you lost your handbag...

1114
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,224
...did you lose a letter as well?

1115
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:44,017
No.

1116
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:47,312
MARK: Margot, it was found
in the dead man's pocket.

1117
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,815
HUBBARD:
You did lose it, didn't you?

1118
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,609
Yes, I did.

1119
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,528
I asked you that before, didn't I?

1120
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:58,240
Yes, but you see, my husband
didn't know about it.

1121
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,451
This man was blackmailing you,
wasn't he?

1122
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,368
It's no good.

1123
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:02,661
-Tony will have to know.
-No.

1124
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,329
It's the only thing we can do. Inspector...

1125
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,709
...after Mrs. Wendice lost my letter,
she received these two notes.

1126
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,674
HUBBARD:
Last October.

1127
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,801
How many times
have you seen this man?

1128
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,345
I've never seen him.

1129
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,848
-I'd like you to come along with us.
-Yes, of course.

1130
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:26,393
Mrs. Wendice, when you come
to make your statement...

1131
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,896
...there may be other
police officers present.

1132
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:31,356
I shall warn you first
that anything you say...

1133
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,901
...will be taken down
and may be used in evidence.

1134
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,278
Now, never mind
what you've told me so far.

1135
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,655
We'll forget all about that.

1136
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,201
But from now on, tell us exactly
what you know about this man...

1137
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,286
...and exactly what happened last night.

1138
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:45,954
If you try and conceal...

1139
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,080
...anything at all...

1140
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,625
...it may put you
in a very serious position.

1141
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:52,002
MARK: I wish you'd explain
what you mean by all this.

1142
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:56,340
I will. Now, you admit
that you killed this man.

1143
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:58,467
Well, you say you did it in self-defense.

1144
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,011
Unfortunately, there were no witnesses...

1145
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,305
...so we've only your word for that.

1146
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,975
But I heard it all, inspector,
over the telephone.

1147
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,102
What exactly did you hear, Mr. Wendice?

1148
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,939
Well, I heard a series of faint cries.

1149
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,359
Well, did you hear anything to indicate
that a struggle was going on?

1150
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:19,321
What I did hear, inspector, is perfectly
consistent with what my wife told me.

1151
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:23,826
So all you really know of the matter
is what your wife told you, isn't it?

1152
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:27,496
Now, you suggest that
this man came to burgle your flat...

1153
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,081
...but there's no evidence of that.

1154
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,959
There is evidence, however,
that he was blackmailing you.

1155
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:34,127
Blackmail?

1156
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:35,629
MARK:
Yes, I'm afraid that's true.

1157
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,798
HUBBARD: And you suggest
he came in by the window.

1158
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:40,342
And we know that he came in
by that door.

1159
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,220
But he can't have come in that way.
That door was locked.

1160
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,847
And there are only two keys.

1161
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,558
My husband had his with him
and mine was in my handbag. Here.

1162
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,894
You could have let him in.

1163
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,230
TONY: Are you suggesting
she let him in herself?

1164
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,191
HUBBARD: That appears to be
the only way he could've entered.

1165
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,986
Don't you even believe I was attacked?

1166
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,321
How do you think
I got these bruises on my throat?

1167
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:04,616
You could have caused
those bruises yourself.

1168
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,912
A silk stocking was found
outside the window.

1169
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,498
It had two knots tied in it.

1170
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,709
Does that mean anything to you?

1171
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,336
I suppose it must have been
the stocking he used.

1172
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:20,632
We found the twin stocking
hidden underneath this blotting pad.

1173
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,427
Can you explain why your attacker
should do that?

1174
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,470
No.

1175
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,306
Those stockings were yours,
weren't they?

1176
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:28,640
MARGOT:
No.

1177
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:29,933
HUBBARD:
We know they were.

1178
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:34,521
One of the heels had been darned
with some silk that didn't quite match.

1179
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:37,149
We found a reel of that silk
in your mending basket.

1180
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:43,238
Tony, there was a pair of stockings here.

1181
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:51,330
I've heard of the police deliberately
planting clues to ensure a conviction.

1182
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,041
His men were here for hours last night.

1183
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,793
They could've taken those stockings
and done anything with them.

1184
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:57,711
Of course they did.

1185
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,713
Probably wiped his shoes
on the doormat as well.

MAN:
<i>Hello?</i>

1187
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:04,092
Oh, hello, Roger, thank heaven you're in.
Tony Wendice here.

1188
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,137
Uh, listen, we had a burglary last night
and Margot was attacked.

1189
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,722
<i>Margot? Was she hurt?</i>

1190
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,600
No, she's all right, but the man was killed,
and the police are here.

1191
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:12,643
And don't laugh...

1192
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,145
...they're suggesting
that Margot killed him intentionally.

1193
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,064
I wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.

1194
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,690
<i>Well, that's a good one. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

1195
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,150
TONY:
Yes, it is funny, isn't it?

1196
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:23,278
Now, Roger, could you come around
at once, Maida Vale Police Station?

1197
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,073
<i>-I'll be there right away.</i>
TONY: Oh, thanks, old boy. Goodbye.

1198
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,951
It's all right, darling. Roger's gonna
meet us at the police station.

1199
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,786
Mr. Wendice, I should advise you--

1200
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:33,789
Our lawyer will give us
any advice we need, thank you.

1201
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,043
MARK:
Margot.

1202
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,921
-Here's your handbag.
-Thank you.

1203
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,883
-You are coming?
-Oh, but of course, inspector.

1204
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:48,720
Yes. Yes, well, I just--
I mean, I just wondered.

1205
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,324
MAN 1: I charge you
that on the 26th of September...

1206
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,995
...you did willfully murder
Charles Alexander Swann.

1207
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,665
Do you wish to say anything
in answer to this charge?

1208
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:25,507
MAN 2: And did you, at any time
in your life, meet this man, Swann?

1209
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,262
MAN 3:
You received a letter from Mr. Halliday.

1210
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:33,348
This letter was found
in the dead man's pocket.

1211
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:36,268
Now you say you did not know him?

1212
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:43,734
JUDGE: Do you find the prisoner,
Margot Mary Wendice...

1213
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:47,279
...guilty or not guilty?

1214
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,990
FOREMAN:
Guilty.

1215
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,663
JUDGE:
The sentence of this court...

1216
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,625
...is that you be taken to the place
from whence you came...

1217
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:04,421
...from thence to a place
of lawful execution.

1218
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,376
[DOORBELL BUZZES]

1219
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,849
-Oh, hello, Mark.
-Tony.

1220
01:13:58,726 --> 01:13:59,726
I--

1221
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:10,112
Have you, uh, gotten any news
from the Home Secretary?

1222
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,038
Then it's tomorrow?

1223
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,461
Tony, I take it you'd do anything
to save her life.

1224
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,589
-We've done everything.
-No, Tony, we haven't done everything.

1225
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,717
I've been trying to figure out something
for weeks in case it came to this.

1226
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:36,263
-Now I really believe it's her only chance.
-Let's have it.

1227
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,517
Margot was convicted
because nobody believed her story.

1228
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:43,270
The prosecution made out
she was telling one lie after another...

1229
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,646
...and the jury believed him.

1230
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,607
But what did his case really amount to?
Just three things:

1231
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,235
My letter, her stocking...

1232
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,737
...and the fact that
because no key was found on Swann...

1233
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,991
-...she must've let him in herself.
-Don't try and tell me--

1234
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,119
Wait a minute, Tony. Now, hear me out.
This is where you come in.

1235
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:00,996
You go to the police and tell them...

1236
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:02,414
...some story...

1237
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:05,333
...anything that will convince them
Margot wasn't lying after all.

1238
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,211
The police aren't likely to believe
anything I might tell them.

1239
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,381
Tony, I've been writing this stuff
for years.

1240
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,884
I've figured out something
for you to tell them.

1241
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,636
Now, let's take those points one by one.

1242
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,766
Margot says she never let Swann in
through this door.

1243
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,810
Okay.

1244
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:26,354
He must have opened it somehow.

1245
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:30,567
Suppose you tell the police that
you left your key out here somewhere.

1246
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:34,112
Then Swann could have let himself in.

1247
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,240
-How'd he know it was there?
-You told him.

1248
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,117
But I haven't met Swann in 20 years.

1249
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:44,414
Tony, Swann is dead.
Now, we've gotta make the most of that.

1250
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:46,041
You can tell any story about him now.

1251
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,460
You can even say
that you two met somewhere...

1252
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,837
...and you planned
this whole thing together.

1253
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:52,088
Planned what?

1254
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,467
Are you suggesting I arranged
for Swann to come here...

1255
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:56,718
...to blackmail her?

1256
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,261
No.

1257
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,472
To kill her.

1258
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,975
-Kill Margot?
-That's it.

1259
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:04,809
Why?

1260
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,770
Because she said so.

1261
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:11,274
"He came from behind the curtain...

1262
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:14,903
...and he tried to strangle me."
Okay, that's what he did.

1263
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,988
All you gotta do is
support everything she said.

1264
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,823
Don't you see? That's my whole idea.

1265
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,450
What about your letter?

1266
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:23,286
A man doesn't kill the person
he's blackmailing. Doesn't make sense.

1267
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:27,457
Yes, I know. That worried me
for a while too, but I've got that licked.

1268
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:28,333
You tell them...

1269
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,544
...that you stole her handbag yourself.

1270
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:32,671
Why should I do that?

1271
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,841
Because you wanted to read my letter.

1272
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,719
When you had read it, you got mad
and decided to teach her a lesson.

1273
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,471
So you wrote those blackmail notes.

1274
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,056
Nobody can prove you didn't.

1275
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:46,309
You can also say you never saw Swann
at Victoria Station.

1276
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:49,271
You just invented that
to try to connect him with my letter.

1277
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,106
Don't you see how it all hangs together?

1278
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,942
But your letter was found in his pocket.

1279
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,361
-Well, you put it there.
-When?

1280
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,989
Sometime before the police arrived.

1281
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,660
And you could have also...

1282
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,246
...planted the stockings...

1283
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:07,205
...at the same time.

1284
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,541
But, Mark, why should I want anyone
to kill Margot?

1285
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,710
I know, Tony.

1286
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,338
It's tough for us to see
because we both love her...

1287
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,091
...but we need a reason now.

1288
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:20,093
We need it badly.

1289
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:26,474
Let's take one of the old stock motives.
Had Margot made a will?

1290
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,020
-Yes, I believe she had.
-Who was the beneficiary?

1291
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,479
Why, I am, I suppose.

1292
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,731
There's your reason, Tony.

1293
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,275
Thousands of husbands and wives
leave money to each other...

1294
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:38,111
...without murdering each other.
The police wouldn't believe it.

1295
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:39,696
They'd take it for what it is:

1296
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:42,365
A man trying desperately
to save his wife.

1297
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,868
Well, I certainly think it's worth that try.

1298
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:48,038
Let's face it. They can't hang you
for a murder that never came off.

1299
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,748
You'd get a few years in prison.

1300
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,625
Thanks very much.

1301
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:55,253
It's a small price to pay.
You'd be saving her life.

1302
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,881
That's fine coming from you, Mark.

1303
01:17:58,049 --> 01:18:00,884
Her life wouldn't be in danger at all
if it hadn't been for you.

1304
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:05,638
It's because of her association with you
that she lost the sympathy of the jury.

1305
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,434
Don't get me wrong, Mark.

1306
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:12,228
If there was the slightest chance
of this coming off, I'd do it...

1307
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,898
...but it's got to be convincing.

1308
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:18,234
For instance, how could I possibly have
persuaded Swann to do a thing like this?

1309
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,111
Well, you offered him money...

1310
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:22,113
-...or something.
-Money? I don't have any.

1311
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,573
Yes, you'd have had Margot's.

1312
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,326
It'd be months
before I get my hands on that...

1313
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,912
...and people don't commit murder
on credit.

1314
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:30,789
No, I'm....

1315
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:34,125
I'm afraid you'll have to think
of something better than that.

1316
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:36,878
I know you're trying to help...

1317
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,964
...but can you imagine anyone
believing a story like that?

1318
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,134
Yes, I can, if you make them believe it.

1319
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,012
I wouldn't know what to say.
You'd have to come with me.

1320
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,514
Tony, that'd really be a mistake.

1321
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,809
They know the kind of stuff I write.
We wouldn't stand a chance there--

[DOORBELL BUZZES]

1324
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:01,444
TONY:
Oh, hello, inspector.

1325
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,161
Is it about my wife?

1326
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,748
-No, sir, I'm afraid not.
-Then what is it?

1327
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,210
Well, I'm making inquiries
in connection with a robbery...

1328
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:19,546
...that took place
about three weeks ago, sir.

1329
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,673
Well, can't it wait a few days?

1330
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:24,717
Of course, sir.
I'm very conscious of your position.

1331
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,345
If I may, I'd like to say
how deeply sorry I am--

1332
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,265
Yes, inspector, yes, all right.
Now, how can I help you?

1333
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:32,851
HUBBARD:
The cashier of a factory in Ledbury Street...

1334
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,310
...was attacked in his office...

1335
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,980
...and two men made off
with several hundred pounds...

1336
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:38,731
...mostly in pound notes.

1337
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,316
TONY:
What is all this to do with me?

1338
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,528
Well, in cases like this, all police divisions
are asked to keep a lookout...

1339
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,905
...for anyone spending
large sums of money.

1340
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,073
I see.

1341
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:52,036
And I was wondering
if you'd sold anything recently for cash.

1342
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:52,871
Why?

1343
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:57,876
Well, my sergeant happened to be making
inquiries at Wales' Garage the other day...

1344
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:02,005
...and it appears that
you settled an account there recently...

1345
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,632
...for just over £60.

1346
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,968
Yes, I happened to have
quite a bit on me at the time...

1347
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,428
...so I settled for cash.

1348
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:09,804
I see.

1349
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,056
Had you just drawn this money
from your bank?

1350
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,601
Have you been to my bank, inspector?

1351
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:18,771
Yes. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have, yeah.
Yeah, but they wouldn't help me.

1352
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,399
Oh, bank statements are always
jealously guarded.

1353
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,527
Yes, but I'm rather surprised
you didn't come to me first.

1354
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:29,073
It was only a routine matter after all.
I didn't want to disturb you.

1355
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:32,702
Where did you get it, sir?

1356
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:34,662
Is that any of your business?

1357
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,749
Well, if it was stolen money,
yes, sir, it is my business.

1358
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,293
-Do you mind if I smoke?
-Go ahead.

1359
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,962
Do you really think
I've been receiving stolen money?

1360
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,131
Well, until you tell me
where you got it...

1361
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,550
...I shan't know what to think, shall I?
You see...

1362
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,969
...if you got this money
from someone you didn't know...

1363
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,556
...I mean, that might be
the very person we're looking for.

1364
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:55,225
Hello.

1365
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,937
-Is this yours, sir?
-What is it?

1366
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,188
Somebody's latchkey.

1367
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,148
It was lying on the floor just here.

1368
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,654
No. Mine's here.

1369
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,538
No. No, it's not yours.
It may be mine then.

1370
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:23,670
Yes. Yes, it is mine. Heh. Yes, it
must have dropped out of the pocket.

1371
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,588
There's a small hole there.

1372
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:29,342
That's the trouble with these latchkeys,
they're all alike.

1373
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,635
I'm sorry, you were saying?

1374
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,721
-I don't think I was, was I?
-Oh, yes, about that money.

1375
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,015
I'd be grateful if you'd tell me
where you got it.

1376
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,935
After all, £100 is quite a lot
to carry around.

1377
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:42,689
-You said 60 a moment ago.
-Did I? Oh, yes.

1378
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:47,277
Yes, my sergeant decided to dig
a little deeper before he put in his report.

1379
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,238
He said that you also paid
a bill at your tailor's...

1380
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:52,115
...and another for wines and spirits.

1381
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:53,992
TONY:
I'm sorry he went to all that trouble.

1382
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,035
Had he come to me,
I could've explained at once.

1383
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:59,247
I simply won rather a large sum
at dog racing.

1384
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,373
Over £100?

1385
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,418
Yes, over £100.
It has been done before, you know.

1386
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:06,421
Yes, well, why didn't you
tell me this straightaway then?

1387
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:09,173
Well, I was rather ashamed
of being caught going to dog racing...

1388
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,593
...when my wife
is under sentence of death.

1389
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,972
Yes, I know how it is.
It helps to take your mind off things.

1390
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,099
Well, that answers everything,
doesn't it?

1391
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,018
I'm sorry to have to bother you
at this time.

1392
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,144
Not at all, inspector.

1393
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,687
Not at all.

1394
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,403
Uh, there's just one other thing, sir.

1395
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:33,531
Have you a small, blue attaché case?

1396
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,992
-Don't say you found it already.
-Why, have you lost it?

1397
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,703
TONY: Yes. I was going to report it
this afternoon. I think...

1398
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,622
-...I left it in a taxi.
HUBBARD: I see.

1399
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:44,751
Well, we-- We must try and get it back,
mustn't we?

1400
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:46,336
Where did you pick the taxi up, sir?

1401
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,838
Uh, Hyde Park Corner
about half an hour ago.

1402
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:49,714
Anything valuable?

1403
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,050
TONY: No, a few books and, uh--
HUBBARD: Any money?

1404
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,135
Two or £3 in an envelope, I believe.

1405
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,303
Not 2- or 300?

1406
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,971
TONY:
No, I'm afraid not.

1407
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,348
HUBBARD:
Just as well.

1408
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:01,392
TONY: Inspector, how did you find out
about the attaché case?

1409
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,187
HUBBARD: The wine shop mentioned
you had it when you paid your bill.

1410
01:23:04,355 --> 01:23:06,856
So my sergeant checked back
on your garage and your tailor.

1411
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:09,442
They both remembered you having it
when you paid them.

1412
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,445
TONY: Yes, I use it instead of a briefcase.
HUBBARD: Mm. Well...

1413
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:15,073
...these taxi men are pretty good
at turning things in.

1414
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,033
I hope you'll find it all right, sir.

1415
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,745
MARK:
Inspector, before you go...

1416
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:25,958
...I think Mr. Wendice
has something to tell you.

1417
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,460
Has he?

1418
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,005
Then I'd like to show you
something in here, sir.

1419
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:44,227
No wonder you couldn't bear
to sleep in her bedroom.

1420
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:47,021
There must be over £500 here.

1421
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,441
Where did you get it?

1422
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,486
Well, I can tell you why he got it.

1423
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,863
This money was to have been paid
to a man named Swann...

1424
01:23:56,031 --> 01:24:00,118
...after he murdered Mrs. Wendice.
But as you know, there was an accident...

1425
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,704
...so it wasn't necessary
to pay Swann after all.

1426
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,707
Obviously, he couldn't produce all this
without questions being asked...

1427
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,333
...so he lived on it.

1428
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,378
He's been living on it
since the 27th of March.

1429
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,046
Well, Mr. Wendice?

1430
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,924
Before you came, inspector,
he was trying to persuade me...

1431
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:19,178
...to go to the police with the
most fantastic story you ever heard.

1432
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:22,849
Apparently, I bribed Swann
to murder my wife so that....

1433
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:24,934
Correct me if I go wrong, Mark.

1434
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:27,437
So that I could inherit all her money.

1435
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:31,649
And that isn't all.
You remember Mr. Halliday's letter?

1436
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,777
Well, apparently,
Swann didn't steal it, I did...

1437
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,029
...and I wrote those two blackmail notes...

1438
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:41,033
...and I kept Mr. Halliday's letter
and planted it on the body.

1439
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,953
-And the stocking--
-Oh, yes, the stocking.

1440
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:46,914
Perhaps I'd better tell this, Mark.
Might sound more like a confession.

1441
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,917
I substituted.... Is that the right word?

1442
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,755
Yes. I substituted my wife's
other stocking for the one that.... Uh--

1443
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,047
You do follow me, don't you?

1444
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:56,716
What else, Mark?

1445
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:58,926
He told Swann...

1446
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,262
...he'd hide his key
somewhere out here...

1447
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,723
...probably up on this ledge.

1448
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:05,933
Swann let himself in.

1449
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:09,395
He hid behind the curtains.
Then Wendice phoned from the hotel.

1450
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:10,980
-That brought her--
-Just one moment.

1451
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,899
If Swann had used Mr. Wendice's key...

1452
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,067
...it would still have been on him
when he died.

1453
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:18,738
Besides, how did Mr. Wendice get in
when he returned from the hotel?

1454
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,364
Well, she could have let him in.

1455
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,409
He could've taken his key from
Swann's pocket before the police got here.

1456
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:27,246
But he let himself in with his own key.
That came out in the trial.

1457
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:28,164
Don't you remember?

1458
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:31,125
Come on, Mark. Your move.

1459
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,796
MARK:
Uh....

1460
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:40,343
Swann could have taken the key
down from here, unlocked the door...

1461
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:42,970
...and then replaced the key on the ledge
before he came in.

1462
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,097
All right. This is very interesting...

1463
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:48,059
...but it isn't getting me any nearer
what I came to find out.

1464
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,770
But this is a question of life and death.
What else matters?

1465
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:53,397
What matters to me is
where Mr. Wendice got this money.

1466
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:54,941
That's all I want to know.

1467
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:04,992
Just a moment, please, sir.

1468
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,792
Inspector, wait a minute. Look at this.

1469
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,253
The last check he wrote
was on the 26th of March...

1470
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,339
...the day before this all happened.
He's been living off it ever since.

1471
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,634
-There's his bank--
-Mr. Halliday.

1472
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,219
Sorry.

1473
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:30,059
He hasn't drawn any large sums
from his bank. Nothing over £53.

1474
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:35,815
But look, inspector,
practically every week.

1475
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:37,441
Thirty-five pounds, 40...

1476
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,151
...£45, 50.

1477
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:40,486

All right, you asked for it.

1483
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:54,333
When she called me back
from the party that night...

1484
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,254
...I found her kneeling beside Swann's
body, going through his pockets.

1485
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:02,091
She kept saying he had something of hers,
but she couldn't find it.

1486
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:05,720
She was almost hysterical. That's why
I wouldn't let the police question her.

1487
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:09,432
In the state she was in, she would
have told every lie under the sun.

1488
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,686
The next morning she showed me
the money just as it is now, all in £1 notes.

1489
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:18,232
And she said, "If anything happens to me,
don't let them find this."

1490
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:22,278
Well, after she was arrested,
I took the money in that case...

1491
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:25,364
...to Charing Cross Station
and left it in the checkroom.

1492
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:29,827
Whenever I needed money, I took it out
and left it in some other checkroom.

she wouldn't stand a chance.

give it to him when she killed him instead.

why didn't Wendice use it just now?

1649
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:40,682

he doesn't realize it's there.

1650
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:45,187

You see, you were very nearly right.

1651
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:47,564
He told Swann that he would leave
your latchkey...

1652

...under the stair carpet, Mrs. Wendice...

1653
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:53,445
...and told him to return it
to the same place when he left.

1654
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:55,781
But as Swann was killed,
we naturally assumed...

1655
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:58,950
...that your key would still be
in one of Swann's pockets. Heh.

1656
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:00,827
That was his little mistake...

1657
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:04,414
...because Swann had done
exactly as you suggested, Mr. Halliday.

1658
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:06,792
He unlocked the door...

1659
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:10,629

before he came in.

Swann's own latchkey.

1664
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:26,395
Mind you, even I didn't guess that at once.
Extraordinary.

1665
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:30,482
You know, it had always puzzled me
that no key was found on Swann's body.

1666

with them.

01:40:38,825 --> 01:40:43,078
...to his girlfriend's, Mrs. Van Dorn's,
and unlocked the door of her flat...

1670
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:47,165
...and then I borrowed her telephone
and called Scotland Yard.

have left that key outside.

Sooner or later, he'll come back here.

01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:46,600

he'll try the one in the handbag.
