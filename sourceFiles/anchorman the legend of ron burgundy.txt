1
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,536
There was a time,
a time before cable,

2
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,406
when the local anchorman
reigned supreme,

3
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:02,321
when people believed
everything they heard on TV.

4
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:06,452
This was an age when only men
were allowed to read the news.

5
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:12,932
And in San Diego, one anchorman
was more man than the rest.

6
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:15,106
His name was Ron Burgundy.

7
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,238
He was like a god
walking amongst mere mortals.

8
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:24,674
He had a voice that could
make a wolverine purr,

9
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:27,632
and suits so fine

10
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:30,067
they made Sinatra
look like a hobo.

11
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,112
In other words,
Ron Burgundy was the balls.

12
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,591
Mmm. I look good.

13
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:43,549
I mean, really good.

14
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:48,289
Hey, everyone!
Come and see how good I look!

15
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,945
Mm, ehh, mm.

16
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,554
Ribs. I had ribs for lunch.
That's why I'm doing this.

17
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:07,208
How now brown cow.
How now brown cow.

18
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,773
How now brown cow.

19
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:12,340
How are you?
You look awfully nice tonight. Hmm?

20
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,558
Maybe don't wear
a bra next time.

21
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,080
No, I was talking to you.
No, not her.

22
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:22,516
I don't know her name.
What is it?

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,647
Lanolin?

24
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:28,909
La-lanolin?
Like sheep's wool?

25
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,996
Unique New York.

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,910
Unique New York.

27
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,911
Mm, I love Scotch.

28
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,347
I love Scotch.
Scotchy, Scotch, Scotch.

29
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:39,912
Here it goes down.

30
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:42,348
Down into my belly.
Mm-mm-mm.

31
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,651
The arsonist
has oddly shaped feet.

32
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:48,653
How much time?
30? 30 seconds?

33
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:51,915
- You are on.
- I'm on right now?

34
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,785
I don't believe you.

35
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:56,742
- # Doo doo doo. #
- Ron!

36
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,873
Oh, come on. Audrey.

37
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,656
I look like hell.
I got bags under my eyes.

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,787
What's that?
If you were a man,

39
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:05,745
I'd punch you right
in the mouth.

40
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:07,701
That's bush.
Bush league.

41
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:11,050
The human torch was denied
a bank loan.

42
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:14,790
You hear me?
Audrey, look at me!

43
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,269
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,052
All right?
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:21,401
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha ho!

46
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:23,054
Ha ha ho.

47
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:25,141
Ha oh!

48
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,925
All right, we're on.

49
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,926
Ready, Phil.

50
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:33,013
We're on in five, four...

51
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,927
When the clock struck 6:00,

52
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:37,927
it meant one thing
for Ron Burgundy

53
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,363
and his news team:
Go time.

54
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:40,537
Channel 4 News,

55
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:42,624
Channel 4 News,

56
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:45,451
with five-time
Emmy award-winning anchor

57
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:47,235
Ron Burgundy.

58
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:49,017
Champ Kind, sports.

59
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:51,104
Ooh! Hoo-hoo!

60
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,975
Brick Tamland, weather.

61
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:59,020
And your reporter in the field,
Brian Fantana.

62
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:05,324
It's Channel 4 News
at 6:00.

63
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:10,806
Good evening.
I'm Ron Burgundy,

64
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:13,197
and this is what's happening
in your world tonight.

65
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,676
A La Jolla man clings to life
at a university hospital

66
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,025
after being viciously attacked
by a pack of wild dogs

67
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:21,852
in an abandoned pool.

68
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:26,463
Hey, everybody! Shut the hell up!
Ron Burgundy's on!

69
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:29,375
Authorities are still
uncertain as to why the man

70
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:31,985
- was loitering...
- Ron Burgundy.

71
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:34,115
Oh, my gosh!
She said her first words!

72
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:37,073
Right now it's 82'
in our fair city,

73
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:41,032
and compare that to 48'
in the upper Northwest

74
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:44,031
and 38'
in the Middle East.

75
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:46,423
Off the coast
of Tampa Bay yesterday,

76
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,859
one lucky cameraman
happened to catch

77
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:51,468
an unusual
aquatic daredevil.

78
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:55,165
What you're about to see
is a Channel 4 News exclusive.

79
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:57,991
His name is
Nutty the Squirrel,

80
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,124
and he's three years old.

81
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:03,514
How 'bout that?

82
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:07,343
That squirrel
can water-ski.

83
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,909
- Man, that's hilarious.
- Yeah, that's good.

84
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:14,605
For all of us here
at News Center 4,

85
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,127
I'm Ron Burgundy.

86
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:18,040
You stay classy,
San Diego.

87
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,519
You stay classy, San Diego.

88
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,608
Listen up.
The ratings just came in for last month.

89
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,827
We are number one.
We just grabbed every key demographic.

90
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,001
- Super-duper, gang!
- Yeah! Yeah!

91
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:33,089
Super-duper!
That's nice!

92
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,740
Way to go!
Neat-o, gang.

93
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,436
- Yes!
- Boy, Ed.

94
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,655
That is good news.
I gotta be honest.

95
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:41,394
- Congrats, congrats.
- That is good news!

96
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:43,135
- All right!
- Stick around.

97
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,353
Make sure these guys
don't party too much.

98
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:48,092
- They don't really ever listen to me.
- Just get it done.

99
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:48,223
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

100
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:52,093
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

101
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:54,441
I've just been handed
an urgent

102
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,443
and horrifying news story.

103
00:05:57,486 --> 00:06:00,443
I need all of you
to stop what you're doing

104
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,922
and listen.

105
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:04,140
Cannonball!

106
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:11,011
Yes, these fellas were a real news team.

107
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,751
Burgundy, of course,
was the foundation, the rock.

108
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:18,926
But each member brought their own
special something to the equation.

109
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:21,101
People call me
the Bri-man.

110
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:23,537
I'm the stylish one
of the group.

111
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,624
I know what
you're asking yourself,

112
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:28,886
and the answer is yes,
I have a nickname for my penis.

113
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,929
It's called the Octagon.

114
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,931
But I also nicknamed
my testes.

115
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,930
My left one
is James Westfall,

116
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,540
and my right one is
Dr. Kenneth Noisewater.

117
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:41,280
You ladies play your cards right,
you might get to meet the whole gang.

118
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:43,541
Bang, boom, they were
showing lasers

119
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,976
every Friday night.

120
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,456
Champ here.
I'm all about havin' fun.

121
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,327
You know, get a couple
of cocktails in me,

122
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,414
start a fire
in someone's kitchen.

123
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,936
Maybe go to SeaWorld,
take my pants off.

124
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,981
Anyway, I've become
kind of famous

125
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:01,981
for my signature catchphrase,
"Whammy!"

126
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:05,286
As in, "Gene Tenace
at the plate...

127
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,243
and whammy!"

128
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,375
Whammy!

129
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:18,246
I'm Brick Tamland.

130
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:20,813
People seem to like me
because I am polite

131
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:22,726
and I'm rarely late.

132
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,725
I like to eat ice cream,

133
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:27,945
and I really enjoy
a nice pair of slacks.

134
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:30,249
Years later,
a doctor will tell me

135
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,033
that I have an lQ of 48

136
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:35,163
and am what some people call

137
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,208
"mentally retarded."

138
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,817
Hello!

139
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:41,470
- Whoo! Marco!
- Polo!

140
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:44,818
- Brian.
- You having a good time?

141
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:47,211
- I'm having a great time.
- That makes two of us.

142
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:48,993
You've gotta meet this girl.

143
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:52,168
She used to be a Charger cheerleader,
but she broke her pelvis.

144
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,517
Sherri,
meet Ron Burgundy.

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,691
- Hey, Ron.
- Hello.

146
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,997
- I've got a big story for you.
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,866
And it's right here.

148
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,953
Well, hello.

149
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,738
You pointed to your boobies.

150
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,868
Oh, my God, you did!

151
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:13,043
- Ron Burgundy?
- Yes?

152
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:16,523
I have had a crush on you
since I was a little girl.

153
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,175
Let's go somewhere.

154
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,351
I'm telling you, it don't
get no better than this.

155
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:24,090
We've been coming
to the same party for 12 years,

156
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:26,221
and in no way
is that depressing.

157
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:30,919
Ahh.

158
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,092
# Gonna make
our own lightning #

159
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:36,571
# Yeah, she got the way
to move me, Cherry #

160
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:38,658
# She got the way
to groove me #

161
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:39,920
# Cherry, baby #

162
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,572
# She got the way
to move me #

163
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,748
# She got the way
to groove me... #

164
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:50,401
By the beard of Zeus!

165
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,880
Excuse me.

166
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:01,926
Ron, where you going?
What, are you crazy? Ron!

167
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:05,839
If you're coming down the baseline,
you gotta take home plate from me!

168
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:09,363
So there I go,
head first, boom!

169
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,885
I've lost her.

170
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:26,714
Ohh.

171
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,543
Hello.

172
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,630
Hello.

173
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,197
Hope I'm not disturbing
you, but, uh,

174
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,197
I saw you from across
the party, and, uh,

175
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:47,851
I don't usually do this, but I felt
compelled to tell you something.

176
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:51,852
You have...

177
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:54,375
an absolutely
breathtaking...

178
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:56,505
heinie.

179
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:59,202
I mean, that thing is good.

180
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:01,463
I want to be friends with it.

181
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,812
Well, you certainly know
how to compliment a woman.

182
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,856
Now, if you'll excuse me.

183
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,074
Do you know who I am?

184
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:13,857
No, I can't say that I do.

185
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:17,816
I don't know how to put this,

186
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:20,989
but I'm kind of a big deal.

187
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,512
Really?

188
00:10:22,512 --> 00:10:24,643
People know me.

189
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:26,686
I've very happy for you.

190
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,210
I'm very important.

191
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,079
I have...

192
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,298
many leather-bound books,

193
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,732
and my apartment

194
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,212
smells of rich mahogany.

195
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:41,256
That's stupid.

196
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:45,778
No, no, that's...
very exciting.

197
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:47,955
Listen, can l--

198
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:50,128
can I start over again?

199
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:52,172
Sure.

200
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:55,217
I wanna say something.
I'm gonna put it out there.

201
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,218
If you like it,
you can take it.

202
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:58,826
If you don't,
send it right back.

203
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,913
Mm-hmm.

204
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:03,001
I wanna be on you.

205
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:07,741
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

206
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:09,873
I--

207
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,656
I wanna be on you.

208
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:31,704
Yoo-hoo!

209
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,748
Baxter!

210
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:35,358
Papa's home.

211
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:37,446
There he is.
There's my little man.

212
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,749
You're okay?

213
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:42,099
Of course I met
a lady tonight.

214
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:46,186
This one was different.
I have to be honest.

215
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:48,752
Quite different.

216
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:51,449
What--

217
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,753
I'm lonely?
I'm not lonely!

218
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,276
I'm beloved by everyone
in San Diego.

219
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,452
Wow.

220
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:06,410
You know how to cut
to the core of me, Baxter.

221
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:09,193
You're so wise.

222
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:13,107
You're like
a miniature Buddha

223
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,890
covered in hair.

224
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,063
Come again?

225
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,934
You know I don't speak Spanish.
In English, please.

226
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:24,066
Huh?

227
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:26,893
You pooped in the refrigerator?

228
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:30,937
And you ate a whole wheel of cheese?

229
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:32,850
How'd you do that?

230
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,330
I'm not even mad.
That's amazing.

231
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:38,939
I forgive you.

232
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:41,679
What do you say we get you
in your pj's and hit the hay?

233
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:45,594
Bedtime. Okay, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

234
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:02,902
Oh, that was one
crazy party.

235
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,685
I am hung over.

236
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,208
I woke up this morning

237
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,168
All right, guys.
Let's focus up.

238
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:23,690
Morning, everyone.

239
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,473
Here are the stories
we're going to be chasing today.

240
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:28,213
It looks like Ling Wong,

241
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:31,127
the rare panda
at the San Diego Zoo, is pregnant.

242
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:32,824
This is a big one.

243
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:35,650
This could be the big
story of the summer.

244
00:13:35,694 --> 00:13:38,564
Network is gonna be wanting
plenty of coverage.

245
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:41,303
And speaking of network,
word on the street is

246
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:43,348
they're looking
for a new anchor.

247
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,349
- So, Ron...
- Huh? Network?

248
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:47,436
Are they here?

249
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,742
A lot of you have been hearing
the affiliates complaining

250
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,613
about a lack of diversity
on the news team.

251
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:06,223
What in the hell's diversity?

252
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,572
Well, I could be wrong,

253
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:12,137
but I believe diversity
is an old, old wooden ship

254
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:15,487
that was used
during the Civil War era.

255
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:18,227
I would be surprised
if the affiliates were concerned

256
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,401
about the lack
of an old wooden ship,

257
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:22,706
but nice try.

258
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,403
Diversity means
that times are changing,

259
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,621
and with that in mind--

260
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:30,622
- Ron, are you paying attention?
- Nope.

261
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,796
- This concerns all of us.
- Okay.

262
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,579
Keeping that in mind, I'd like
to introduce the latest addition

263
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,754
to the KVWN News Team,

264
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:41,494
directly from WYPN

265
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:44,712
in Asheville, North Carolina,

266
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:47,757
Ms. Veronica Corningstone.

267
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,756
- # Who's that lady? #
- Hello.

268
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,235
- # Who's that lady... #
- Hello, everyone.

269
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,714
- Oh!
- I just want you all to know

270
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:57,976
that I look forward
to contributing

271
00:14:57,976 --> 00:15:01,151
to this news station's
already sterling reputation.

272
00:15:03,848 --> 00:15:06,152
I mean, come on, Ed!
It's bullcrap!

273
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,588
Don't get me wrong.
I love the ladies.

274
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:12,023
They rev my engine,
but they don't belong in the newsroom!

275
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:15,372
It is anchorman,
not anchorlady!

276
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,982
- And that is a scientific fact!
- Uh-huh.

277
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:22,157
I don't know
what we're yelling about!

278
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:25,070
Ron, what do you think?

279
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,157
She-- sh--
it's terrible!

280
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:30,072
She has beautiful eyes,
and her hair smells like cinnamon!

281
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:31,419
Mm-hmm.

282
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,508
Loud noises!

283
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:38,118
All right, everyone relax.
She's not gonna take anyone's airtime.

284
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:41,727
I read somewhere that
their periods attract bears.

285
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,510
Bears can smell
the menstruation.

286
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:48,120
Well, that's just great.
You hear that, Ed?

287
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:51,077
Bears. Now you're putting
the whole station in jeopardy.

288
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:53,643
I will say
one thing for her, Ed,

289
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,819
she does have a nice,
big old behind.

290
00:15:56,862 --> 00:16:00,035
I'd like to put some
barbecue sauce on that butt

291
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,688
and just bite, bite, bite, bite,
munch, munch, munch!

292
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,298
- Ah-whoo!
- Stop it! Oh, Jeez.

293
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:11,474
Look at the full-moon butt!

294
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:13,605
Champ! Champ!
Champ, Champ!

295
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:17,171
Mr. Harken, I was just wondering

296
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:19,214
if you knew when my office
would be ready.

297
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:21,303
Well, that might
take some time.

298
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:24,521
For now, why don't you just
grab a desk in the bullpen?

299
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:27,695
You can use my office! Then afterwards
maybe we can go to lunch!

300
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,566
Lower your voice, Ron.

301
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,567
Mm-hmm!

302
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,654
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Harken.

303
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:38,568
I'll go get
my desk set up.

304
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,136
Oh, she is a saucy mama!
I mean, I would...

305
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:53,311
Here we go again.

306
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:55,398
Every station
it's the same.

307
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:57,963
Women ask me
how I put up with it.

308
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:00,573
Well, the truth is,
I don't really have a choice.

309
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:02,574
This is definitely
a man's world.

310
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:04,792
But while they're laughing
and grab-assing,

311
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:06,488
I'm chasing down leads

312
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:09,229
and practicing
my nonregional diction.

313
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:12,229
Because the only way to win
is to be the best.

314
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:14,360
The very best.

315
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,013
Touchy situation.

316
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:22,492
I think the best thing
to do with this Corningstone,

317
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:25,102
to keep her in line,
is bed her quick.

318
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,581
Oh, that behind
is driving me loco!

319
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,061
I'm like a night wolf.

320
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:33,582
Guys, take it easy.
Just take it easy!

321
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:37,149
- She's got feelings, too.
- Oh, my God!

322
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,757
Listen to Burgundy.

323
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,803
He's gone soft on us,
like some schoolboy bitch.

324
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:43,932
You sound like a gay.

325
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,848
Hey! Come on!

326
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,674
It's me, Papa Burgundy,
all right?

327
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:54,284
As far as I'm concerned,
Corningstone's fair game.

328
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:57,023
Huh?
Let the games begin!

329
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,199
Hi-ohhh!

330
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:01,677
There he is.
There he is.

331
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:03,764
I'm very aroused.

332
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,157
What's this?

333
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:12,549
Well, well, well.

334
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,291
Ron Burgundy and the Channel 4
News Team.

335
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:20,421
Hello, Wes Mantooth.

336
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,290
Hello,
Evening News Team.

337
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,814
Nice clothes, gentlemen.

338
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:26,509
I didn't know the Salvation Army
was having a sale.

339
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,163
Am I right?
Look at these guys.

340
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:37,033
Hey, where did you
get those clothes?

341
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:39,165
At the toilet store?

342
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:44,862
What are you doing
on our station's turf, Burgundy?

343
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:47,341
You're about to get
a serious beat-down.

344
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:50,820
I will smash your face
into a car windshield

345
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,038
and then take your mother,
Dorothy Mantooth,

346
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:57,561
out for a nice seafood dinner
and never call her again!

347
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,431
Dorothy Mantooth is a saint!
You understand me?

348
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,997
- Dorothy Mantooth is a saint!
- Hey.

349
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,693
Leave the mothers
out of this, all right?

350
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,260
It's unnecessary.

351
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:14,565
Besides, I'm sure Wes here

352
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:19,089
is just upset over finishing
second in the ratings again.

353
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,916
Ooh!

354
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,438
That's completely
uncalled for, Burgundy.

355
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,569
You know those
rating systems are flawed.

356
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,831
They don't take into account
houses that have

357
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:31,439
more than two television sets
and other things of that nature.

358
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:34,789
I guess I have to take you
at your word,

359
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,919
Number Two.

360
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,790
You have
a great day, fellas.

361
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,921
We'll see you around the bend.

362
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:48,531
Son of a bitch!

363
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:51,705
Excusez-moi, Numero Two.

364
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:56,403
Hey, Burgundy.

365
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:58,926
You know those sample audiences
aren't big enough!

366
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:02,447
Stop hiding behind those phony numbers,
Burgundy! I'm coming after you!

367
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:07,100
I hate you, Ron Burgundy.
I hate you!

368
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:10,276
You can't say one word?

369
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,450
Even the guy who can't
think says something!

370
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:15,103
You guys just stand
there? Come on!

371
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:20,453
Right, but I think my son
is just going through a phase.

372
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,323
I have no idea where

373
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:26,150
he would have gotten ahold
of German pornography.

374
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:28,281
But you and l
are mature adults.

375
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:31,672
We've both seen our share
of pornographic materials.

376
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:33,195
Oh, you never have?

377
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,934
Of course you haven't,
how stupid of me. Neither have l.

378
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:38,240
I was just speaking
in generalities.

379
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:42,676
I'll stop by the school
a little later, Sister Margaret. Bye.

380
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,677
Ed, she insisted
on coming in.

381
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,330
Mr. Harken, sir,

382
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,329
I will not have my first story
at this news station

383
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,331
be about a cat fashion show.

384
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:54,983
Miss Corningstone, ma'am,

385
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:58,202
you will do the stories
to which you are assigned.

386
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:01,115
Mr. Harken, I am
a damn good journalist,

387
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,334
and this cat show thing
is grade-A baloney.

388
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:07,378
It is not baloney.
Now, go do your job, missy!

389
00:21:07,422 --> 00:21:09,639
It is baloney!

390
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,511
Hey, Ron,

391
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,904
I'm gonna take a run
at the new girl.

392
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,033
Let the games begin.

393
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:24,164
Oh, Champ, Champ,
we're not really gonna actually do that.

394
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,426
- We were just flapping our gums.
- Oh, yeah.

395
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,558
You kill me, Burgundy.

396
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:32,907
Let me just grab this.
Oh, sorry about that.

397
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:35,125
- Whammy.
- Hmm.

398
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,473
- Uh, Champ?
- Yeah.

399
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:40,083
You're trying to touch
my breasts, aren't you?

400
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,866
What can I say?
I like the way you're put together.

401
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,519
What do you say
we go out on a date?

402
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:49,042
Have some chicken,
maybe some sex.

403
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:50,737
You know,
see what happens?

404
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:53,651
Oh, let me get this
over here.

405
00:21:55,174 --> 00:21:57,044
Sorry.

406
00:21:57,044 --> 00:21:59,392
Oh, there it is.

407
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:01,609
I'll give this
little cookie an hour

408
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,741
before we're doing
the no-pants dance.

409
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,046
Time to musk up.

410
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,307
Wow.

411
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:13,179
It never ceases to amaze me.

412
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:15,396
What cologne
you gonna go with?

413
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,048
London Gentleman, or--

414
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:20,224
wait. No, no, no.
Hold on.

415
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,919
Blackbeard's Delight.

416
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,703
No, she gets
a special cologne.

417
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,660
It's called Sex Panther
by Odeon.

418
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:32,662
It's illegal in nine countries.

419
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:35,184
Yep, it's made with bits
of real panther.

420
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:38,011
- So you know it's good.
- It's quite pungent.

421
00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:39,359
Oh yeah.

422
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,403
It's a formidable scent.

423
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:44,491
It stings the nostrils.

424
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:46,448
- In a good way.
- Yep.

425
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,275
I'll be honest with you.
That smells like pure gasoline.

426
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:51,710
They've done studies,
you know.

427
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:55,537
60% of the time,
it works every time.

428
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:57,537
That doesn't make sense.

429
00:22:57,537 --> 00:22:59,972
Well...

430
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:02,408
Iet's go see if we can
make this little kitty purr.

431
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:11,106
Hey, sweet cheeks. Got an invite
I'd like to extend your way.

432
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,586
My God.

433
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,587
What is that smell?

434
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:19,890
-Oh!

435
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,066
That's the smell
of desire, milady.

436
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,197
God, no, it smells like--

437
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:27,545
Iike a used diaper
filled with lndian food.

438
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,589
Oh!
Excuse me.

439
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:31,590
Desire smells like that
to some people.

440
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,417
What is that? Smells like a turd
covered in burnt hair!

441
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,984
It smells like
Bigfoot's dick!

442
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:46,116
Oh, hell, that's rank!

443
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:50,464
Oh, what's that smell?

444
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:58,032
This is worse than the time
the raccoon got in the copier.

445
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,554
Yeah.

446
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:01,206
It's very distracting.

447
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,077
- When we get to the pet shop--
- Cough!

448
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,729
Look over here.

449
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:07,642
Excuse me, Veronica.

450
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:10,340
Yes, what is it, Brick?

451
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:12,383
I would like
to extend to you

452
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:14,557
an invitation
to the pants party.

453
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:16,906
Excuse me?

454
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:19,689
The party.
The pants--

455
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:22,560
With the pants.
Party with pants?

456
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:24,038
Brick, are you saying

457
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:26,560
that there's a party in
your pants and I'm invited?

458
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:28,214
That's it.

459
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:31,128
Hmm. Did Brian tell you
to say this, Brick?

460
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,086
No--
yes, he did.

461
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:37,738
Okay. No, I don't want to go
to a party in your pants.

462
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:39,478
Very well.
Ian?

463
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,477
Would you like to go
to a party in my pants?

464
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:43,392
No, Brick.

465
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:45,479
All right. Let's go!

466
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:51,654
All right, now...

467
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:54,830
I'm telling you,
she is a real ball-buster.

468
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:56,961
A real ice queen.

469
00:24:57,004 --> 00:25:00,309
Mm. I just
burned my tongue.

470
00:25:00,352 --> 00:25:02,614
The only way
to bag a classy lady

471
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:05,484
is to give her two tickets
to the gun show...

472
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:10,616
and see if she likes
the goods.

473
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,705
1,001.

474
00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:18,662
1,002.

475
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:20,880
- Uh, Mr. Burgundy?
- 1,003.

476
00:25:20,924 --> 00:25:23,228
Helen said that you
needed to see me?

477
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,663
Oh, Miss Corningstone.

478
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:27,708
I wasn't expecting company.

479
00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:33,101
Just doing my workout.

480
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:35,101
Tuesday's arms and back.

481
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:38,319
- You asked me to come by, sir.
- Oh, did l?

482
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:40,450
Yes.

483
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:43,929
Oh, it's the deep burn!

484
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:47,061
Oh, it's so deep.

485
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:50,106
I can barely lift my right
arm 'cause I did so many.

486
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:53,759
I don't know if you heard me counting.
I did over 1,000.

487
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,802
You have your ubulus muscle

488
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:58,628
that connects
to the upper dorsinus.

489
00:25:58,672 --> 00:26:00,934
It's boring,
but it's part of my life.

490
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,804
I'm just gonna grab this shirt,
if you don't mind.

491
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:07,152
Just watch out for the guns.
They'll get you.

492
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:08,936
You are pathetic.

493
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:11,415
This has to be
the feeblest

494
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:14,068
pickup attempt
that I have ever encountered.

495
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,026
I expected it from the rest of them,
Mr. Burgundy, but not from you.

496
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:20,374
Wait a minute!
I-- pickup attempt?

497
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:21,939
I'm offended.

498
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:24,331
I have little time
to get to the gym,

499
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,984
so I have to sculpt
my guns at the office.

500
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,942
Oh, stop calling
your arms "guns."

501
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:31,985
Look.

502
00:26:31,985 --> 00:26:34,160
My plan was to ask you

503
00:26:34,202 --> 00:26:36,812
if I could squire you
about town

504
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:39,510
as one professional
helping another professional,

505
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:42,597
because I know what it's like
to be lonely in a new city.

506
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:47,033
- Really?
- Yes.

507
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:49,642
But now I am too hurt.

508
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:52,339
And shocked and offended

509
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:53,731
and-- and hurt.

510
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:55,644
I could do that.

511
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:56,863
Really?

512
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:58,819
Well, yes.

513
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,819
As a journalist,
I should get to know

514
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,776
the city
that I'm covering.

515
00:27:02,776 --> 00:27:05,734
- But this is not a date.
- No, of course not.

516
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:08,474
- Strictly professional.
- Wonderful.

517
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:10,866
- Hmm.
- Great.

518
00:27:12,692 --> 00:27:14,214
Shall I pick you up

519
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:16,302
8:00?

520
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:19,998
Mm, 9:00.

521
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,564
Downstairs?

522
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:25,565
Mr. Burgundy, you have
a massive erection.

523
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:27,652
Really?

524
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:31,523
Yes, I do.
Um...

525
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,306
I'm sorry, it's the--

526
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,697
- it's the pleats.
- Mm.

527
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,003
It's actually
an optical illusion.

528
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:41,047
It's the pattern
on the pants.

529
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:44,439
It's not flattering
in the crotchal region.

530
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:46,570
I'm actually
taking them back right now.

531
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:49,571
Taking them back
to the pants store.

532
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,876
Oh, this is awkward.

533
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:57,182
and I will see you later.

534
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,098
Don't act like
you're not impressed.

535
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:10,055
Frame up two.

536
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,968
- Let's go to Brian Fantana live...
- Gimme a tighter one on two.

537
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:15,404
...with a Channel 4
News exclusive.

538
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:16,839
Brian?

539
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,144
Panda watch.
The mood is tense.

540
00:28:19,186 --> 00:28:21,841
I have been on some
serious, serious reports,

541
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:23,536
but nothing like this.

542
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,581
I-- l-- Ching--
King is inside now.

543
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:29,625
I tried to get an interview,
but they said, "You can't.

544
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:32,453
He's a live bear. He will
literally rip your face off."

545
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:35,453
Hey! You're making me
look stupid!

546
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:38,367
Get out here!
Panda jerk!

547
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:41,106
Great story.
Compelling and rich.

548
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,369
That's gonna do it for all
of us at Channel 4 News.

549
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:47,672
You stay classy,
San Diego.

550
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,805
I'm Ron Burgundy?

551
00:28:50,892 --> 00:28:54,632
Damn it! Who typed a question mark
on the Teleprompter?

552
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:57,980
For the last time, anything
you put on that prompter,

553
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:00,112
Burgundy will read.

554
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:04,981
Oh, God,
this is a mistake.

555
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:06,895
This is a mistake.

556
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:10,027
He's very cute. Very cute.
No, he's not. He's hairy.

557
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,506
There she is!
Veronica!

558
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,985
My little China doll.

559
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:16,985
I am full of it tonight.

560
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:19,464
Oh, silly. Hi.

561
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,595
You look ravishing.

562
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,596
It truly is beauty
and the beast.

563
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:28,076
I might add
a handsome beast at that.

564
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:29,815
Are you ready
for our rendezvous?

565
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:31,468
It's not a date.

566
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:34,121
No, strictly professional.

567
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,687
Doesn't mean
we can't have fun.

568
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,817
- Shall we?
- Yes.

569
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,168
San Diego.

570
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,168
Mm! Drink it in.

571
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:50,255
It always
goes down smooth.

572
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:54,431
What a beautiful view,
Mr. Burgundy.

573
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:57,778
I know. I love this city.
It's a--

574
00:29:57,822 --> 00:29:59,562
it's a fact.

575
00:29:59,562 --> 00:30:01,824
It's the greatest city
in the history of mankind.

576
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:06,912
Discovered by the Germans
in 1904.

577
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:10,086
They named it San Diago,

578
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,174
which of course in German
means a whale's vagina.

579
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:19,350
N-- no, there's
no way that's correct.

580
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:26,612
I'm sorry.
I was trying to impress you.

581
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,438
Oh.

582
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:31,179
I don't know what it means.

583
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:34,179
I'll be honest. I don't think anyone
knows what it means anymore.

584
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:36,572
Scholars maintain that
the translation was lost

585
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,616
hundreds of years ago.

586
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:41,007
Doesn't it mean
Saint Diego?

587
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:44,922
No. No.

588
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:47,488
No, that's--
that's what it means.

589
00:30:47,532 --> 00:30:48,880
Really.

590
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,402
Well, agree to disagree.

591
00:30:55,794 --> 00:30:57,751
May I take your order?

592
00:30:57,751 --> 00:31:01,100
Yes, I am going to have
three fingers of Glenlivet

593
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:04,014
with a little bit of pepper,
and, uh, some cheese.

594
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:05,971
Very good.

595
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:07,928
A Manhattan,
and kick the vermouth

596
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:10,059
in the side with a pair
of steel-toed boots.

597
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:11,973
- Certainly.
- Thank you, Scott.

598
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:14,016
Thank you.

599
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:16,582
Wow.
Quite a drink order.

600
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,800
Oh, well, when in Rome.

601
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,410
Yes?

602
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,324
Please, go on.

603
00:31:23,324 --> 00:31:26,802
Uh, do as the Romans do?

604
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:28,585
It's an old expression.

605
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:30,803
Oh! I've never heard of it.

606
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:32,630
- Oh.
- It's wonderful, though.

607
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,892
Mr. Burgundy.

608
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,328
- Tino! How are you?
- So good to see you.

609
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:39,023
You're looking fantastic.

610
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,023
Tino, Veronica.

611
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:43,633
Veronica.
What a pretty girlfriend.

612
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:45,677
- Drinks are on Tino tonight.
- No, no, no.

613
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:48,155
We're work associates.
I work at the station.

614
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:51,331
- I'm a journalist.
- Oh, okay. This is a good guy.

615
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,505
Tino's the finest
club owner in the city.

616
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:55,114
- My best friend, right?
- Yes.

617
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,246
Yes, we have a saying
in my country about people like him.

618
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,811
"The coyote of the desert

619
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,073
always likes to eat
the heart of the young,

620
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:06,856
where the blood drips down to children
for breakfast, lunch and dinner,

621
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,683
- only the ribs will be broken in two."
- Tino.

622
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:12,466
Okay. Well, Mr. Burgundy,
we will be honored

623
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,207
if you will play
"yazz" flute for us.

624
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:17,164
- I can't.
- Please.

625
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:19,337
You play jazz flute?

626
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:21,513
- I dabble.
- Oh.

627
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:24,688
Would everyone love to hear
Ron Burgundy play "yazz" flute?

628
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:27,993
- Get it goin', Ronnie!
- Yes! Please.

629
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:29,254
You, on stage now.

630
00:32:29,254 --> 00:32:32,037
Okay, I guess I can play
a little ditty.

631
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:33,820
- Honestly, I'm--
- Come on.

632
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,517
- Give him a hand.
- I'm not prepared. Not at all.

633
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,387
- Yeah!
- This is a surprise, I'll tell you.

634
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:44,432
Guys, "East Harlem
Shakedown," E flat?

635
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:46,084
Keep the cymbals splashy,

636
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:48,215
and, Jay, let's take
the bass line for a walk.

637
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,912
Hold on.

638
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:56,784
I'm not hearing it right.
Hold on.

639
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:06,176
We got it now.
It's all right.

640
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,308
Fire up, Ronnie!

641
00:33:09,961 --> 00:33:13,483
Little "Ham and Eggs" comin' at you.
Hope you got your griddles.

642
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,572
That's baby-makin' music,
that's what that is.

643
00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:31,052
Let's go!

644
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,108
Hey, Aqualung!

645
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:28,720
Thank you.

646
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,808
Thank you!

647
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,810
You were amazing.

648
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,723
Mm. Thank you.

649
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:43,854
Where did you learn
to play like that?

650
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:45,593
Well, jazz flute

651
00:34:45,593 --> 00:34:48,638
has always been a small
passion of mine.

652
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:51,683
So what other passions
do you have, Mr. Burgundy?

653
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:56,466
Well, I have one
great passion that--

654
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,990
that lives deep
within my loins, like a--

655
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:05,033
Iike a flaming golden hawk:

656
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:08,209
To one day
become a network anchor.

657
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:11,341
Well, believe it or not,

658
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:13,428
we share the same dream.

659
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:16,471
I too want to be
an network anchor.

660
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:20,386
God, you are so beautiful.

661
00:35:24,995 --> 00:35:27,083
We really
should be going.

662
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:30,214
I swore that I would never
get involved with a coworker.

663
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,999
Wait.

664
00:35:35,998 --> 00:35:39,000
What if, just for tonight,
we weren't coworkers?

665
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:41,826
We were co-people?

666
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:44,957
- I don't--
- Shh.

667
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:48,306
You be a woman.

668
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,742
I'll be a man.

669
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:52,873
That's all.

670
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:55,090
Oh.

671
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,222
You continue to surprise
me, Mr. Burgundy.

672
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:22,141
Oh, I'm storming your castle
on my steed, milady.

673
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:29,622
Oh, mi corazón
es en fuego!

674
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,927
Julio, fuego,
fuego, fuego!

675
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,275
Wait, stop.
Stop talking like that.

676
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,840
- I can't understand you.
- Sorry.

677
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:43,277
Take me to Pleasure Town!

678
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:45,364
- Oh, we're going there!
- Oh!

679
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:52,584
# Love is like candy
on a shelf #

680
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:58,020
# You want to taste
and help yourself... #

681
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,586
I friggin' love you!

682
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,673
I friggin' love you back!

683
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:05,153
# Help yourself,
take a few #

684
00:37:05,196 --> 00:37:08,023
# That's what
I want you to do... #

685
00:37:08,066 --> 00:37:11,024
Look! The most glorious
rainbow ever!

686
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,851
Oh, do me on it!

687
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:15,938
# Just say the word
and they are yours... #

688
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:19,852
Whee!

689
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:24,811
# In my heart your smile
has opened up the door #

690
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:28,811
# The greatest wealth
that exists in the world. #

691
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:30,899
Mmm.

692
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,986
Well done, sir.

693
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,205
Tip of the cap to you as well,
Miss Corningstone.

694
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:49,469
I'm having very strong feelings
for you, Mr. Burgundy.

695
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:51,079
Mm.

696
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,471
But it's very important to me
that I be viewed as a professional.

697
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,514
- Right.
- Hmm.

698
00:37:56,514 --> 00:37:59,341
When in Rome.

699
00:37:59,384 --> 00:38:00,733
Yeah.

700
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:02,646
That, uh, expression

701
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:05,168
doesn't really apply
to what I'm talking about.

702
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:07,255
- Oh, I'm--
- What I was saying.

703
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:10,257
I still don't quite
understand what it means.

704
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,519
Oh, no.
You'll find it.

705
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,911
No, I was saying that,

706
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:18,998
if we continue
seeing each other,

707
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:22,782
that we should keep it
relatively quiet around the station.

708
00:38:22,826 --> 00:38:24,608
Absolutely,

709
00:38:24,608 --> 00:38:27,262
my wild love tigress.

710
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:32,699
Tasteful discretion
is the name of the game.

711
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:34,828
Mm-hmm.

712
00:38:37,134 --> 00:38:40,135
Veronica Corningstone
and I had sex,

713
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:43,308
and now we are in love!

714
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:46,571
Did I say that loud?

715
00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:48,875
Yeah, you pretty much
yelled it.

716
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:51,007
Well, I can't help it.

717
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:52,572
It's fantastic!

718
00:38:52,572 --> 00:38:55,703
- What's it like, Ron?
- The intimate times?

719
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:58,225
Outta sight, my man!

720
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:03,010
No. The other thing.

721
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:04,619
Love.

722
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,272
Yeah.
What is that?

723
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:11,099
Well, it's tough to explain.

724
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:15,014
- I think I was in love once.
- Really, what was her name?

725
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:16,491
I don't remember.

726
00:39:16,491 --> 00:39:19,449
That's not a good start,
but keep going.

727
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:21,536
She was Brazilian.

728
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:23,972
Or Chinese,
or something weird.

729
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:26,973
I met her in the bathroom
of a K-mart,

730
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,191
and we made out for hours.

731
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:32,627
Then we parted ways,
never to see each other again.

732
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,106
I'm pretty sure
that's not love.

733
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,540
Damn it!

734
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,628
I love...

735
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:42,021
carpet.

736
00:39:43,804 --> 00:39:46,500
I love desk.

737
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:50,370
Are you just looking at things
in the office and saying you love them?

738
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,239
I love lamp.

739
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,981
Do you really love the lamp,
or are you saying it because you saw it?

740
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:59,720
I love lamp!
I love lamp.

741
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,982
You really want to know
what love is?

742
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,286
- Yeah.
- Yes, tell us.

743
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,419
More than anything
in the world.

744
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:10,202
Well, it's really
quite simple.

745
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:13,854
It's kind of like...

746
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:18,508
# Gonna find my baby,
gonna hold her tight #

747
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:21,988
# Gonna grab
some afternoon delight #

748
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,031
# My motto's always been
"When it's right, it's right" #

749
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:28,640
# Why wait until the middle
of a cold, dark night #

750
00:40:28,684 --> 00:40:34,861
# When everything's a little
clearer in the light of day #

751
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:37,209
# And we know the night #

752
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:41,644
# Is always gonna
be there anyway? #

753
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:44,516
# Thinkin' of you's
working up my appetite #

754
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,384
# Lookin' forward
to a little afternoon delight #

755
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:50,386
# Rubbin' sticks and stones together
make the sparks ignite #

756
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,821
# And the thought of lovin' you
is getting so exciting #

757
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,779
# Sky rockets in flight #

758
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:58,693
- # Boo! #
- # Afternoon delight... #

759
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:01,520
- Whoop!
- You guys have it, I think.

760
00:41:01,563 --> 00:41:04,694
# Afternoon delight. #

761
00:41:04,737 --> 00:41:08,696
I don't know, Ron.
That sounds kinda crazy.

762
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:10,914
Sounds like you have
mental problems, man.

763
00:41:10,957 --> 00:41:13,696
- Yeah, you got mental problems, man.
- Yeah, he really does.

764
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:14,915
Man.

765
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:17,741
# Afternoon delight. #

766
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:20,046
- Wanna make a phone call.
- Freshen this up.

767
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:32,180
Oh, look out.
Next up, it's Whiskerus Maximus.

768
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:34,267
He's ready to do battle
in the arena

769
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:37,094
against the tiniest lion
you've ever imagined.

770
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:41,487
I'm getting some great stuff,
Miss Corningstone.

771
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,748
Shut up.

772
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,618
Oh, I hate cats.

773
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:48,227
Let's just do my sign-off
and get outta here.

774
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:52,097
It was quite a show
down here at the Pet Shack.

775
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:56,272
Just for today, fashion curiosity
did not kill the cat.

776
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:59,796
I'm Veronica Corningstone
for Channel 4 News.

777
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,449
That was our newest reporter,
Veronica Corningstone.

778
00:42:03,493 --> 00:42:05,145
She's really great.

779
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:08,363
I'd also like to share with you
that we are currently dating

780
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:11,104
and that she is quite
a handful in the bedroom.

781
00:42:11,148 --> 00:42:12,973
Uh...

782
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:15,627
That's gonna do it
for all of us here at 6:00.

783
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:18,366
For the Channel 4 News Team,
I'm Ron Burgundy.

784
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,497
You stay classy,
San Diego.

785
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:23,497
All clear.

786
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,585
Uh-oh.

787
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,281
I might be in trouble
on that one.

788
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:32,239
I can't believe that you said
that we were dating on the air.

789
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,935
Mmm! Mmm.
That is good fondue.

790
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:39,328
Don't you get it, Ron?
I wanna be an anchor.

791
00:42:39,371 --> 00:42:41,807
That is never gonna happen
if everyone in San Diego

792
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,850
thinks that I'm
your bimbo gal pal.

793
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,852
I don't know what to say.

794
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:48,461
I just--
I got excited.

795
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:52,635
I just wanted to shout it
from on top of a mountain.

796
00:42:52,678 --> 00:42:55,898
But I didn't have a mountain.
I had a newsroom and a camera.

797
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,463
Look.

798
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:59,463
I report the news.
That's what I do.

799
00:42:59,463 --> 00:43:03,856
And today's top story,
in Ron Burgundy's world,

800
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:06,118
read something like this:

801
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:08,597
I love Veronica Corningstone.

802
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:14,816
Oh, Ron.

803
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:21,208
This is nice, gang, sittin' here.

804
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,600
- Oh, yeah.
- Brown baggin' it.

805
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:27,123
The team pancake breakfast is tomorrow
morning at 9:00 instead of 8:00.

806
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,168
Oh! Almost forgot.

807
00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:31,472
I won't be able
to make it, fellas.

808
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:33,864
Veronica and I are trying
this new fad called,

809
00:43:33,908 --> 00:43:35,821
uh, jogging.

810
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,301
I believe it's jogging or yogging.
It might be a soft "J."

811
00:43:39,343 --> 00:43:42,040
I'm not sure,
but apparently you just run

812
00:43:42,084 --> 00:43:44,215
for an extended period
of time.

813
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:46,738
- It's supposed to be wild.
- So Ron's not coming?

814
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,433
No, Ron's coming.

815
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:51,521
It's the pancake breakfast.
We do it every month.

816
00:43:51,564 --> 00:43:53,435
I realize that.

817
00:43:53,435 --> 00:43:57,087
Sometimes you gotta look yourself
in the mirror and say, "When in Rome."

818
00:43:57,131 --> 00:43:59,218
The bottom line is,

819
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:02,306
you've been spending
a lot of time with this lady.

820
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:06,220
You're a member of
the Channel 4 News Team.

821
00:44:06,264 --> 00:44:08,743
- That's a given.
- We need you.

822
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,266
Hell, I need you.

823
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,745
I'm a mess without ya.

824
00:44:15,788 --> 00:44:18,181
I miss you
so damn much.

825
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:20,962
I miss being with you.

826
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:24,616
I miss being near you.
I miss your laugh.

827
00:44:30,141 --> 00:44:32,314
I miss--
I miss your scent.

828
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:34,967
I miss your musk.

829
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:40,054
When this all gets sorted out,

830
00:44:40,098 --> 00:44:43,100
I think you and me should
get an apartment together.

831
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:47,622
Just take it easy, Champ.

832
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:50,102
Why don't you stop talking
for a while?

833
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,319
Maybe sit the next
couple of plays out.

834
00:44:52,363 --> 00:44:53,929
You know what I mean?

835
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:55,930
Yeah, I'm gonna quit
sayin' things

836
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,277
when they crop up
in the ol' skull, huh?

837
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,235
See what it's like
when you're not here?

838
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:04,279
You're our leader.
Look what you're doing to the group.

839
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:06,671
Champ's been a mess.
Brick can't sleep at night.

840
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:08,889
Here's the thing,

841
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:10,760
I don't trust this chick.

842
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,456
We need you around,
and she is just using you.

843
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,673
Everyone, just relax.
All right?

844
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:19,805
Believe me, if there's one thing
Ron Burgundy knows, it's women.

845
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:22,458
I don't know, Ron.

846
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:24,720
Guess what.
I do.

847
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:28,111
I know that one day, Veronica
and I are gonna get married

848
00:45:28,155 --> 00:45:30,546
on top of a mountain.

849
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,678
And there's going
to be flutes playing

850
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:35,591
and trombones and flowers

851
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:38,158
and garlands of fresh herbs.

852
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:42,768
And we will dance
till the sun rises.

853
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:45,595
And then our children
will form a family band.

854
00:45:45,637 --> 00:45:47,638
And we will tour
the countryside,

855
00:45:47,638 --> 00:45:49,726
and you won't be invited!

856
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,337
I'm telling you, this lady has really
crawled into Ron's head.

857
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:03,034
Good.
Good one!

858
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:04,991
Oh, okay.
I understand.

859
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:07,905
You have a nice day,
sir. Bye.

860
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:10,688
Um, I could come back
later, Mr. Harken.

861
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:12,167
No, no, no.

862
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,906
It's just parent stuff.

863
00:46:13,906 --> 00:46:16,559
It seems that our youngest,
Chris, was

864
00:46:16,603 --> 00:46:18,430
on something called acid

865
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,995
and was firing
a bow and arrow into a crowd.

866
00:46:21,038 --> 00:46:23,125
- Mm.
- You know how kids are.

867
00:46:23,169 --> 00:46:25,039
Oh. Right.

868
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:27,736
Anyhoo, what can
I do you for?

869
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,084
Well, Mr. Harken,

870
00:46:29,084 --> 00:46:32,085
I feel like I have proven
myself as a journalist

871
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:34,173
and that I deserve
the opportunity

872
00:46:34,173 --> 00:46:36,304
to take on more
challenging stories.

873
00:46:36,346 --> 00:46:38,478
Well, ask
and you shall receive.

874
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:41,828
Ah, yes, this just
came across my desk.

875
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,262
Here is a story
of a 103-year-old woman

876
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:48,132
who claims to have a recipe
for the world's greatest meat loaf.

877
00:46:48,176 --> 00:46:50,263
Ooh, now that's
a hot lead.

878
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,613
It was very hard for Veronica.

879
00:46:53,655 --> 00:46:56,352
But she was a pro
and hung tough.

880
00:46:56,352 --> 00:46:59,701
But soon, with a simple act
of littering,

881
00:46:59,743 --> 00:47:02,267
everyone's life
would change forever.

882
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,398
# La la la la la. #

883
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:10,965
# Oh, Baxter, you are
my little gentleman #

884
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:13,053
# I'll take you
to foggy London Town #

885
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:14,530
# Because you are what? #

886
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,315
# My little gentleman. #

887
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:20,272
This burrito is delicious,
but it is filling.

888
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:22,621
Whoa!

889
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:26,100
Antony and Cleopatra!

890
00:47:32,752 --> 00:47:35,059
Goddamn son of--

891
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:38,015
What the hell, bro'?

892
00:47:38,015 --> 00:47:40,233
Hello, neighbor.

893
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,495
Did you just throw a burrito
out your window?

894
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:43,756
I believe I did.

895
00:47:43,756 --> 00:47:46,714
Are you high or something?
Did you see what happened?

896
00:47:46,757 --> 00:47:49,540
I did. That was a terrific spill.
That's quite a raspberry.

897
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:52,323
That's my chopper
you just thrashed, Broseph.

898
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:55,890
Easy, compadre. I'm your
friend out here, all right?

899
00:47:55,934 --> 00:47:59,369
I want you to fix my chopper
before I stomp your goofy ass!

900
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:01,457
If you want
to throw down, fine.

901
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:04,848
I've got Jack Johnson
and Tom O'Leary waiting for you.

902
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:07,197
You destroyed
the only thing I love.

903
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,372
All right? There it is.
What do you love?

904
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:12,503
I love poetry.

905
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:14,764
And a glass of Scotch.

906
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,591
And, of course,
my friend Baxter here.

907
00:48:17,635 --> 00:48:20,331
Well, guess what.
Now this is happenin'.

908
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:23,375
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What are you doing?

909
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:28,551
That's how I roll.

910
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:32,595
Baxter!

911
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,422
No...!

912
00:48:38,205 --> 00:48:40,466
- Where the hell is he?
- He'll be here.

913
00:48:42,206 --> 00:48:45,033
- I thought he was Mr. Dependable.
- It's not like Ron.

914
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:48,687
I'd put Brick on, but unless he's
tracking a storm front, he's useless.

915
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,556
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Oh. Hello.

916
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:53,949
Just want you to know if Ron does not
show up, I am ready to go on.

917
00:48:53,992 --> 00:48:56,341
You and I have had this discussion
a million times.

918
00:48:56,384 --> 00:48:58,167
There's never been
a woman anchor.

919
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,645
Mr. Harken,

920
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,646
- this city needs its news.
- Oh.

921
00:49:02,646 --> 00:49:05,778
You're gonna deprive them
of that because I have breasts?

922
00:49:05,822 --> 00:49:07,343
Exquisite breasts?

923
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:11,735
I am gonna go on,
and if you want to stop me, bring it on.

924
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:13,823
Because I am good
at three things:

925
00:49:13,866 --> 00:49:16,172
fighting, screwing
and reading the news.

926
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:19,955
I've already done one of those today,
so what's the other one gonna be?

927
00:49:22,174 --> 00:49:23,521
Uh--

928
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:25,608
Screwing?

929
00:49:28,697 --> 00:49:31,610
I will be in makeup.

930
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:35,177
Jesus, she's terrifying!

931
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,657
Fantana.

932
00:49:39,787 --> 00:49:41,134
Ron, are you okay?

933
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:43,222
The man punted Baxter!

934
00:49:43,222 --> 00:49:45,309
Calm down.

935
00:49:45,353 --> 00:49:47,049
Breathe, Ron,
breathe.

936
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:49,528
The man that loved
the motorcycle!

937
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:51,442
What did the bad man do?

938
00:49:51,442 --> 00:49:55,573
The motorcycle on the bridge!
I hit him with a burrito!

939
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,921
- Ron!
- He took him!

940
00:49:56,921 --> 00:50:00,270
He took him with his foot
and he kicked him!

941
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:01,748
That's what he did!

942
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,098
Someone punted him?

943
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,838
No, wait. Wait.
Let me say something.

944
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:11,229
Let me say something.

945
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:14,274
What?

946
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:20,188
I-- I don't-- I didn't
understand one word you said.

947
00:50:20,232 --> 00:50:22,624
Ron, are you okay?
Ron?

948
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:31,235
Ron.
Where are you?

949
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,932
I'm in a glass case
of emotion!

950
00:50:34,975 --> 00:50:37,063
He's gonna put
Corningstone on.

951
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:39,543
He's gonna
put Corningstone on!

952
00:50:41,586 --> 00:50:43,673
I've got to do the news!

953
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:59,504
You're not Ron.

954
00:51:01,113 --> 00:51:03,809
We're on in 10.
Good luck, lady.

955
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:05,897
Ready the announce.

956
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,941
- Power.
- Roll in.

957
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,073
Power.
Power.

958
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:20,510
One slip,

959
00:51:20,553 --> 00:51:23,031
and you're gone.
Whammy.

960
00:51:23,075 --> 00:51:25,423
And your reporter in the field,

961
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:26,815
Brian Fantana.

962
00:51:26,815 --> 00:51:29,686
It's Channel 4 News
at 6:00.

963
00:51:31,512 --> 00:51:34,078
Good evening.
Ron Burgundy is off tonight.

964
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:37,948
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

965
00:51:37,992 --> 00:51:39,514
Tonight's top story:

966
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,994
- Okay, we're off and running.
- Three armed men

967
00:51:42,038 --> 00:51:45,733
wearing ski masks made off with over
$20,000 from an area bank

968
00:51:45,776 --> 00:51:47,863
in a daring
early morning robbery.

969
00:51:52,865 --> 00:51:54,300
Hey!

970
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,476
And the winner of the frog-leaping
contest was Hoppy,

971
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:00,432
with a jump
of seven feet, 10 inches.

972
00:52:00,476 --> 00:52:02,345
Hmm.

973
00:52:02,345 --> 00:52:06,478
I used to date a guy named Hoppy down
in Alabama. He was quite a jumper, too.

974
00:52:08,522 --> 00:52:10,740
That will do it
for us at 6:00.

975
00:52:10,784 --> 00:52:13,306
From all of us here
at Channel 4 News,

976
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,567
I'm Veronica Corningstone,

977
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,741
and thanks
for stopping by, San Diego.

978
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:20,134
All clear!

979
00:52:20,134 --> 00:52:22,917
Yes! Yes!

980
00:52:24,047 --> 00:52:26,222
Lady! Lady!

981
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:29,136
Not bad, Miss Corningstone.
Not bad at all.

982
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,311
Thank you, Mr. Harken.
That felt good.

983
00:52:31,354 --> 00:52:34,267
- That felt really good.
- I liked your sign-off line, too.

984
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:37,268
You did? It just came through me.
It was so organic.

985
00:52:37,312 --> 00:52:39,400
Thank you.

986
00:52:40,878 --> 00:52:42,879
Oh, Ron! Ron!
Ron, darling!

987
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,574
I'm so glad you're
all right. Oh, God.

988
00:52:45,618 --> 00:52:47,531
I have something
magnificent to tell you.

989
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,967
I'm here.
We can do the news now.

990
00:52:50,011 --> 00:52:52,837
It's all right, everyone!
We can do the news.

991
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,709
Hold on. Why are we all standing around?
Let's go!

992
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:58,840
Ron, we did it.
Veronica filled in for you.

993
00:52:58,883 --> 00:53:00,231
What?

994
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:02,318
Sweetheart, we were
so worried about you,

995
00:53:02,362 --> 00:53:05,189
and we waited as long
as we could, but--

996
00:53:05,233 --> 00:53:09,189
Darling, I did the news,
and I nailed it. I nailed it.

997
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:13,843
Wait, wait! Veronica, please,
tell me this is some kind

998
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:16,366
of sick, tasteless joke.

999
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,713
You weren't here.
Why are you being this way?

1000
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:20,759
Why can't you
be proud of me

1001
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:23,541
as a peer and as
my gentleman lover?

1002
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:25,107
Oh, Jeez.

1003
00:53:25,107 --> 00:53:27,933
I can't believe
you did this to me!

1004
00:53:27,977 --> 00:53:29,978
You read my news!

1005
00:53:29,978 --> 00:53:33,022
I told you that I wanted
to be an anchor.

1006
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:34,633
I told you that.

1007
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:37,067
I thought you were kidding!

1008
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,111
I thought it was a joke!

1009
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:41,415
I even wrote it down
in my diary!

1010
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:44,677
"Veronica had
a very funny joke today."

1011
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,766
I laughed at it
later that night!

1012
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:49,070
I can't believe
that I cared for you.

1013
00:53:49,113 --> 00:53:51,115
Get out! Just go!

1014
00:53:51,115 --> 00:53:53,898
We are through!
Through!

1015
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:56,897
Because of your actions,
you scorpion woman!

1016
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:59,855
You have broken my heart,
Mr. Burgundy.

1017
00:53:59,899 --> 00:54:02,030
You have broken my heart.

1018
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:08,075
From there on out,

1019
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:10,597
things just got worse
for Ron Burgundy.

1020
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:12,728
Corningstone was a star,

1021
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:15,600
and everything started
to move awfully fast

1022
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:18,295
- after her big break.
- Where's lan? Ian!

1023
00:54:18,295 --> 00:54:20,774
All right, I got a call from network.

1024
00:54:20,817 --> 00:54:23,210
It looks like
our broadcast last night

1025
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:26,253
received a two-point
ratings boost,

1026
00:54:26,341 --> 00:54:28,733
and the decision
has been passed down

1027
00:54:28,776 --> 00:54:31,560
to make Veronica
our co-anchor.

1028
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,647
- What?
- No. No!

1029
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:35,734
No!

1030
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:37,517
- No!
- No!

1031
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:38,953
- No!
- This is wonderful.

1032
00:54:38,953 --> 00:54:42,432
Ed, come here,
you big silly man. You big silly man.

1033
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:45,433
- We did it.
- What is this, amateur hour?

1034
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:51,478
- That's great.
- Thank you.

1035
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,478
- # Sunshine, go away today... #
- Damn it!

1036
00:54:53,478 --> 00:54:57,827
# I don't feel much like dancing #

1037
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:01,046
# Some man's gone,
he's trying to run my life #

1038
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:05,221
# Don't know what he's asking #

1039
00:55:07,047 --> 00:55:10,830
# When he tells me
I better get in line #

1040
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:14,484
# I can't hear
what he's sayin' #

1041
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:18,440
# When I grow up
I'm gonna make it mine #

1042
00:55:18,484 --> 00:55:19,659
# These ain't dues... #

1043
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:21,486
What Brian didn't tell you

1044
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:24,486
was that those
were not real pirates.

1045
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,009
- They looked convincing, though.
- Oh, yes.

1046
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:29,618
Well, for all of us here
at Channel 4 News,

1047
00:55:29,662 --> 00:55:31,054
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1048
00:55:31,054 --> 00:55:33,053
You stay classy,
San Diego.

1049
00:55:33,053 --> 00:55:35,097
And thanks
for stopping by.

1050
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:37,143
But mainly stay classy.

1051
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:39,882
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Stay classy, I'm Ron Burgundy.

1052
00:55:39,924 --> 00:55:41,796
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Stay classy.

1053
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,362
Ron Burgundy.

1054
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,797
You are a real hooker,
and I'm gonna slap you in public.

1055
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:58,843
You have man boobs.

1056
00:55:58,886 --> 00:56:01,236
You've got a dirty,
whorish mouth.

1057
00:56:05,585 --> 00:56:07,976
I'm gonna punch you
in the ovary.

1058
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,151
- A straight shot.
- Ooh, ow.

1059
00:56:10,194 --> 00:56:12,238
Right to the baby-maker.

1060
00:56:12,238 --> 00:56:15,326
Ah, jazz flute
is for little fairy boys.

1061
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,457
Okay, you know what?
That's uncalled for.

1062
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,719
I can't work with this woman.
It's terrible.

1063
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:24,329
It's ringing.

1064
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:27,503
Veronica Corningstone.

1065
00:56:27,503 --> 00:56:30,547
Hello, Veronica,
this is Mike Rithjin

1066
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,895
from the network.
You've just been promoted.

1067
00:56:32,939 --> 00:56:35,071
You're gonna need to move
to Moscow.

1068
00:56:35,113 --> 00:56:36,897
Start cleaning up your desk.

1069
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:39,246
See you in the morning.
We'll pick you up in a van.

1070
00:56:39,288 --> 00:56:40,897
What did you say
your name was?

1071
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,116
Mike Ritnitjun.
It's not important.

1072
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:44,681
Start cleaning your desk,

1073
00:56:44,725 --> 00:56:47,160
and we'll pick you up
in the morning.

1074
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,508
Tell her she might
want to get a coat.

1075
00:56:49,508 --> 00:56:52,161
Hold on. Veronica?
What was it?

1076
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:53,727
Tell her to get a coat.

1077
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:56,902
Also, I don't know if you know Moscow.
It's pretty cold.

1078
00:56:56,902 --> 00:56:58,469
You might want
to buy a coat.

1079
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:00,773
Are you and Champ
having a good time, Ron?

1080
00:57:00,816 --> 00:57:01,947
Are we what?

1081
00:57:01,947 --> 00:57:04,077
I can see you, Ron.

1082
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:05,513
What?

1083
00:57:05,513 --> 00:57:08,513
I can see you.

1084
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:10,949
Okay. Bye-bye.

1085
00:57:10,993 --> 00:57:13,081
- What happened?
- She knew it was me.

1086
00:57:16,908 --> 00:57:19,344
You're watching Channel 4 News

1087
00:57:19,344 --> 00:57:21,691
with five-time
Emmy award-winning anchor

1088
00:57:21,735 --> 00:57:23,823
Ron Burgundy
and Tits McGee.

1089
00:57:25,256 --> 00:57:28,128
Good evening, San Diego.
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

1090
00:57:28,171 --> 00:57:30,258
Tits McGee is on vacation.

1091
00:57:33,564 --> 00:57:35,608
And I'm Tits--
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1092
00:57:39,218 --> 00:57:41,740
- Veronica Corningstone.
- This is your doctor.

1093
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,914
I have your pregnancy
report here, and guess what.

1094
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:48,220
You got knocked up.
You should probably get out of news.

1095
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,743
- Who is this?
- This is Dr. Chim.

1096
00:57:50,786 --> 00:57:54,222
- Dr. Chim Richalds.
- Ron, is this you?

1097
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:56,526
I'm a professional doctor.

1098
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:59,091
You saw me.
You don't remember.

1099
00:57:59,136 --> 00:58:02,137
We-- you should move.

1100
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,399
- Get out of the business.
- This is pathetic.

1101
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:06,529
You're pathetic.

1102
00:58:06,572 --> 00:58:08,226
What'd she say?

1103
00:58:08,226 --> 00:58:10,662
She-- I don't--
I think she bought it.

1104
00:58:10,705 --> 00:58:13,141
She's looking this way.

1105
00:58:13,183 --> 00:58:16,314
- Oh, uh-oh. Whoa!
- Here she comes.

1106
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:22,968
I'll tell you what,
it's just not working.

1107
00:58:23,012 --> 00:58:25,404
She's making us look like
a bunch of fools.

1108
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:28,491
Ellen, where's the party?

1109
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,276
Children, grow up.

1110
00:58:33,362 --> 00:58:35,362
Son of a bee sting.

1111
00:58:35,362 --> 00:58:37,494
She's turning
the entire office against us.

1112
00:58:37,537 --> 00:58:40,147
- This is grim. Real grim.
- What are we gonna do?

1113
00:58:40,191 --> 00:58:42,451
There's only one thing
a man can do

1114
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:46,410
when he's suffering from a spiritual
and existential funk.

1115
00:58:46,454 --> 00:58:48,672
Go to the zoo,
flip off the monkeys?

1116
00:58:48,714 --> 00:58:51,324
No. Buy new suits.

1117
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:53,151
Yea!

1118
00:58:53,151 --> 00:58:55,281
# That girl #

1119
00:58:57,543 --> 00:59:00,022
# I'm gonna make her mine
if it takes all night #

1120
00:59:00,065 --> 00:59:01,631
# Can you dig it?
Can you dig it? #

1121
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:03,327
# Can you dig it? Can you dig it? #

1122
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:03,415
Where's the suit store?
We've been walking for 45 minutes.

1123
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:06,457
Where's the suit store?
We've been walking for 45 minutes.

1124
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,937
Brick, I thought you said
this was a shortcut.

1125
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:10,286
Fantastic.

1126
00:59:10,286 --> 00:59:12,764
- Is it a shortcut or not?
- Okay.

1127
00:59:13,895 --> 00:59:15,982
Jeez.

1128
00:59:18,635 --> 00:59:20,461
Hey.

1129
00:59:20,504 --> 00:59:24,114
Uh-oh.
Here comes trouble.

1130
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:29,247
Burgundy and the ladies
went out for a stroll, huh?

1131
00:59:30,725 --> 00:59:33,727
You boys walkin' around
and talkin' things through?

1132
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:35,814
Keep a tight perimeter.

1133
00:59:37,597 --> 00:59:39,684
Yes, sirree.

1134
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,598
Well, well, well.

1135
00:59:43,555 --> 00:59:45,512
Ron Burgundy

1136
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:47,512
and the Channel 4
News Team.

1137
00:59:47,512 --> 00:59:49,513
Where's your mommy?

1138
00:59:49,513 --> 00:59:51,992
You back off,
Evening News Team.

1139
00:59:56,775 --> 00:59:58,993
You know,
I understand that, uh,

1140
00:59:59,037 --> 01:00:01,516
they had to bring
a female in.

1141
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,256
Change your diapers.

1142
01:00:04,256 --> 01:00:06,779
Wipe the dribble away
from your bubblin' lips.

1143
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:10,389
Rub Vaseline
all over your heinie

1144
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:13,694
and tell you that it's special
and different from everyone else's.

1145
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:17,825
He said "heinie"!

1146
01:00:17,869 --> 01:00:19,564
Brick, get back over here!

1147
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:21,042
Heinie!

1148
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:23,130
Does she tuck you in, Ronnie?

1149
01:00:24,174 --> 01:00:26,566
Give you a little kiss
on your forehead?

1150
01:00:26,566 --> 01:00:28,479
Tell you everything's
gonna be okay?

1151
01:00:28,479 --> 01:00:30,740
I've had enough
of you, Mantooth.

1152
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,786
This is gonna end
right here, right now.

1153
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,655
Let's dance, dickweed.

1154
01:00:35,655 --> 01:00:37,742
You wanna dance, Ronnie?

1155
01:00:41,092 --> 01:00:43,180
I wanna polka.

1156
01:00:51,442 --> 01:00:53,921
Come get a taste.

1157
01:00:57,661 --> 01:00:59,706
Brick, where'd you get
a hand grenade?

1158
01:00:59,706 --> 01:01:01,792
I don't know.

1159
01:01:02,706 --> 01:01:05,751
All right.
Let's do this!

1160
01:01:06,968 --> 01:01:09,055
Hey!

1161
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,753
If you're gonna have a fight,

1162
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,145
then don't forget
Channel 2 News with me,

1163
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:18,448
Iead anchor Frank Vitchard.

1164
01:01:18,492 --> 01:01:21,754
You dirtbags have been
in third place for five years.

1165
01:01:21,754 --> 01:01:25,625
Yeah? Well, you're about
to be in dead place.

1166
01:01:31,322 --> 01:01:35,367
Not so fast, you ingrates!

1167
01:01:35,411 --> 01:01:38,498
Public News Team is taking
a break from its pledge drive

1168
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:40,194
to kick some ass.

1169
01:01:40,194 --> 01:01:42,412
No commercials!
No mercy!

1170
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:57,677
Cómo están, pinches!

1171
01:01:57,677 --> 01:01:59,764
Spanish Language News is here.

1172
01:01:59,808 --> 01:02:01,200
Tonight's top story:

1173
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,636
The sewers run red
with Burgundy's blood.

1174
01:02:04,636 --> 01:02:06,723
Hyah! Hyah!

1175
01:02:13,072 --> 01:02:16,421
Well looks like we got
ourselves a bilingual bloodfest.

1176
01:02:23,249 --> 01:02:26,990
Now, before we do this,
let's go over the ground rules.

1177
01:02:29,294 --> 01:02:31,512
Rule number one:

1178
01:02:31,556 --> 01:02:34,253
No touching
of the hair or face.

1179
01:02:35,296 --> 01:02:36,514
Of course.

1180
01:02:36,514 --> 01:02:38,688
And that's it!

1181
01:02:38,732 --> 01:02:40,993
Now let's do this!

1182
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:51,647
Begin!

1183
01:03:29,397 --> 01:03:31,789
I'm gonna straight-up
murder your ass!

1184
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,920
- Blade!
- Here you go, mate!

1185
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,008
Ahh! God!

1186
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:38,617
Oh! I did not
see that coming!

1187
01:03:42,313 --> 01:03:44,401
Oh! Aaah!

1188
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:47,619
- Now I'll be number one.
- No, you won't!

1189
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:52,621
Policía!

1190
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:09,017
Boy, that escalated quickly.

1191
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:12,016
I mean, that really
got out of hand fast.

1192
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,670
- It jumped up a notch.
- It did, didn't it?

1193
01:04:14,714 --> 01:04:17,105
Yeah, I stabbed
a man in the heart.

1194
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:20,714
I saw that.
Brick killed a guy.

1195
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:22,932
- Did you throw a trident?
- Yeah.

1196
01:04:22,932 --> 01:04:26,326
There were horses and a man on fire
and I killed a guy with a trident.

1197
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:28,674
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

1198
01:04:28,717 --> 01:04:31,545
Find yourself a safe house
or a relative close by.

1199
01:04:31,587 --> 01:04:35,762
Lay low for a while, because you're
probably wanted for murder.

1200
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:37,285
I'm proud of you fellas.

1201
01:04:37,285 --> 01:04:39,112
You kept your head
on a swivel.

1202
01:04:39,112 --> 01:04:42,068
That's what you gotta do when
you're in a vicious cockfight.

1203
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:44,895
Can you believe Mantooth and
the Channel 9 Evening News Team?

1204
01:04:44,938 --> 01:04:47,373
"Where's your mommy?
Someone's gotta change your diapers."

1205
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,157
This Corningstone business
is really hurting our rep.

1206
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:52,158
I know exactly
what you mean, Brian.

1207
01:04:52,158 --> 01:04:54,638
Every newsman in this city's
laughing at us.

1208
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,465
- And I don't like it.
- I don't like the put-downs.

1209
01:04:58,508 --> 01:05:00,291
We're gonna do
something about it.

1210
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:02,857
It is time to put
an end to this!

1211
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,249
Last time I looked, my name's Ron
Burgundy. What's your name?

1212
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:07,858
- Brian Fantana.
- Champ Kind.

1213
01:05:07,858 --> 01:05:09,555
- Brian Fantana.
- No, you're Brick.

1214
01:05:09,555 --> 01:05:10,771
- Brian.
- I'm Brian.

1215
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:12,338
Veronica.

1216
01:05:12,338 --> 01:05:15,686
And I've shown you, old man!

1217
01:05:15,729 --> 01:05:18,905
Garth, I need to look at these tapes
for a potential lead.

1218
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,731
Ron's using the machine

1219
01:05:20,731 --> 01:05:23,470
to play his local Emmy
acceptance speech from last year.

1220
01:05:23,514 --> 01:05:25,383
I tried to ask her
out on a date.

1221
01:05:25,383 --> 01:05:29,124
Turn the music off!
I'm still talking!

1222
01:05:29,124 --> 01:05:31,647
- This is ridiculous!
- I don't remember doing it.

1223
01:05:31,734 --> 01:05:33,952
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

1224
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:37,301
I need this machine so I can
watch a tape for a story.

1225
01:05:37,343 --> 01:05:39,430
I'm using the tape.

1226
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,519
I'm showing Jeffrey
my Emmy tape.

1227
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:43,216
We are watching history.

1228
01:05:43,216 --> 01:05:45,737
Mr. Burgundy,
I'm a professional,

1229
01:05:45,781 --> 01:05:49,347
and I would like
to be able to do my job.

1230
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,521
Big deal!
I am very professional!

1231
01:05:51,564 --> 01:05:54,131
Mr. Burgundy,
you are acting like a baby.

1232
01:05:54,173 --> 01:05:57,871
I'm not a baby, I am a man.
I am an anchorman!

1233
01:05:57,914 --> 01:06:00,785
You are not a man.
You are a big fat joke!

1234
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:02,786
I'm a man
who discovered the wheel

1235
01:06:02,786 --> 01:06:06,047
and built the Eiffel Tower
out of metal and brawn.

1236
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,875
That's what
kind of man I am.

1237
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:10,570
You're just a woman
with a small brain.

1238
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:14,442
With a brain a third the size of us.
It's science.

1239
01:06:14,484 --> 01:06:17,399
I will have you know
that I have more talent

1240
01:06:17,399 --> 01:06:19,834
and more intelligence
in my little finger

1241
01:06:19,877 --> 01:06:22,356
than you do
in your entire body, sir!

1242
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,880
You are a smelly
pirate hooker!

1243
01:06:24,922 --> 01:06:27,183
You look like a blueberry.

1244
01:06:27,227 --> 01:06:30,314
Why don't you go back
to your home on Whore lsland?

1245
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:33,620
Well, you have bad hair.

1246
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:37,969
What did you say?

1247
01:06:37,969 --> 01:06:39,752
I said

1248
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:41,492
your hair

1249
01:06:41,492 --> 01:06:44,274
Iooks stupid.

1250
01:06:51,146 --> 01:06:54,451
- Let 'em work it out!
- It's between the two of them!

1251
01:07:06,933 --> 01:07:09,456
They're just talking.
Just talking.

1252
01:07:09,498 --> 01:07:11,978
- I hate you!
- I hate you more!

1253
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:25,284
Ow!

1254
01:07:25,284 --> 01:07:27,851
Shut up! Shut up!

1255
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:33,331
All right, stop!

1256
01:07:33,331 --> 01:07:35,331
Stop what you're doing
right now!

1257
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:38,376
I will not have
my newsroom be divided.

1258
01:07:39,898 --> 01:07:42,247
Ah! Knights of Columbus,
that hurts!

1259
01:07:44,464 --> 01:07:46,552
I was like, "Who is that guy?"

1260
01:07:50,248 --> 01:07:53,249
I just can't believe
what Ron did to you.

1261
01:07:53,293 --> 01:07:55,728
It is so awful.

1262
01:07:55,728 --> 01:07:57,773
Yes.

1263
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,990
Have you ever thought
about fighting fire

1264
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,382
with fire?

1265
01:08:04,556 --> 01:08:06,427
What do you mean?

1266
01:08:06,427 --> 01:08:10,514
I have some information
that you can choose to use or not use.

1267
01:08:10,557 --> 01:08:11,993
Up to you.

1268
01:08:12,037 --> 01:08:14,211
Ron Burgundy

1269
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:17,734
will read anything
that is put on that Teleprompter.

1270
01:08:17,777 --> 01:08:19,778
And when I say anything,

1271
01:08:19,778 --> 01:08:22,214
I mean an-y-thing.

1272
01:08:30,999 --> 01:08:32,302
Arnold, cue one.

1273
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:34,391
After the FotoMat
was destroyed,

1274
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:37,173
the bear scampered
back into the woods.

1275
01:08:37,217 --> 01:08:40,087
Apparently he wasn't too happy
with his color prints.

1276
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:42,219
Oh.

1277
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:45,088
From the entire
Channel 4 News Team,

1278
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:46,871
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

1279
01:08:46,871 --> 01:08:48,264
And I'm Ron Burgundy.

1280
01:08:48,264 --> 01:08:50,830
Go fuck yourself,
San Diego.

1281
01:08:56,874 --> 01:08:59,354
What in the name--

1282
01:08:59,397 --> 01:09:01,397
No!

1283
01:09:01,397 --> 01:09:03,659
Nobody talks about
my city that way!

1284
01:09:03,703 --> 01:09:05,790
Ron Burgundy's ass
is grass!

1285
01:09:08,529 --> 01:09:11,445
Nice work, everyone.
Sharp broadcast.

1286
01:09:11,487 --> 01:09:13,878
Really good.
Everyone on the floor as well.

1287
01:09:13,922 --> 01:09:16,010
Really a lot of hustle.
I liked it.

1288
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:19,186
Dump out! Dump out!

1289
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:21,316
Hello, Edward.

1290
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,186
- Ron, I've got to fire you.
- I've got to fire you.

1291
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,274
Bing, bong, bong.
You're fired, Ed.

1292
01:09:26,274 --> 01:09:29,319
Do you even know
what you just said?

1293
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:32,580
Great Odin's raven!

1294
01:09:32,623 --> 01:09:34,667
Are you happy, Ron?

1295
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:37,581
Veronica.
She put that in the Teleprompter.

1296
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:41,930
You're probably right,
but this is bad, Ron. Real bad.

1297
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,018
My hands are tied. I--

1298
01:09:44,018 --> 01:09:45,801
I gotta fire you.

1299
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:48,280
Ed, let's hold on.
Let's count to 10.

1300
01:09:48,323 --> 01:09:52,062
That's a rash decision.
Is this about something else?

1301
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:56,455
Ed, there's 300
very angry San Diego-ites.

1302
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,978
San Diego-ins.
San Diego-uns.

1303
01:09:59,021 --> 01:10:01,326
- San Dieg-ons.
- San Diegans.

1304
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:03,588
San Diegans out
in front of the station.

1305
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,416
They want Ron's blood.

1306
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:06,849
They want to hurt you.

1307
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:10,155
Why did you say that? Why?

1308
01:10:10,155 --> 01:10:12,678
Why, Ron? Why?

1309
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:15,070
You're my hero, Ron.

1310
01:10:15,114 --> 01:10:16,462
Garth, l--

1311
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:20,462
And you come out
with stink like that poop!

1312
01:10:20,506 --> 01:10:25,333
You poop mouth!
Get all the poop out of your mouth!

1313
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:29,247
If I were to give you money out
of my wallet, would that ease the pain?

1314
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,465
I hate you, Ron Burgundy!
I hate you!

1315
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,337
Ron? Ron!

1316
01:10:40,424 --> 01:10:43,469
I can't believe you did this to me!
Are you happy?

1317
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,338
No, Ron, I'm not!

1318
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:47,512
I have nothing left!
Nothing!

1319
01:10:47,556 --> 01:10:49,731
I've been reduced to rubble!

1320
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:53,471
Let's go. These people
are about to pull you apart.

1321
01:10:55,776 --> 01:10:59,081
No! No!

1322
01:11:11,606 --> 01:11:13,998
Mr. Burgundy, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

1323
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:16,955
- Please, l--
- You're an awful man!

1324
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:20,826
You are truly a disappointment
to us all, Mr. Burgundy!

1325
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:24,610
Bob Dylan once wrote,

1326
01:11:24,653 --> 01:11:26,653
"The times,
they are a-changin'."

1327
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:29,089
Ron Burgundy
had never heard that song.

1328
01:11:29,132 --> 01:11:33,177
So when he fell, he fell hard.

1329
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:40,658
It's Channel 4 News at 6:00!

1330
01:11:40,701 --> 01:11:42,310
Good evening, San Diego.

1331
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:45,920
I'm lead anchor
Veronica Corningstone.

1332
01:11:45,963 --> 01:11:49,050
Tonight's top story:
an ultrasound of Ling Wong,

1333
01:11:49,093 --> 01:11:51,225
the most famous panda
in the world,

1334
01:11:51,268 --> 01:11:54,095
shows that her baby
is doing quite well.

1335
01:11:54,139 --> 01:11:57,227
No!

1336
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:04,577
Ron Burgundy, stay classy.

1337
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:06,925
Hello, this is Ron.

1338
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:08,272
Hello.

1339
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:11,056
Who's there?
I'm talking. Hello.

1340
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,754
Who is this?

1341
01:12:12,754 --> 01:12:15,405
Baxter, is that you?

1342
01:12:15,449 --> 01:12:16,840
Baxter!

1343
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,928
Bark twice
if you're in Milwaukee.

1344
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:21,972
Is this Wilt Chamberlain?

1345
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:25,060
Have the courage
to say something. Hello!

1346
01:12:27,364 --> 01:12:29,453
Hello!

1347
01:12:34,932 --> 01:12:37,584
Hey, you watch
yourself, mister.

1348
01:12:37,628 --> 01:12:40,325
Hey, lady in
the red hat. Yeah.

1349
01:12:40,368 --> 01:12:42,456
You smell.

1350
01:12:44,849 --> 01:12:48,196
Guys.
Guys, it's me, Ron.

1351
01:12:48,241 --> 01:12:49,762
Fellas!

1352
01:12:49,762 --> 01:12:52,241
Harken said he'd fire us
if we talked to you.

1353
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:55,677
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1354
01:12:55,721 --> 01:12:58,113
I-- Brian!

1355
01:12:58,113 --> 01:13:00,243
- It's Ronnie!
- Ron!

1356
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:02,375
- Champ!
- Ron!

1357
01:13:02,418 --> 01:13:04,462
Champ, come on.
Come on!

1358
01:13:04,462 --> 01:13:05,854
Go, Brick.

1359
01:13:05,854 --> 01:13:08,027
My sweet Brick.

1360
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:11,115
Brick, come hug me.
I know you want to.

1361
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:15,987
I am completely
miserable, San Diego!

1362
01:13:19,335 --> 01:13:21,423
It's so damn hot!

1363
01:13:24,207 --> 01:13:26,294
Milk was a bad choice!

1364
01:13:33,557 --> 01:13:35,557
Yes, yes.
Chris, listen to me.

1365
01:13:35,557 --> 01:13:38,820
Put down the gun
and let the marching band go.

1366
01:13:38,862 --> 01:13:41,342
We'll play it off as a prank.

1367
01:13:41,342 --> 01:13:44,168
We'll straighten it out later.
I'm getting another call.

1368
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:46,168
Ed Harken.

1369
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:48,300
What?
Oh, my God!

1370
01:13:48,344 --> 01:13:52,997
Listen, everybody, Ling Wong
the panda is giving birth!

1371
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,998
Get Corningstone
over there right away!

1372
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,086
The network
is picking up the feed.

1373
01:13:58,086 --> 01:14:01,085
I want a shot
of that panda being born!

1374
01:14:07,784 --> 01:14:10,306
This is Ted Nightingale,
Channel 6 News Los Angeles,

1375
01:14:10,348 --> 01:14:12,001
reporting from
the San Diego Zoo.

1376
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:13,698
And this is the moment

1377
01:14:13,698 --> 01:14:16,307
the entire world
has been waiting for.

1378
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:19,569
I can only speculate
as to the sex of the panda,

1379
01:14:19,569 --> 01:14:22,656
but if I had to guess,
I'd say female.

1380
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:24,961
- Excuse me. Press.
- Hey, lady, watch it.

1381
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:27,527
Excuse me, I'm press.
Thank you. What do you got?

1382
01:14:27,571 --> 01:14:29,833
Nothing. All I can see
is a blue curtain.

1383
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:31,962
Oh, damn it.

1384
01:14:31,962 --> 01:14:36,443
Go over there and see
if you can get a shot. I'll go this way.

1385
01:14:36,486 --> 01:14:39,531
Hey, lady, why don't you
go fetch me a sandwich?

1386
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:42,140
Okay, I'll go get your sandwich.

1387
01:14:42,183 --> 01:14:45,359
Then I'll show you the ratings where
you're number two to a woman.

1388
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:48,229
Ouch. Don't lose
any more hair over it.

1389
01:14:49,446 --> 01:14:51,577
- Whatever.
- We're live, Mr. Mantooth.

1390
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:55,534
Good afternoon,
San Diego.

1391
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:58,231
We're here today to celebrate
the birth of a panda.

1392
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:01,015
# Sky rockets in flight #

1393
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:06,407
# Afternoon delight #

1394
01:15:06,451 --> 01:15:08,929
# Af-- #

1395
01:15:08,929 --> 01:15:12,192
# I make fart noises
with my mouth #

1396
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,758
- # And I like to cut-- #
- Hey, nut job!

1397
01:15:15,801 --> 01:15:17,454
Quit the singin'!

1398
01:15:17,454 --> 01:15:19,541
Creeping out
all the regulars.

1399
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:23,673
I'm expressing my inner anguish
through the majesty of song!

1400
01:15:23,716 --> 01:15:26,761
Look, drunkie, you been
coming in here every day,

1401
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:28,892
stinking up the joint
with your craziness.

1402
01:15:28,935 --> 01:15:30,979
Now, what the hell
is wrong with you?

1403
01:15:30,979 --> 01:15:32,979
I got no heart!

1404
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:35,284
Because a she-devil stole it!

1405
01:15:35,327 --> 01:15:37,937
You know what the worst
part about it is?

1406
01:15:39,981 --> 01:15:42,068
She's better than me!

1407
01:15:43,592 --> 01:15:45,678
She's better than me.

1408
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:48,896
You know, times are changing.

1409
01:15:50,071 --> 01:15:52,332
Ladies can do stuff now.

1410
01:15:52,376 --> 01:15:55,203
You're gonna have to learn
how to deal with that.

1411
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:57,725
What?
Were you saying something?

1412
01:15:57,769 --> 01:16:00,075
Look, I don't
speak Spanish.

1413
01:16:00,117 --> 01:16:02,204
Ah.

1414
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:12,729
Scotty.

1415
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:15,338
Scotty, I have the shot.

1416
01:16:15,381 --> 01:16:17,427
Scotty. Scotty!

1417
01:16:17,427 --> 01:16:19,427
Hey, uh,

1418
01:16:19,427 --> 01:16:22,383
that is some fantastic
shot you got there.

1419
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:25,819
The kind of shot that gets you
to the top of network news.

1420
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:29,255
- Oh, well, we hope.
- We at public television,

1421
01:16:29,299 --> 01:16:33,735
we're really down
with the woman's lib thing.

1422
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:36,083
That is so refreshing to me.

1423
01:16:36,127 --> 01:16:38,605
Because the struggle I've--

1424
01:16:41,867 --> 01:16:45,173
Howie, we have the shot.

1425
01:16:45,173 --> 01:16:47,173
Up a little.
Up, up.

1426
01:16:47,216 --> 01:16:49,303
Oh.
You son of a bitch!

1427
01:16:49,347 --> 01:16:51,348
Shh!

1428
01:16:51,348 --> 01:16:53,478
Don't want to wake up
your friends.

1429
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:05,742
Help!

1430
01:17:05,742 --> 01:17:08,352
- Simply vanished.
- How do you lose your lead anchor?

1431
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:10,874
- I can't find Corningstone.
- Where the hell is she?

1432
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,919
- No one's seen her.
- I can't believe this.

1433
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:16,441
Every news outlet in the world
is looking for coverage on this.

1434
01:17:16,485 --> 01:17:19,530
I've got no damn lead anchor!

1435
01:17:19,572 --> 01:17:22,008
Damn it! Get me a phone.

1436
01:17:22,052 --> 01:17:24,401
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1437
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,097
Rocky's,
bar, grill, fine dining.

1438
01:17:29,097 --> 01:17:32,054
- Is there an anchorman there?
- Hold on.

1439
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:34,881
This is killing me.
I'd rather slit my throat.

1440
01:17:34,924 --> 01:17:37,490
- Hello?
- Hello?

1441
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:39,534
- Is this Ron?
- Who is this?

1442
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:41,535
- It's me. Ed.
- Who?

1443
01:17:41,535 --> 01:17:44,057
- Ed Harken.
- I don't know a Ned.

1444
01:17:44,101 --> 01:17:46,362
- Ed Harken!
- Ed!

1445
01:17:46,406 --> 01:17:48,667
- Ed, hello.
- Listen, Ron.

1446
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:52,537
Corningstone disappeared in the midst
of the biggest story of the year.

1447
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:54,669
We need you down here
right away.

1448
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:56,365
Wait, Ed.

1449
01:17:56,365 --> 01:17:59,539
Does this mean you're asking me
to report the news again?

1450
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:03,279
- Yes.
- Ed!

1451
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:05,410
That's wonderful!
Thank you!

1452
01:18:05,454 --> 01:18:07,803
Ed, hold on.
I want to say a few words.

1453
01:18:07,846 --> 01:18:11,152
- You have always been a good friend!
- Right.

1454
01:18:11,195 --> 01:18:13,282
- Always!
- Right.

1455
01:18:15,283 --> 01:18:17,761
Get down here
as quickly as you can.

1456
01:18:17,805 --> 01:18:19,849
Ed, I'll be down there.

1457
01:18:20,937 --> 01:18:23,589
And I'm going to look good.

1458
01:18:33,288 --> 01:18:36,723
Good evening.
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1459
01:18:36,766 --> 01:18:39,159
Damn!
That dude cleans up good!

1460
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:43,335
If I'm gonna do this, I'll need
my news team at my side.

1461
01:18:51,075 --> 01:18:53,119
News team!

1462
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:55,685
Assemble!

1463
01:19:02,817 --> 01:19:06,339
News team, assemble!

1464
01:19:08,254 --> 01:19:10,168
Hey, Ron.

1465
01:19:10,168 --> 01:19:11,820
What's up?

1466
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,342
Oh.

1467
01:19:13,342 --> 01:19:15,603
Hi.
Didn't see you there.

1468
01:19:15,646 --> 01:19:18,996
We've been here literally
the entire time you have.

1469
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,953
I'm a little embarrassed.

1470
01:19:21,997 --> 01:19:24,085
Look.

1471
01:19:24,128 --> 01:19:28,390
I just got the call from Harken.
He wants me back.

1472
01:19:28,433 --> 01:19:30,738
But I can't do this
without my news team.

1473
01:19:30,782 --> 01:19:32,435
I don't know, Ron.

1474
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:35,174
That was half a lifetime ago.
We're different people now.

1475
01:19:35,218 --> 01:19:37,217
When you left,
the hurt was so deep.

1476
01:19:37,217 --> 01:19:39,783
I don't know if I can
go through that again.

1477
01:19:39,827 --> 01:19:41,828
Think about
what you're asking.

1478
01:19:41,828 --> 01:19:43,828
Man.

1479
01:19:43,828 --> 01:19:45,916
Gentlemen,

1480
01:19:46,872 --> 01:19:49,221
there was a time

1481
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:52,222
when you called me
your lead anchor.

1482
01:19:55,397 --> 01:19:57,616
Will you follow me again?

1483
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:01,702
I'm gettin' too old
for this shit.

1484
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:03,747
To the news van!

1485
01:20:03,747 --> 01:20:06,486
- To the news van!
- Okay!

1486
01:20:16,098 --> 01:20:18,490
Ahh!

1487
01:20:18,533 --> 01:20:20,664
Well, I'll be.
Ron Burgundy.

1488
01:20:20,707 --> 01:20:22,403
He's back!

1489
01:20:22,403 --> 01:20:25,404
Gentlemen, let's try
to get in a good position for the story.

1490
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,405
- How does the hair look?
- Magnificent.

1491
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:29,536
You have hair like an angel.

1492
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:32,450
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Network talent scout.

1493
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,930
- This is a hot one.
- I'm actually nervous.

1494
01:20:35,972 --> 01:20:38,059
Let's go get 'em.

1495
01:20:38,103 --> 01:20:40,016
Wait! Did you
just hear something?

1496
01:20:40,016 --> 01:20:42,757
Help.

1497
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:45,279
- Ron, help!
- Veronica!

1498
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:47,497
- Are you okay?
- Shh!

1499
01:20:47,497 --> 01:20:49,193
How did you
get down there?

1500
01:20:49,193 --> 01:20:51,280
Just go get someone.
Please.

1501
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,629
Hold on.
Hold on!

1502
01:20:56,804 --> 01:20:58,631
We've got to do something.

1503
01:20:58,631 --> 01:21:01,110
Whoa, Ron, I don't want
to sound cruel, but--

1504
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:03,457
There's a network
talent scout over there.

1505
01:21:03,501 --> 01:21:05,589
This is a tough decision.

1506
01:21:05,633 --> 01:21:08,241
So much to think about.

1507
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:10,808
Basically the biggest story
of my career,

1508
01:21:10,808 --> 01:21:14,635
Iaunching me to a level
I've never known before,

1509
01:21:14,635 --> 01:21:16,113
or saving the woman

1510
01:21:16,113 --> 01:21:19,463
I used to have
familiar relations with.

1511
01:21:19,463 --> 01:21:22,158
This is hard!

1512
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:24,811
I am in a pickle!

1513
01:21:24,855 --> 01:21:27,247
Ron, I know
it sounds harsh,

1514
01:21:27,247 --> 01:21:29,769
but God does not
want her to live.

1515
01:21:29,812 --> 01:21:31,899
No. Hold on.

1516
01:21:33,206 --> 01:21:35,293
It's clear now.

1517
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,380
We go into the bear pit.

1518
01:21:40,686 --> 01:21:42,773
Ron, don't.

1519
01:21:44,773 --> 01:21:46,860
Oh!

1520
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:51,949
I immediately
regret this decision.

1521
01:21:51,992 --> 01:21:54,515
What are you doing?
Why didn't you get help?

1522
01:21:54,558 --> 01:21:56,950
These bears are massive!

1523
01:21:56,994 --> 01:21:59,646
They looked
a lot smaller from up there.

1524
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,518
Fan out.
Let's go find Harken.

1525
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:05,170
Stay calm.

1526
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:10,562
It's all right. I think it's all right,
my sweet chinchilla.

1527
01:22:10,606 --> 01:22:12,693
- Oh, Ron.
- Yes, yes.

1528
01:22:12,737 --> 01:22:14,869
In case we die here today,

1529
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:17,782
there's something
that you should know.

1530
01:22:17,824 --> 01:22:20,826
That dirty trick
with the Teleprompter, it wasn't--

1531
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:24,306
Sweet Eli Whitney's nose!
It wasn't you, was it?

1532
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:26,741
It was Wes Mantooth.

1533
01:22:26,785 --> 01:22:29,698
- Oh, I should have known.
- No, no.

1534
01:22:29,742 --> 01:22:32,090
- No, I did it.
- You bitch!

1535
01:22:32,134 --> 01:22:35,221
Shh!

1536
01:22:36,396 --> 01:22:38,700
You woke the bears.
Why did you do that?

1537
01:22:41,788 --> 01:22:45,399
There's somebody
in the bear pit!

1538
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:50,834
It took
my impending death

1539
01:22:50,877 --> 01:22:53,530
for me to realize
how much I need you.

1540
01:22:53,573 --> 01:22:55,878
Oh, Ron.

1541
01:22:59,228 --> 01:23:01,227
Those bears
are gonna hurt them!

1542
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:04,054
News team, let's hunt.

1543
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:07,579
News team!

1544
01:23:10,578 --> 01:23:12,665
Bear fight!

1545
01:23:14,927 --> 01:23:17,450
Come on.
Come on!

1546
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:25,408
Damn!

1547
01:23:25,408 --> 01:23:27,496
Hit 'em in the uvula!

1548
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:29,757
Hey, Ron!

1549
01:23:29,757 --> 01:23:31,845
I'm riding a furry tractor!

1550
01:23:32,759 --> 01:23:35,194
The bears have descended
on the news team

1551
01:23:35,236 --> 01:23:36,889
and it's not going well.

1552
01:23:36,889 --> 01:23:39,890
Clearly, after today,
I will no longer--

1553
01:23:39,934 --> 01:23:42,587
Come on!
Oh, God!

1554
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:45,066
It's getting to be
ri-goddamn-diculous!

1555
01:23:46,762 --> 01:23:48,197
Oh, no.

1556
01:23:48,197 --> 01:23:51,285
We woke up the mama.

1557
01:23:53,851 --> 01:23:55,938
Oh, God!

1558
01:23:56,851 --> 01:23:59,287
I don't wanna die.

1559
01:24:04,985 --> 01:24:09,115
Baxter!

1560
01:24:47,388 --> 01:24:49,865
Look! They're following their mother!

1561
01:24:49,865 --> 01:24:51,257
It's instinct.

1562
01:24:51,257 --> 01:24:53,562
Oh, Baxter!

1563
01:24:53,606 --> 01:24:57,998
Oh! Oh, Baxter,
you're still alive!

1564
01:24:57,998 --> 01:25:01,391
Oh, I'm so happy!

1565
01:25:01,434 --> 01:25:05,088
I'm so happy!
You are alive!

1566
01:25:05,131 --> 01:25:07,739
I'm so happy!

1567
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:15,568
I will lick you!

1568
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:18,656
I will lick you in front
of everyone to show my joy.

1569
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,787
Oh. Ohhh!

1570
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:23,875
Boy, he really
likes that dog.

1571
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:26,354
Burgundy!
Burgundy!

1572
01:25:26,398 --> 01:25:28,745
Burgundy! Burgundy!

1573
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:31,398
Burgundy!
Burgundy!

1574
01:25:31,442 --> 01:25:33,704
Hi, Ron.

1575
01:25:33,747 --> 01:25:36,878
It's always a long fall
from the top, isn't it?

1576
01:25:36,921 --> 01:25:38,401
Easy, Wes.

1577
01:25:38,401 --> 01:25:41,792
I've been waiting
to say this to you for a long time.

1578
01:25:41,835 --> 01:25:44,227
- All right.
- Deep down in my stomach,

1579
01:25:44,227 --> 01:25:45,924
with every inch of me,

1580
01:25:45,924 --> 01:25:48,750
I pure, straight

1581
01:25:48,794 --> 01:25:50,882
hate you!

1582
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:57,971
But, God damn it,
do I respect you!

1583
01:26:11,018 --> 01:26:12,496
Thank you,

1584
01:26:12,496 --> 01:26:14,584
brother.

1585
01:26:16,193 --> 01:26:19,455
Burgundy!
Burgundy!

1586
01:26:19,455 --> 01:26:21,935
Today we spell redemption

1587
01:26:21,935 --> 01:26:23,978
R-O-N.

1588
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:26,804
Burgundy!
Burgundy!

1589
01:26:26,847 --> 01:26:28,718
Ron, you're my hero!

1590
01:26:28,718 --> 01:26:32,544
Ron, I think you've got
a story to report.

1591
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:36,719
Are you sure, Ed?

1592
01:26:37,111 --> 01:26:39,024
Do it.

1593
01:26:39,024 --> 01:26:41,633
It's the story
you were born to tell.

1594
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:49,158
San Diego's waiting.
Go get 'em.

1595
01:26:49,201 --> 01:26:50,810
Make way!

1596
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:53,811
Ron Burgundy's about
to report on pandas!

1597
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:57,899
Count me down.
Three.

1598
01:26:57,899 --> 01:26:59,986
You're live, Mr. Burgundy.

1599
01:26:59,986 --> 01:27:01,988
This is Ron Burgundy,

1600
01:27:01,988 --> 01:27:05,857
proudly reporting once again
for Channel 4 News.

1601
01:27:05,901 --> 01:27:09,729
Today's story is one
of the more remarkable things

1602
01:27:09,773 --> 01:27:12,859
ever to happen
to San Diago

1603
01:27:12,903 --> 01:27:14,643
or even the world.

1604
01:27:14,643 --> 01:27:17,644
But in order
to properly retell it,

1605
01:27:17,644 --> 01:27:19,992
I'm going to need
some help

1606
01:27:20,036 --> 01:27:22,383
from my co-anchor,

1607
01:27:23,602 --> 01:27:25,645
Miss Veronica Corningstone.

1608
01:27:27,777 --> 01:27:30,474
- High-pressure system--
- No, no, no, no, Brick.

1609
01:27:30,517 --> 01:27:32,604
- High-pressure system--
- Go stand over there.

1610
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:37,997
Oh, Ron.

1611
01:27:37,997 --> 01:27:40,346
Ron, there are literally
thousands of men

1612
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:41,998
that I should
be with instead,

1613
01:27:41,998 --> 01:27:45,130
but I am 72% sure
that I love you.

1614
01:27:52,349 --> 01:27:55,523
Yes, redemption was
sweet for Ron Burgundy.

1615
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:58,263
Yes!
Ron!

1616
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:01,960
- As for the news team:
- Stop it! Ron!

1617
01:28:02,004 --> 01:28:05,395
Champ Kind went on to become
a commentator for the NFL,

1618
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:08,004
but was later fired
after being accused

1619
01:28:08,048 --> 01:28:11,702
of sexual harassment
by Terry Bradshaw.

1620
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:13,790
Excuse me.

1621
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,355
Is that Sex Panther
you're wearing?

1622
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:21,182
Brian Fantana went on
to have great success

1623
01:28:21,226 --> 01:28:23,749
as the host of the hit
reality TV show

1624
01:28:23,791 --> 01:28:26,662
"lntercourse lsland"
on the Fox Network.

1625
01:28:26,706 --> 01:28:29,402
Anyone seen Brick?

1626
01:28:29,446 --> 01:28:31,490
- Brick?
- Don't! That tickles!

1627
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,707
No, that tickles me!
Come on!

1628
01:28:34,751 --> 01:28:37,708
Brick Tamland
is married with 1 1 children

1629
01:28:37,752 --> 01:28:39,970
and is one of the top
political advisors

1630
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:41,753
to the Bush White House.

1631
01:28:41,753 --> 01:28:44,405
I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!

1632
01:28:54,974 --> 01:28:58,148
And Ron and Veronica
didn't stay in San Diego long.

1633
01:29:02,063 --> 01:29:04,194
I chose them
as my replacement,

1634
01:29:04,237 --> 01:29:07,629
and they became the first
mixed-gender network news team,

1635
01:29:07,672 --> 01:29:09,933
and they're still
doing it today.

1636
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:13,065
From all of us here
at the World News Center,

1637
01:29:13,109 --> 01:29:14,892
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

1638
01:29:14,892 --> 01:29:16,762
And I'm Ron Burgundy.

1639
01:29:16,762 --> 01:29:19,415
You stay classy, planet Earth.

Oh!
Great Odin's raven!

1646
01:29:40,463 --> 01:29:43,942
Oh!
By the hammer of Thor!

1647
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:47,596
Oh!
Saint Damien's beard!

1648
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,163
Sweet grandmother's spatula!

1649
01:29:50,206 --> 01:29:52,989
Oh! Hot pot of coffee!

1650
01:29:53,033 --> 01:29:56,468
Uncle Jonathan's
corncob pipe!

1651
01:29:59,121 --> 01:30:01,991
I'm gonna shoot you with a BB gun
when you're not looking.

1652
01:30:02,035 --> 01:30:04,036
In the back of the head.

1653
01:30:04,036 --> 01:30:06,558
I'm sorry.

1654
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:10,297
You're not very bright.
You know that, right?

1655
01:30:10,341 --> 01:30:12,038
You're actually
quite a dullard.

1656
01:30:12,038 --> 01:30:14,431
Everyone here knows it.

1657
01:30:14,473 --> 01:30:18,605
If I'm a dullard,
you're the, uh, the dull--

1658
01:30:18,648 --> 01:30:21,823
Oh! Can't think of
anything to say, can you?

1659
01:30:21,866 --> 01:30:24,868
Yes, I can. I can think
of a lot of things to say.

1660
01:30:24,868 --> 01:30:26,954
Like, you're a dirty bitch.

1661
01:30:29,868 --> 01:30:32,173
Well, Ron, I'm gonna
put poison--

1662
01:30:32,216 --> 01:30:34,304
Oh, my God!

1663
01:30:38,783 --> 01:30:42,002
I drank a lava lamp.
It wasn't lava.

1664
01:30:42,045 --> 01:30:44,394
I ate a whole bunch
of fiberglass insulation.

1665
01:30:44,437 --> 01:30:48,873
It wasn't cotton candy
like that guy said.

1666
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:50,527
My stomach's itchy.

1667
01:30:50,527 --> 01:30:51,744
I pooped a hammer.

1668
01:30:51,744 --> 01:30:53,918
I pooped
a tape recorder.

1669
01:30:53,961 --> 01:30:56,049
I pooped
a Cornish game hen.

1670
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:00,572
Uh...

1671
01:31:00,572 --> 01:31:02,659
Nope.

1672
01:31:03,616 --> 01:31:05,660
You do not take
a tone with me,

1673
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:08,922
'cause I will give you a rap right
on the Jack Johnson!

1674
01:31:08,966 --> 01:31:10,488
- Okay.
- Yes.

1675
01:31:10,488 --> 01:31:12,270
Now this
is happenin'.

1676
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:13,924
What are
you doing?

1677
01:31:13,924 --> 01:31:16,012
- Hah!
- What are you doing?

1678
01:31:16,055 --> 01:31:18,141
What are you--

1679
01:31:22,404 --> 01:31:23,622
Action.

1680
01:31:23,622 --> 01:31:25,710
We'll go back to doing
what I do best--

1681
01:31:25,753 --> 01:31:28,537
I guess we'll go back to doing
what I do best, show off.

1682
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:30,536
When do we
get started?

1683
01:31:30,536 --> 01:31:32,276
When do we get started?

1684
01:31:32,276 --> 01:31:34,276
- That's my line.
- When do we get started?

1685
01:31:34,276 --> 01:31:36,277
You say,
"Whenever you like."

1686
01:31:36,277 --> 01:31:38,017
Whenever you like.

1687
01:31:38,017 --> 01:31:40,104
Keep it rollin'.
This is good stuff.

1688
01:31:41,104 --> 01:31:43,931
...an area bank
in a daring...

1689
01:31:43,975 --> 01:31:47,194
Probably not the same one.
Probably not the same guy.

1690
01:31:54,935 --> 01:31:56,979
Brick, before I let you go,

1691
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:59,588
are you still having your celebrity
golf tournament this summer?

1692
01:31:59,588 --> 01:32:01,588
No, too many people
died last year.

1693
01:32:01,632 --> 01:32:03,806
So we're not gonna do--

1694
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,937
Sorry. Sorry.

1695
01:32:06,633 --> 01:32:09,938
They named it
San Diego.

1696
01:32:09,938 --> 01:32:13,722
Which in German means,
"a whale's vagina."

1697
01:32:20,289 --> 01:32:22,812
This is the most
ridiculous thing ever.

1698
01:32:43,903 --> 01:32:47,513
# Carry on, my wayward son #

1699
01:32:47,557 --> 01:32:51,340
# There'll be peace
when you are done #

1700
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:55,038
# Lay your weary head
to rest #

1701
01:32:55,081 --> 01:32:56,211
# Don't you cry #

1702
01:32:56,211 --> 01:32:59,169
# Don't you cry no more #

1703
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:18,652
Way to handle him.
That was nice.

1704
01:33:18,696 --> 01:33:20,565
It sure is good
to be number one.

1705
01:33:20,565 --> 01:33:23,219
It sure beats the hell
out of number two.

1706
01:33:24,653 --> 01:33:27,046
We are laughing!

1707
01:33:27,046 --> 01:33:29,393
And we are
very good friends.

1708
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:32,395
Good buddies sharing
a special moment.

1709
01:33:32,439 --> 01:33:35,265
Don't say anything, Ron.
Just let it happen.

1710
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:38,353
We're laughing,
enjoying our friendship.

1711
01:33:38,353 --> 01:33:41,832
And someday we'll look back
on this with much fondness.

1712
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:46,051
Yeah.
