1
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,072
Christ.

2
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,655
Hey.

3
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,864
- Yeah?

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,252
Yeah?

5
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,133
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

6
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,259
Wait a minute, slow down.

7
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,464
Slow down.

8
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,602
Hold On.

9
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,768
Yeah.

10
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,698
No, I've been up
since the crack of dawn.

11
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,029
What tuition?

12
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,870
How much does it cost?

13
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,040
No.

14
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,539
No. No, no, no.

15
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,710
That's not true. That's not true.

16
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,675
You're the one that wanted him to go
to private school, not me.

17
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,719
Well, put Knuckles on the phone.

18
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,799
Then tell him it's a two-way street.

19
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,101
I call him, he's gotta call me.

20
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,562
Oh, he's my son now?

21
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,811
Because you want him to go to...

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,733
You want a fucking tuition check.

23
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,020
Huh?

24
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,232
That's great, Deana. That's great.

25
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,613
You call me, 7:00
in the morning in Orlando

26
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,452
to shake me down for fucking money.
That's great.

27
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,746
Does he even
want to go to the fucking school?

28
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,749
All right, look, just...
I got a 9:00 flight.

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,123
Sit tight. I'll be in Atlanta in a minute.

30
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,589
And how am I a liar?

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,762
Yeah, but how does that
make me a liar?

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,554
How...

33
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,264
All right.

34
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,436
All right.

35
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,599
All right, bye.

36
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,945
Was that your wife?

37
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,776
My ex-wife.

38
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,698
- Mmm.

39
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,783
But you, Trina, you could
be my second wife.

40
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,831
<i>Mmm-mmm. Don't joke about that, papi.</i>

41
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,954
Oh.

42
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,123
- Our flight's at 9:00.
- Flight's at 9:00.

43
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,411
Let's get to it.

44
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,463
Yes, let's get to it.

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,882
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.
I should have...

46
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,009
I should have ate something.

47
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,936
Ahhh!

48
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,647
I'll figure that out for you

49
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,742
after all the passengers get on board.
Is that okay?

50
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,323
- Okay.
- Good morning, Trina.

51
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,533
Good morning, Captain Whitaker.

52
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm sorry, sir,
you're going to have to check that bag.

53
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,376
Margaret.

54
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,082
- Captain Whitaker.
- Good morning.

55
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,508
That sky gonna hold?

56
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
You're not gonna make me spend
another night in Orlando.

57
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,714
Don't worry, I will get you to
your prayer meeting on time.

58
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,598
What is it, Jesus Christ Superstar,

59
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,183
First 27th Baptists?

60
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,343
That's right.
Christ the King First Baptist Church

61
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,557
on Hazel and Ninth.

62
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,798
And I'm still saving
a seat for you, right next to me.

63
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,562
- Save two.
- I will.

64
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,452
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Captain.

65
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,395
Walk around is complete.

66
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,025
Margaret!

67
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,072
Yeah, could you get me
a cup of coffee, black,

68
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,754
lots of sugar and a couple of aspirins,

69
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,181
- okay, sweetie?
- Mmm-hmm.

70
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,582
- Okay, you want something?
- No, ma'am, thank you.

71
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,334
Have we flown together before?

72
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,413
- I don't think so, sir.
- You sure?

73
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,089
Yeah. Ken Evans.

74
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,757
Whip Whitaker.

75
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,377
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

76
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,755
Oxygen check.

77
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,268
That checks. You want a hit?

78
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,601
- Uh, no, thank you, sir.
- You sure?

79
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,433
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

80
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,116
Sir, it's 8:50.

81
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,621
Is it? All right, well, let's push.

82
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,740
I got a great on time record.

83
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,622
Yes, sir, you got it.

84
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,961
How are you feeling today, sir?

85
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,918
A little tired. A quick turnaround for me,

86
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,299
10 turns in three days. Off tomorrow.

87
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,298
- Here's your coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

88
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,804
- And your aspirin.
- Thank you.

89
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,478
And the manifest
with 102 souls on board.

90
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,146
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

91
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,641
Let's get them tucked in.
We're ready to push.

92
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,525
You got it.

93
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,175
Oh, please don't pick up.

94
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,967
Don't pick up.

95
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,519
<i>Yo.</i>

96
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,814
Hi, it's Nic. Do you have any?

97
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,442
- Kip.

98
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,882
Hey, baby, come here. How are you?

99
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,032
It's good to see you.
Nicole, this is Tiki Pot.

100
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,881
Tiki is my partner in this new series.

101
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,027
He knows a lot about porn.

102
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,198
I need two grams.

103
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,164
We are putting the narrative
back into porn, baby.

104
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,374
Desdemona.

105
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,289
You could totally play Desdemona.

106
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,919
- Look at you. You're perfect.
- Desdemona? What the fuck?

107
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,625
Fuck, yeah! You're perfect.
Look at this. Beautiful.

108
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,710
She do anal, $2,000, one hour.

109
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,012
All right. I don't do porn, Kip.

110
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,090
- Okay. Listen, listen...
- Just let me see the H.

111
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,470
It's an Othello theme, okay?

112
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,893
The Moor comes in,
finds you in bed with one of his nurses.

113
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,020
And he fucks me in the ass, huh?

114
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,768
College student. Very clean. Brett!

115
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,937
We're putting a whole new spin
on the beast with two backs, baby.

116
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,106
<i>In fact, that's what it's called,
The Beast With Two Backs.</i>

117
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,275
I don't understand why you told me
you had some but you haven't.

118
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,488
Or "Holethello" or "Butt Holethello."

119
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,031
Show her the pipe. Huh?

120
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,825
Mmm? Mmm?

121
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,574
Tiki, that's your name?

122
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,779
Hmm?

123
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,908
Why don't you shove that in your ass
and you call me in the morning?

124
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,998
Hey, Nicole! Nicole! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

125
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,750
Slow down, slow down.
Hey, I'm sorry, all right?

126
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,588
We're tweaked. Okay? I'm sorry.

127
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,475
Hey, stick around. It's not a big deal.

128
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,760
Sit down and take
some stills for me or something.

129
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,304
What's going on with you?
I thought you were clean.

130
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,554
Now you're, like,
freaking out on me and...

131
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,385
- Oh, come on.

132
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,437
Don't cry.

133
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,601
I... I just want to get faded, Kip.

134
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,483
- I have $100. Please.
- I don't want it. No, keep it.

135
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,605
Keep it. I don't want it. Okay?

136
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,607
Listen.

137
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,821
This is the Taliban, okay?
Very heavy. Okay?

138
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,288
I can handle it.

139
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,200
I don't want you shooting this shit.
It's too heavy, all right?

140
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,623
I won't. I promise.

141
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,789
Um, I'm just going to smoke it.

142
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,756
I haven't used needles in weeks.

143
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,459
Okay. No needles.

144
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,628
And if you get a little too low,

145
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,908
you just do a little coke, okay?

146
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,510
Get yourself back up, all right?

147
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,071
- Right where you need to be.
- Okay.

148
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,806
- All right?
- Yeah.

149
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,054
- Okay, baby. Mmm-hmm.
- Thanks.

150
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,137
<i>All cany-on items

151
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,309

or under the seat in front of you.</i>

152
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,066
<i>Also, all electronic devices

153

<i>Flight attendants, take your seats.</i>

155
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,825
So what did you do last night?

156
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,413
I crashed, went straight to bed.

157
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,624
All right, here we go.

158
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,329
Engine instruments
are in the green.

159
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,960
Airspeeds alive, both sides.

160
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,792
Eighty knots, crosscheck.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,798
It's like a video game, right?

162
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:52,138
Oh! Nothing like
a little 30-knot crosswind

163
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,595
to exercise the old sphincter muscle.

164
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,020
V1.

165
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,348
And rotate.

166
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,194
We're at a positive rate.

167
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,029
Gear up.

168
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,867
Yee-hah, ride 'em, cowboy.

We've got some rough chop,
I'd say moderate to...

177
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:35,886
I'd say severe turbulence,
definitely severe turbulence.

178
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,971
No meal service today.

179
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,236
<i>Feeling all right, all right</i>

180
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,489
<i>Feeling all right</i>

181
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,745
<i>I'm not feeling too good myself</i>

182
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,917
Damn it, I'm tired of this shit.

183
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,956
- What are you doing?
- Leveling off.

184
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,004
- What?
- You see that little sliver of black

185
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,960
between those two ugly clouds?

186
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,637
That's a pocket of smooth air
squatting right over Kissimmee.

187
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,010
We're gonna thread the needle.

188
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,591
Turn us right, 30 degrees.

189
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,683
Departure, SouthJet 227,
we need to deviate 30 degrees right.

190
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,978
For weather.

191
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,773
For weather.

192
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,275
<i>SouthJet 227,
30 degrees right approved.</i>

193
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,644
<i>Report back on course.</i>

194
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,944
Oh, Lord.

195
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,029
He can't help you now, brother.

196
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,778
<i>Uh, SouthJet 227, say altitude.</i>

197
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,117
- What should I say?
- Tell him we're climbing.

198
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,957
Uh, Departure, we're leaving
niner thousand for flight level 180.

199
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,087
<i>Uh, roger, 227.</i>

200
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,835
We're approaching
our maximum airspeed.

201
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,213
You're damn right. We need the speed
to punch through this crap.

202
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,339
Just work with me.

203
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,670
You're over speeding, sir.

204
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,713
Trying to get out of this shitty air,
if that's all right with you, junior.

205
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,840
<i>SouthJet 227, Orlando,</i>

206
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,471
<i>you need to check your Mode C.</i>

207
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,352
<i>Your transponder indicates
you're descending.</i>

208
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,179
Departure, this is SouthJet 227.

209
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,641
We're experiencing some rough air,
encountering some severe downdrafts.

210
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,143
We're in our climb now. Over.

211
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,399
<i>Uh, roger, 227.</i>

212
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,775
Sir, look at your airspeed.

213
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,197
You're way too fast for this rough air!

214
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm right on the line. Settle down.

215
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,499
Come on, sweetheart, show me the sun.

216
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,886
Yeah! Aha!

217
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,014
Daylight.

218
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,725
Thank God that's over.

219
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,914
All right, turn us north.
Take us home. Your plane.

220
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,332
MY plane.

221
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,458
Margaret, I'm coming out.

222
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,400
Shit, Fran!

223
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,027
Hey, Nicole.

224
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,237
That's a nice camera.

225
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,405
You know, you're like a little ghost.

226
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,407
'Cause I never know when you're here.

227
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,538
Don't ever fucking touch my camera!
Now get out!

228
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,865
Hey! Now, as the building manager,

229
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,746
I got a legal right to enter an apartment,

230
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,378
especially if I feel
the occupant to be unwell

231
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,581
and the occupant
is not current on her rent.

232
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,249
Just give me a minute.

233
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,370
All right. I have your rent.

234
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,419
I will bring it down to you, okay?

235
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,888
Just let me take a shower.

236
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,098
You shower at my house.

237
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,428
You know, bring that money down,
we can shower together.

238
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,230
I got that good water pressure.

239
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,936
You know that.

240
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,611
You're in the perfect light there, Franny.

241
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,695
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

242
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,773
- Back up a little.
- Okay.

243
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,117
A little more.

244
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,457
All right. Okay.
That's tricky, tricky, girl.

245
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,293
So you just shower up
and come on down.

246
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,121
In your fucking dreams.

247
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,548
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Captain Whitaker.</i>

248
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,896
<i>If you look up,
you'll see me here in the forward galley.</i>

249
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,321
<i>I'll wave to you.</i>

250
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,034
<i>I want to apologize
for the bumps this morning.</i>

251
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,114
<i>Uh, evidently, Florida
doesn't like us Georgians.</i>

252
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,823
<i>Maybe it has something to do with</i>

253
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,409
<i>the beating the Bulldogs
put on the Gators last fall.</i>

254
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,455
<i>I'm going to ask you
just to stretch out and relax.</i>

255
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,085
<i>Uh, the air might get a little cranky,</i>

256
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,882
<i>so we're gonna ask that
you remain in your seats</i>

257
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,677
<i>with your seatbelts
securely fastened around you.</i>

258
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,274
<i>We won't have beverage service today,</i>

259
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,055
<i>but the flight attendants
will be going through the cabin</i>

260
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,633
<i>with water and with snacks.</i>

261
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,683
<i>We'll have you
on the ground in Atlanta in 40 minutes.</i>

262
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,802
<i>Thank you.</i>

263
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,228
Hey, Nicole, open up!

264
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,030
Oh, fuck, Nicole, I know you're in there!

265
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,305
I can smell that shit cooking!

266
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,610
You better not
be burning down my fucking building!

267
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,547
How can anybody
sleep like that?

268
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,421
I don't know.

269
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,261
And how long has
Sleeping Beauty been out?

270
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,299
Um, twenty-six minutes.

271
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,419
We're gonna
start descending any second now.

272
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,348
Well, looks like
you'll need to wake him up.

273
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,135
<i>SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.</i>

274
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,134
<i>Descend and maintain flight level 300.</i>

275
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,435
Descend and maintain
flight level 300, SouthJet 227.

276
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,400
Whoa!

277
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,734
Whoa! What is that?

278
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,406
The elevator feels really stiff, sir.

279
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,778
All right, don't force it.

280
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,368
All right. Margaret,
get everybody strapped in.

281
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,569
That came from the back.

282
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,933
Get everybody strapped in tight.

283
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,995
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

284
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,496
It's pulling left hard, sir.

285
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,919
Oh!

286
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,005
Power back. Power back!

287
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,962
<i>Sink rate. Pull up.</i>

288
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,347
<i>Sink rate. Pull up.</i>

289
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,850
Ladies and gentlemen,
fasten your seatbelts now.

290
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,186
<i>Fasten your seatbelts securely now!</i>

291
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,808
I have no control on my side.

292
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,934
No control at all, sir.

293
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,266
We've lost hydraulics.

294
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,021
Center, this is SouthJet 227.

295
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,229
We've lost our hydraulics
and it feels like our pitch control.

296
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,792
<i>SouthJet 227, Atlanta...</i>

297
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,982
Turn on the backup pumps.
The backup pumps.

298
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,034
That is affirm.
We are in an uncontrolled...

299
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,581
<i>SouthJet 227, Atlanta.
Say your intentions.</i>

300
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,790
<i>Are you declaring an emergency?</i>

301
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,467
Everybody's belted in.
Are we going down?

302
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,459
Get belted in.

303
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,536
We need everybody in brace positions.

304
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,584
Yes. That is affirm. We are in a dive!

305
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,050
We are in a dive!
We have lost vertical control.

306
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,376
We're gonna need drag.

307
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,753
I want you to throw out
everything you got,

308
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,439
the speed brakes, the gear, everything.

309
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,010
Gear! Speed brakes!

310
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,229
Brace position.

311
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,478
<i>Head down! Bend forward!
Head down, bend forward!</i>

312
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,017
Uh, gear's down.

313
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,317
I don't think hydraulics
is the problem, sir.

314
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,145
We need to dump the fuel. Do it!

315
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,735
All right.

316
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,070
Atlanta Center, this is SouthJet 227.

317
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,498
We're in an uncontrolled dive
descending out of 21,000 feet.

318
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,246
We're declaring an emergency.

319
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,417
We've dumped our fuel.

320
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,291
We've got a jammed
stabilizer or something.

321
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,413
We need a block
of altitude to work the problem

322
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,170
and a heading to the nearest airport.

323
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,408
<i>SouthJet 227...</i>

324
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,168
Ah, I can't hold it. Dump the flaps.

325
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,503
- Dump the flaps.
- We're still fast.

326
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,427
- Just do it. Do it. Thirty degrees.

327
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,068
<i>Turn left, heading 315.</i>

328
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,763
315, we'll try our best.

329
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,344
All right, that bought us a little time.

330
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,586
That bought us a little time.

331
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,016
Now we got to revert to manual control.

332
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,097
Your side first.

333
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,515
Okay, got it.

334
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,272
Nothing. No control.

335
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,070
Oh, no, we're diving again!

336
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,273
<i>Pull up. Sink rate.</i>

337
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,608
Damn it.

338
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,193
All right. Okay, okay, look.

339
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,476
I can't let go of my side.
See if you can reach my side.

340
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,448
I can't reach it, sir.

341
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,533
Just... No, stay strapped in.
Stay strapped in.

342
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,126
Margaret! Margaret!

343
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,545
Oh, God.

344
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,882
We're out of 15,000.

345
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,880
God, Whip, what's happening?

346
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,337
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

347
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,940
Get strapped into the jump seat there.

348
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,055
I need you to do something for me.

349
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,474
We're at 129!

350
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,989
<i>SouthJet 227, Atlanta.</i>

351
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,643
<i>- Fuel dump is approved.
- Thank you.</i>

352
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,477
Cami!

353
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,233
Cami! Sit back down!

354
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,481
No, Cami, sit down!

355
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,984
<i>I see
you're going below 10,000.</i>

356
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,655
<i>- How are you doing?
- Uh, not good. Not good.</i>

357
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,989
Margaret, there's a red lever
right there next to my seat.

358
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,914
It says "manual control." You see it?

359
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,082
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

360
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,581
On the count of three,
I want you to pull it up,

361
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,333
turn it clockwise, push it back down.

362
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,840
Ready? One, two, three.

363
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,506
Oh, God.

364
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,587
That's okay, it's okay.

365
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,506
Ahhh, come on.

366
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,182
All right, okay, okay, okay.

367
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,680
Here we go. We got something.

368
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,057
- Ahhh!
- Shit!

369
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,937
Cami! Cami!

370
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,518
Margaret!

371
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,942
Oh, Lord,
we're coming out at 7,000!

372
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,568
I see nothing but houses!

373
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,115
Evans! Listen to me.

374
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,871
When I say I want you
to retract the flaps,

375
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,950
retract the gear,
trim us nose down, okay?

376
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,281
But everything's gonna be opposite,

377
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,365
so make sure you trim us nose down.

378
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,871
Wait, trim down?
What are you going to do?

379
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,959
- Margaret.
- Yeah.

380
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,287
When I tell you I want you
to push these forward,

381
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,712
full power, full throttle. Can you do that?

382
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,789
Yeah. Okay.

383
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:30,873
- Okay, when I tell you.
- Wait, wait, sir.

384
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,250
What are we doing?
Why would I trim down?

385
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,755
We're going to roll it, okay?

386
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:34,957
What do you mean "Roll it"?

387
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,521
We gotta do something
to stop this dive.

388
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,006
Margaret, what's your son's name?

389
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,807
- Trevor.
- Say, "I love you, Trevor."

390
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:40,883
- What?
- Black box.

391
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,006
Say, "I love you, Trevor."

392
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,645
I love you, Trevor.
You be a good boy. Mommy loves you.

393
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,893
Okay, here we go. I've got control.

394
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,689
Oh, Lord Jesus!

395
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,155
- All right, Evans, flaps.
- Flaps!

396
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,525
- Speed brakes.
- Speed brakes!

397
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,244
Margaret! Power!

398
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,082
- Gear up.
- Gear up!

399
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,100
Jesus, fuck!

400
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,434
Shit!

401
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,441
Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!

402
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,048
We're flying. Listen, we're level.

403
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,607
We can maintain altitude like this.

404
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,201
SouthJet 227,
<i>Atlanta Center. I see your position.</i>

405
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,779
<i>Four and a half miles
southeast of the airport at 1, 800.</i>

406
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,863
<i>Are you okay?</i>

407
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,120
Atlanta Center, this is
SouthJet 227. We are inverted.

408
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,709
I repeat, we are inverted.

409
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,374
<i>SouthJet 227, uh,
did you say inverted?</i>

410
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,693
We're losing oil pressure!

411
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,786
Pump failure, both engines!

412
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,257
We're all right. We're flying.

413
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,588
Come on, baby.

414
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,266
Oh, my God. Please.

415
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,279
- Fire in the left engine!
- Put it out.

416
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,643
I'm right here.
Look at me, I'm right here.

417
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,399
Atlanta, SouthJet 227,
where's that airport?

418
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,906
<i>227, it's one o'clock, three miles.</i>

419
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,159
All right. We're not gonna make that.
Our engines are burning up.

420
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,153
I see a field and a road ahead of us.

421
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,478
We're gonna set it down there.

422
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,771
<i>- Roger, 227.</i>

423
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,825
Oh, no, fire in the right now!

424
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,501
Evans,
we're coming back around.

425
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,169
Margaret, I want you to hit full power.

426
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,708
Full throttle, you understand?

427
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,172
Here we go.

428
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,504
Evans, speed brakes.

429
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,834
Speed brakes!

430
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,586
- Flaps full.
- Flaps full!

431
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,014
Cami!

432
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,972
Oh, my God.

433
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,048
We're losing the left engine.

434
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,866
<i>SouthJet 227,
I see you descending through 1,000.</i>

435
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:03,943
<i>Do you concur?</i>

436
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,285
Margaret, full power.

437
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,865
We lost the left engine!

438
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,212
Let it roll.

439
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,134
We're losing power in the right!

440
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,177
We lost all power!

441
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,742
<i>Too low. Terrain.</i>

442
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,555
<i>Too low. Terrain.</i>

443
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,727
<i>Too low. Terrain.</i>

444
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,145
Are we gliding?

445
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,848
<i>Too low. Terrain.</i>

446
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,233
We're gliding. Pitch for glide.

447
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,227
<i>Too low. Terrain.</i>

448
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,404
<i>One hundred.</i>

449
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,327
<i>Fifty.</i>

450
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,914
<i>Forty.</i>

451
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,328
<i>Thirty.</i>

452
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,167
<i>- Twenty.</i>

453
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,090
<i>- Brace.</i>
<i>- Ten. Minimums.</i>

454
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,508
<i>- Brace for impact.
- Minimums.</i>

455
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,854
I got the pilot!

456
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,401
Somebody give me a hand here!

457
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,776
Oh, my God!

458
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,074
Charlie Anderson?

459
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,416
- Hey.
- Hey.

460
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,415
How you feeling, Whip?

461
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,588
Initial reports look like you pulled
some kind of move up there, man.

462
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,544
You saved a lot of lives.

463
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,055
How many?

464
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,760
The 102 souls on board,
including the flight crew,

465
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,890
96 of them survived the crash.

466
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,390
Six people died.

467
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,726
Two crew, four passengers.

468
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,738
Who on the crew?

469
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,907
Uh, listen, the protocol is...

470
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,325
Who on the crew, Charlie?

471
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,203
The protocol is
that the NTSB has to be the first

472
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,750
to make contact with you. I can't...

473
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,578
And that agent's here, so

474
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,082
let me go get him. It's a bit of a show.

475
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,259
So, just... There's half a dozen of them.

476
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,090
All right?

477
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,599
Hey, Craig, come on in.

478
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,819
Captain William Whitaker?

479
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,656
Nod if you can hear me
and understand me.

480
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,655
I'm Craig Matson from the NT... NTSB.

481
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,658
And I am required
as the lead on the Go Team

482
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,084
to make initial contact with you

483
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,330
after a major incident
like the one you had today.

484
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,504
You are in a hospital in South Atlanta.

485
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,509
Are you aware that
the plane you were piloting went down?

486
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,095
I have a doctor here who can explain
your medical situation.

487
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,351
I'm Dr. Kenan.

488
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,525
And the good news is
you're in good condition.

489
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,763
You did suffer a concussion,

490
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,862
you have numerous lacerations
around your left eye.

491
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,360
We're going to
keep the patch on for a few days.

492
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,949
Just as a precaution.

493
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,867
Your eye seems to be okay.

494
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,121
Now, the MRI's show
that you have some strained tendons

495
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,869
in your left knee and ankle,

496
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
and you have no broken bones.

497
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,290
But you have some
deep bruising in your left thigh

498
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,872
and some torn ligaments
in your left wrist.

499
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,836
Nothing serious.

500
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,963
So, as soon as we clear
your concussion

501
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,715
and you feel well enough,
you can go home.

502
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,844
That may take a day,
maybe three. Okay?

503
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,352
I won't ask too much of you tonight,

504
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:12,232
but as I said, the NTSB is
required to make initial contact.

505
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,903
How much do you remember
about the flight?

506
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,570
Um, I remember, uh...

507
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,409
I remember everything up till the crash.

508
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,833
Okay.

509
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,911
Mr. Whitaker, that's fine.

510
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,298
I am required
to inform you that this incident

511
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,088
did result in the loss of life.

512
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,595
The current information states that

513
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,512
of the 102 souls on board, we lost six.

514
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,935
Two crew members
and four passengers.

515
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,354
Fifty-nine people
were treated and released,

516
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,601
37 people remain...

517
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,766
Who did we lose on the crew?

518
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,776
The two flight attendants,

519
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,321
Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.

520
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,735
The rep from your pilots' union,

521
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,115
Mr. Anderson, will be
our contact for you.

522
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,199
It's important that
you follow your union's guidance

523
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,033
on press and media.

524
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,291
The pilots' union works
closely with the NTSB.

525
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,293
So, I'm going to head out.

526
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,716
I'll turn this off.

527
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,964
- Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.
- Thank you.

528
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,815
I knew Trina Marquez. She was, um...

529
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,982
We spent some time together.

530
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,814
Yeah, apparently,
she wasn't strapped in.

531
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,694
A survivor reported
she was assisting a kid.

532
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,662
Margaret Thomason, how's she doing?

533
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,240
Broken collarbone, just, I mean, cuts.

534
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,417
I mean, she's banged up, but she's...

535
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,335
She's here, too. She's fine.

536
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,712
And Ken Evans, your copilot,

537
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,050
he took a bad shot to the head.

538
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,095
And they're keeping him in a coma
just to let the brain swelling go down,

539
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,513
but we feel good about him.

540
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,804
He's going to be okay.

541
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,520
What are you doing here, Charlie?

542
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,475
I'm flying a desk now.

543
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,777
I'm a rep for the pilots' union.

544
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,195
You're the rep for the pilots' union?

545
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,564
Yeah, I'm one of them.
When your plane went down,

546
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,989
all the reps got a page
and I just shot up my hand,

547
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,822
'cause I know you, said I wanted to
come be the first face you'd see.

548
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,370
I'm glad you're here.

549
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,706
The union's gonna
release a statement on your behalf,

550
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,004
condolences to the families
who lost loved ones,

551
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,048
gratitude to the brave men
and women of the flight crew.

552
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,839
That's... You don't have
to worry about that.

553
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,089
And I know you and Deana have
been divorced for a while now,

554
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,886
but maybe she
and your son, Will, wanna...

555
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,892
Yeah, Knuckles, uh...

556
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,562
How old is he now?

557
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,890
Too old. Fifteen.

558
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,066
- Fifteen? Wow.
- Yeah.

559
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,604
When we were flying for Delta,
you weren't even married.

560
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,198
We're dinosaurs, Whip.

561
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,908
Do you want me to reach out to Deana?

562
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,285
And see if she and Will
want to come down...

563
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,789
No, no. I'll... I'll call them.

564
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,877
All right.

565
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,875
Well, speaking of which,
I got your phone.

566
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,083
And a whole bunch of
other personal effects from the plane.

567
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,131
Your clothes are toast.

568
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,638
Uh, do you...

569
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,726
Do you need me
to get you some stuff, or...

570
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,473
Uh, I'm okay.

571
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,268
Charlie, I'm...

572
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,769
I'm glad you came.

573
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,312
Me, too. I'm happy to be here.

574
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,945
All right, well, I'm going to...

575
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,153
I'll let you get some rest.
But I'll come back.

576
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,491
I mean, you're going
to see plenty of me.

577
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,955
I'm sure you will.

578
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,168
The plane was fucked, Charlie.
It was doomed.

579
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,796
I know.

580
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,504
And the way you landed that plane
was nothing short of a miracle.

581
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,843
Know that.

582
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,759
Okay, man?

583
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,465
All right, cowboy.

584
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,896
God. Damn.

585
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,373
God damn it.

586
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,359
I'm on the list, baby girl. Mr. Mays.

587
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,615
Harling.

588
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,954
If this is going to
turn into a sponge bath,

589
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,202
I'll come back later.

590
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,365
- Sir.
- It's okay.

591
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,832
That's all right, honey,
I'm on the list. Harling Mays.

592
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,084
Some say they "Harling" knew me.

593
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,627
Honey, could you hustle us up
a couple of daiquiris

594
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:26,875
and a cocktail weenie?

595
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,175
On second thought,
just bring the booze,

596
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,252
I brought my own weenie.

597
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,880
Oh, she's offended
and she should be.

598
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,882
I'm a pig. And I hate me.

599
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,058
That's what
we have in common, Nurse Ratched.

600
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,554
We both hate me.

601
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,939
Harling Mays.

602
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,939
Whip, what the fuck, my man?

603
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:49,774
They're saying, "Sweet Jesus,
what a stud that pilot is."

604
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,199
You're a hero, man.

605
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,278
You will never pay
for another drink as long as you live.

606
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,205
There is all kinds
of crazy news people out here.

607
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,532
It's a fucking circus, man.

608
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,459
Come on, check this shit out, man.
It's all for you.

609
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,253
Look at this shit.

610
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,460
Classic hero worship shit.

611
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,589
You're a rock star, man.
Oh, check out this video.

612
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,878
This is outside your condo. It's a zoo.

613
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,134
It's crawling with reporters.

614
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,639
Let's see. Check this out.

615
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,301
<i>So you do know Captain Whitaker.
You are friends.</i>

616
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,219
<i>Oh, yeah. Yes, he's my brother.</i>

617
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,646
That's me
and that's Mark Mellon,

618
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,063
you know, that douchey talking haircut
from local Atlanta Channel 12.

619
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,735
I said a few words, you know,
mostly straight talk.

620
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,153
Whoa.

621
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,651
You okay, Captain Whitaker?

622
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,490
The meds they're giving me,
they're messing me up.

623
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,451
I'm all shaky and dried out,
I can't sleep good.

624
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,996
Meds? What the hell
kind of meds are they giving you?

625
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,831
Alprazolam?

626
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,616
That's generic Xanax.

627
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,164
Hydrocodone, that's generic Vicodin.
It's shit.

628
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,959
Probably Canadian.
We don't want this shit.

629
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,583
We want the premium stuff,
the blue label,

630
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,918
not this fucking well shit.

631
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,923
I mean,
where's the dihydromorphinone?

632
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,122
Or at least some
fucking Palladone, for Christ's sake.

633
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,224
Is this amateur hour?
Get that doctor in here.

634
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,419
You just saved 100 people...

635
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,517
Harling!

636
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,349
- You bring my smokes?
- Yes, I did.

637
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,551
I got your fucking message,

638
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,604
and, yes,
I got your fucking smokes right here.

639
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,684
Here's a fresh carton.

640
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,061
You smoke your nuts off, champion.

641
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,773
Hell, if I was you, I'd fire up right
here in the goddamn room.

642
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,858
Here. I got you a pint of vodka,

643
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,405
I got you some Red Bulls.
You know what I'm saying?

644
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,485
I know my customer.

645
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,157
Take the vodka with you.

646
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,622
What... Take the vodka? What are you...

647
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm not drinking any more.
Take it with you.

648
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,457
I'll just tuck it...

649
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,661
- Take the fucking vodka with you.
- Okay. All right.

650
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,918
Listen, but you
got to come get me tomorrow. Okay?

651
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,967
And...

652
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,385
I want you to go by my condo,

653
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:39,216
pick me up some clothes
and my phone charger.

654
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,679
Look in my refrigerator

655
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,228
and pick up a package
that says "veal" on it.

656
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,891
- It's marked "veal."
- Veal.

657
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,310
In the freezer. It's marked "veal."

658
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,149
Done and done.
What time do you want me here?

659
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,150
I'll call you.

660
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,272
Okay. You give a mayday,

661
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,228
you're out of here in seven minutes. Oh!

662
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,114
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you some stroke mags.

663
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,199
I've been in the hospital before,
I know what you need.

664
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,032
<i>I got Juggs,
Hot MILFs in Heat, AssMasters.</i>

665
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,072
You just stroke it all day, you're a hero.

666
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,952
If I was you,

667
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,455
I'd just lay here
pulling on that thing all daylong.

668
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,629
You know what I'm saying?
There's a smile. Yes, sir.

669
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,445
Damn it.

670
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,023
Devious minds think alike.

671
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,606
Don't go.

672
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,988
I'll be quiet and just...

673
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,786
It's nice to

674
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,581
just sit and smoke with somebody.

675
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,335
Were you on that plane?

676
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,841
Yeah, I was.

677
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,297
You?

678
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,629
You must have been sitting at the back.

679
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,139
Yeah, way in the back.

680
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,512
<i>Tobacco's but an Indian weed</i>

681
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,102
<i>Grows green in the morn
Cut down in the eve</i>

682
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,355
<i>Shows our decay 'cause we are but clay</i>

683
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,814
I love the smell
of nicotine in the morning.

684
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,692
It smells like victory.

685
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,702
Can I bum one?

686
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,454
I should quit.

687
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,248
My cancer might get cancer.

688
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,090
Joke. Hmm?

689
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,505
Were you in the plane crash?

690
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,798
He was.

691
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,382
Holy shit, man! You're the fucking pilot!

692
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,182
Ha!

693
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,851
What happened up there?

694
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,559
Okay. Yeah. I'd... Mmm.

695
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,859
Tough deal, man, but you walked away.

696
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,606
Or you limped away.

697
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,943
Yeah, I'm lucky. Going home tomorrow.

698
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,523
Home?

699
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,613
Home for me is the basement.

700
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,945
They keep cancer treatment
in the basement.

701
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,996
What kind of cancer you got?

702
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,167
Fibromyxoid sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma.

703
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,710
Very rare. God chose me.

704
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,754
You believe that?

705
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,173
Fuck, yeah, bitch.

706
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,751
You're a stupid fucker
if you don't believe in God.

707
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,345
Once you realize all the random
events in your life are God,

708
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,764
you will live a much easier life.

709
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,425
We spend all our time
trying to control all these things

710
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,227
that happen to us, it's bullshit.

711
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,388
The plane you're flying goes down?

712
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,518
Out of your control.

713
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,441
God gives you cancer?
I got no control over that.

714
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,817
Did God give me cancer?

715
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,861
You bet your ass God gave me cancer.

716
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,029
You know, do you think

717
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,105
God would have
given me cancer if I'd asked for it?

718
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,487
Uh, I don't think so,

719
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,365
'cause I begged him
to take it away and guess what?

720
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,156
No control over that, either.

721
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,034
What are you doing here, honey?

722
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,481
You're beautiful, you know that?

723
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,422
Do I scare you?

724
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:45,258
People are either drawn to me,
or they pretend like they can't see me.

725
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,964
It's a trip.

726
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,762
They think because
I'm close to the other side,

727
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,010
I got some sort of power or wisdom.

728
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,720
Like I got all the answers.

729
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,555
I don't know, maybe I do.

730
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,268
Death gives you perspective.
It all makes sense, somehow.

731
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,154
And I just can't get over
how beautiful you are.

732
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,275
I can see your arm. Are you an addict?

733
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,116
Yeah.

734
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,122
What's your name?

735
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,458
Nicole.

736
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:17,995
What do you do in the world, Nicole?

737
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,463
Not much.

738
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,963
I was a photographer,
and then I was a masseuse,

739
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,137
and now I sometimes
wash hair in a salon.

740
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,297
Oh, yeah? Where is it?

741
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,831
I'm gonna come by. I'm real easy,
you just wash my head.

742
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,976
You think you're going to die?

743
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,448
Don't you just love her?

744
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,954
Don't know her.

745
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,498
Bullshit. I do.

746
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,252
Random act of God? I don't think so.

747
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,256
You survive a plane crash
to meet a beautiful woman in a stairwell.

748
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,176
Fuck you, man.

749
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,511
Probably looking for me.

750
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,888
My family just flew in from Utah.

751
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,353
You know it's bad
when they start flying in.

752
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,517
Hmm.

753
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,478
It's a trip.

754
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,189
'Cause every morning is special now.

755
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,525
I'm grateful for that.

756
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,862
I wish I could bottle
this feeling that I have

757
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,195
about how beautiful
every last breath of life is.

758
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,371
Mmm. You think I could get one more,
just for the road?

759
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,502
Here. Take the pack.

760
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,543
Mmm!

761
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,209
Thank you.

762
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,795
I'll pass these out
in the cancer ward. Mmm.

763
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,349
Nicole. You're going to be okay.

764
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,270
Chemo brain.

765
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,235
Makes you pretty foggy.

766
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,645
Oh, yeah?

767
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,401
They call it chemo brain.

768
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,572
My momma, she used
to slur her words and get all chatty.

769
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,741
Your mom had cancer?

770
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,407
Breast cancer. She was only 54.

771
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,085
Is that why you think you're going to die?

772
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,667
Heroin addicts who use needles,
they tend to die.

773
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,090
Especially women, for some reason.

774
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,429
I read that in a pamphlet.

775
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,927
A woman from AA, she just came
to see me whilst I was in rehab.

776
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,098
That guy was a trip, huh?

777
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,770
Yeah.

778
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,897
He made it feel like, I don't know.

779
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,773
Like you and me
were the last people left on this planet.

780
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,782
And together we'll save the world.

781
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,008
Where do you live, Nicole?

782
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,800
Why? You want to come visit me?
It's luxurious.

783
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,807
I live in Bankhead, near the bus station.

784
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,475
I'll come visit you.

785
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,432
- You're sweet.
- I will.

786
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,139
What's your address?

787
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,817
I live at the Georgian Terraces,
on Taylor Street.

788
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,065
Okay.

789
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,781
And you say you're a masseuse?
What kind of masseuse?

790
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,986
I've been every kind
of masseuse there is.

791
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,285
Good luck, Nicole.

792
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,748
I couldn't find any suitcases.

793
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,271
I put all your shit in garbage bags.

794
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,675
No, thanks.

795
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,178
You're staying with me
down on University, right?

796
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,180
It's nice.

797
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,061
A lot of young people. Good vibe.

798
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,348
No, I'm going to the farm.

799
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,025
Farm?

800
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,524
I can't stay at my condo.

801
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,128
I thought you sold your dad's place.

802
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,315
Not yet.

803
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,491
I'm not sure I want to stay at the farm.

804
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,776
You're not.
You're just gonna drive me to the airport

805
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,408
so I can pick up my car.

806
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,706
"Veal"?

807
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,671
- Really.

808
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,123
<i>Captain Whitaker, this is
Jim Court, I'm with CNN. We'd like...</i>

809
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,169
<i>This is the NBC affiliate
in Athens. We're looking to...</i>

810
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,925
<i>In the wake of the deadly
crash of SouthJet ﬂight 227,</i>

811
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,676
<i>we have more questions than answers</i>

812
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,549
<i>as to what exactly happened that day.</i>

813
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,805
<i>And like many,
we are out looking for answers.</i>

814
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,609
<i>Looking here at the home of pilot
Captain William "Whip" Whitaker.</i>

815
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,231
<i>We still have no sighting
and no comments</i>

816
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,432
<i>from the Captain himself.</i>

817
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:03,520
<i>This is Mark Mellon, still on the hunt,
from midtown Atlanta.</i>

818
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,067
<i>You've reached
the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company,</i>

819
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,989
<i>ﬂying lessons and plane rides.</i>

820
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,239
<i>Please leave a message
and it will be returned. Thank you.</i>

821
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,702
<i>Hey, cowboy. It's Charlie again.</i>

822
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,752
<i>Listen, I'm back in town
and I stopped by the hospital tonight,</i>

823
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,625
<i>but they said you'd gone home,</i>

824
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,923
<i>so you must be feeling pretty good.</i>

825
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,669
Uh, listen, I went out to your condo

826
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,591
and the manager said
you had not returned,

827
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,844
so you may be with relatives,
which I understand,

828
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,641
but I know you have
a doctor's appointment

829
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,094
early in the morning for your eye,

830
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,020
and I was just hoping
that you could meet us for breakfast.

831
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:42,767
About 10:00 at the St. Regis,
there's an executive buffet there.

832
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,566
And we'll be
covering some pretty important stuff,

833
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,523
so it'd be nice to have you there.

834
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,779
All right. Be good.

835
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,801
Oh, there he is.

836
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,808
Hey, Whip. Hey, buddy.
Man, you look good.

837
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:20,888
I feel good.

838
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,972
Thanks for coming.
Glad you got my message.

839
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,558
- How's your eye?
- Good, good.

840
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,814
This is Hugh Lang,
he's an attorney from Chicago.

841
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,395
- Pleasure to meet you, Captain.
- My pleasure.

842
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,759
- Sit down. You want a coffee?
- Uh, yes, I do.

843
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,074
- Could we have some fresh coffee?
- Yes, sir.

844
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,323
We were just talking
about your copilot's wife.

845
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,247
Told a newspaper that
"God landed that plane."

846
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,662
Yeah? Oh, God landed that plane?

847
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,618
Well, I do believe God landed the plane.

848
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,294
Same way I believe
God should hit the buffet,

849
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,247
the turkey sausage is excellent.

850
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,170
I'm fine with coffee, thank you.

851
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,759
So, Len Caldwell
really wanted to get here this morning.

852
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,086
Len's the president of the pilots' union.

853
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,342
He wanted to be here
to meet with us and you,

854
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,594
but they need him at the crash site.

855
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,676
As you know, when a plane goes down,

856
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,854
the NTSB sends a Go Team
to the crash site immediately.

857
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,681
They find the flight data recorder?

858
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:04,936
They did. It's perfectly intact.

859
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,107
Oh, great. Great, great, great.

860
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,435
Then that solves everything.

861
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,863
So why do we need
a lawyer from Chicago?

862
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:14,408
Well, Hugh specializes
in criminal negligence.

863
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,372
- Criminal negligence?
- Mmm-hmm.

864
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,737
Death demands responsibility.

865
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,869
Six dead on that plane,
someone has to pay.

866
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,493
Yeah, but that's a plane
that fell apart at...

867
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,418
Thank you. Fell apart at 30,000 feet.

868
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,005
The airline will try
to prove equipment failure,

869
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,753
which is gonna make
the manufacturer responsible.

870
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,675
The manufacturer in turn
is gonna try and prove

871
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,923
poor maintenance
of the equipment by the airline.

872
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,629
Or pilot error.

873
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,759
I flew the plane inverted,
that means upside down, Hugh.

874
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,556
- Hmm.
- You get the picture? A hundred people,

875
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,263
upside down, 500 feet off the ground.

876
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,973
Do you have any idea what that's like?

877
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,900
I do. I heard the black box
recordings last night.

878
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,728
Oh, you heard. Are you a pilot?

879
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:51,778
No, I'm not.

880
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,697
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, do you?

881
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,772
Hugh's on our team, Whip.

882
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,987
- Is he?
- Yeah, he is.

883
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,443
- He doesn't act like he's on our team.
- Well, he is.

884
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,073
Asking me questions
about fucking pilot error.

885
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,746
Listen, it's the NTSB's ball game.

886
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,243
They run the investigation.

887
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,495
And they will ultimately
rule on the cause.

888
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,742
And that's why we need him.

889
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:08,249
Well, they interview
the entire flight crew.

890
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:13,084
They interview the passengers.
They hold public hearings.

891
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,419
All right, let's cut to the chase.

892
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,253
Just tell me
what it is I need to know, Charlie.

893
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:21,388
The NTSB Go Team also collects
blood, hair and skin samples

894
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:25,517
from the entire flight crew for
the purposes of a toxicology report.

895
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,140
Okay. When do they want to do that?

896
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,143
They've already done that.
In the hospital.

897
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,978
It's the first thing they do.

898
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,486
You don't remember having
your blood drawn the night of the crash?

899
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:37,908
- No.
- No.

900
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,203
They get the results of this test?

901
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,079
Yeah, they do.

902
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,290
Anything else for you gentlemen?

903
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,168
Yeah. You had
warm cinnamon buns over there, right?

904
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,248
Yes, sir.

905
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,458
- Could you get me one of those, please?
- Sure.

906
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,662
In fact, get me two of them.

907
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,044
- Yes, sir. Coming up.
- Thank you, sweetie.

908
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,427
Now, an initial report shows that

909
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,058
you had alcohol in your system

910
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,936
at a level of .24.

911
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,309
Now in the good old U.S. of A.,

912
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,312
one of the most lenient
drunk driving countries in the world,

913
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,736
you go to jail for driving
with anything above .08.

914
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,606
- And by driving, I mean a car.
- Mmm.

915
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,525
Thank you.

916
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,112
Uh... So... That doesn't mean anything.

917
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,992
I had a couple of beers
the night before the flight.

918
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,790
That made the tail of the plane explode?

919
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,084
- A couple of beers?
- Yeah, a couple of beers.

920
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,794
You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie.

921
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,371
- Hugh is your lawyer.
- I need a bigger lawyer.

922
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,298
I need a lawyer that understands
that someone put me in a broken plane.

923
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:38,298
Without me up there, there would have
been 102 funerals, not six.

924
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,004
We're not talking
about funerals right now, Captain.

925
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,213
Well, then what are we talking about?

926
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,094
We're talking about prison time.

927
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,766
- What?
- Lawsuits.

928
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,470
- Somebody has to pay.
- What, write a check?

929
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,271
It's not gonna be me, I promise you that.

930
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,187
As long as they're writing checks,
tell them to write one for me, too.

931
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,064
Because someone put me
in a broken plane.

932
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,519
I'd love a check, Charlie.

933
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,481
This toxicology report
states that you were drunk

934
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,983
and high on cocaine.

935
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,945
Felonies punishable by
up to 12 years in prison.

936
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,372
And if it is proven that your intoxication

937
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,289
was the cause of the death
of the four passengers,

938
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,164
now we're gonna look at
four counts of manslaughter.

939
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,579
That could be life in prison.

940
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,633
Now can I please
do my job on your behalf

941
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,335
and kill this tox report?

942
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,601
He's gonna get it done, Whip.
He'll get it done.

943
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,053
It's what his whole life's about.

944
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,434
Trust me. Trust him.

945
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,392
You don't have to worry,
you'll walk away from this the hero.

946
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,148
I'm not worried, Charlie.

947
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,564
I promise you that I'm not worried.

948
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,696
No one could have landed
that plane like I did.

949
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,328
No one.

950
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,415
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

951
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,916
Excuse me.

952
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,917
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

953
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,344
Yeah, let me have an orange juice.

954
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,762
Large orange juice.

955
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,680
Just orange juice?

956
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,850
Yeah, uh, no. Uh...

957
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,346
Double Stoli. Neat.

958
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,015
<i>It paints a picture to me anyway</i>

959
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,851
<i>of a real American hero.
Is that your reading of it?</i>

960
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:22,281
<i>Absolutely. However,
remember, every situation is different.</i>

961
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,027
<i>And the actions of
the pilots on SouthJet 227</i>

962
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,531
<i>will be heavily scrutinized.</i>

963
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:28,954
<i>Are you suggesting that</i>

964
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,656
<i>there may be more to this
than meets the eye?</i>

965
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:31,865
<i>There always is.</i>

966
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,326
<i>You don't have all the answers.</i>

967
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,660
<i>You do have a lot of questions.</i>

968
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:36,871
<i>We're gonna have to wait until some
of those answers come in</i>

969
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,877
<i>before we can say much more.</i>

970
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,008
<i>Are you hinting here,
I don't want to put words in your mouth,</i>

971
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,928
<i>but are you hinting
that this is suspicious?</i>

972
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,177
<i>This accident is
not like any other accident.</i>

973
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,318
Ah.

974
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,879
And the next one will be

975
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,764
Taylor Street.

976
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,302
Ah, Taylor Street.

977
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,647
What the fuck, Nicole?

978
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,061
Get out!

979
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,693
The guy in unit 1
just told me you stayed here last night!

980
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,156
Franny, just relax.

981
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,695
I just want to get my shit out of here.

982
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,244
What about my rent?
You owe me money, bitch!

983
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,321
Don't touch me, Franny!

984
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,658
Fran, get off me.
Fran, get your hand off me!

985
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,914
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the fuck off her!

986
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,246
Keep your fucking hands off her!

987
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,337
Oh.

988
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,802
You okay?

989
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,007
Is this all the rest of your stuff?

990
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,341
Uh, yeah.

991
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,392
She still owes me $1,100!

992
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,936
- Plus damages!
- Shut up!

993
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,266
What, you want to sue her?

994
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,605
Spend 1,000 bucks, or you want to
make a cash deal with me?

995
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,061
Make up your mind.

996
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,025
Make up your mind!

997
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,321
I'll take 700 cash.

998
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,115
You're a hairy little creep, aren't you?

999
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,573
Some baseball bat bullshit.

1000
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,166
Seven hundred, my ass.

1001
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,213
There's 400 cash.

1002
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,257
Now be a good boy,

1003
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,127
grab that box and put it in her car.

1004
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,505
Uh, my car, it don't run.

1005
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,842
It didn't start this morning.
I'm taking all this with me.

1006
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,968
- Your car doesn't run?
- Mmm-mmm.

1007
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,603
Well, what were you going to do?

1008
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,685
Why...

1009
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,771
I don't know what I was gonna do.

1010
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,425
What's your name?

1011
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,218
Whip.

1012
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,019
- What?

1013
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,269
That's funny?

1014
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,281
Thank you,

1015
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,068
Captain Whip.

1016
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,673
Hey.

1017
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,043
You Okay?

1018
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,969
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

1019
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,973
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.

1020
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,019
You sure it's all right that I stay here?

1021
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,810
Yes, it's all right that you stay here.

1022
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,271
I want you to stay.

1023
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,687
That knee hurting you?

1024
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,987
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1025
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,411
Oh. Thank you, Doctor.

1026
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,671
- it's throbbing a little bit.
- Yeah.

1027
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:32,257
The blood's having
a hard time getting back to your heart.

1028
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,458
Hmm.

1029
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,511
Ooh.

1030
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,760
Feels good, though.

1031
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,364
Hmm.

1032
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,428
You going to shoot me?
Or can I come inside?

1033
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,928
Yeah, come on inside.
I'll shoot you inside.

1034
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,184
Listen, I thought we'd take a ride.

1035
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,747
There's something I need to show you.

1036
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,447
Okay.

1037
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,113
- There it is.

1038
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:32,457
You can see on initial impact,
the left wing hit the ground.

1039
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,963
Think if it would have
sheared off completely,

1040
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,708
everybody would have
walked away from this plane.

1041
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:42,638
The wing snapped off
and drove the engine cowling into

1042
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,969
- the rear fuselage.
- Yeah.

1043
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,093
If you were sitting
in the last six or seven rows,

1044
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,474
it was like being hit by a train.

1045
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,563
Who are they?

1046
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,650
The John the Baptist
Pentecostal Mission.

1047
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,857
They helped pull survivors
out of the wreckage.

1048
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,570
Now, they come out here every day.

1049
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,166
And that is Ellen Block.

1050
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,745
She's the head
of the NTSB investigation.

1051
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,923
She's the one that's gonna be asking
you the tough questions.

1052
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,590
I drank the night before the flight.

1053
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:20,838
I drank that morning, too.

1054
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,511
I used cocaine to help
straighten myself out.

1055
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:26,301
I know. It's in the toxicology report.

1056
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,134
But that is
not the reason why this happened.

1057
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,345
No, it's not.

1058
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:33,938
Listen.

1059
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,271
Clearly, there was a mechanical issue
with the plane.

1060
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,350
Yeah, clearly.

1061
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,648
Yeah, but what you and I know,
this was an act of God.

1062
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,410
And I'm going to fight to get
the NTSB to add "Act of God"

1063
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,362
as one of the probable causes.

1064
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,206
Whose god would do this?

1065
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,257
Okay.

1066
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,088
So,

1067
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,546
here's the deal.

1068
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,804
Avington Carr, he's the owner
of the airline, he's on our side.

1069
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,011
He's got big friends in Washington, too.

1070
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,559
He wants to have a sit-down with us
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

1071
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,565
- Good.
- Yeah.

1072
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,902
You can't drink, Captain.

1073
01:06:22,268 --> 01:06:23,861
You're under the microscope right now.

1074
01:06:23,937 --> 01:06:25,860
You can't be seen buying liquor.

1075
01:06:25,939 --> 01:06:28,442
That means no bars, no drugs...

1076
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:31,074
I understand.
I won't drink, I promise you.

1077
01:06:31,444 --> 01:06:33,196
- Look, we can get you help...
- I don't need help.

1078
01:06:33,279 --> 01:06:37,125
I won't drink, I promise you.
I can stop. On my own.

1079
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:40,453
- Okay.
- Okay.

1080
01:06:44,457 --> 01:06:46,801
- Till 10:00.
- 10:00, I got it.

1081
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,462
Avington Carr.

1082
01:06:48,962 --> 01:06:51,431
I never wanted that fucking airline.

1083
01:06:51,506 --> 01:06:54,726
Neither did my brother.
It was my father that wanted it.

1084
01:06:54,842 --> 01:06:57,391
- I like baseball.
- Oh, I like baseball.

1085
01:06:57,512 --> 01:06:59,059
Everybody in Georgia likes baseball.

1086
01:06:59,138 --> 01:07:00,560
The whole country likes baseball.

1087
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,857
Cut the crap.

1088
01:07:02,976 --> 01:07:05,695
So, what's the deal, Lenny?

1089
01:07:05,812 --> 01:07:08,156
Is your union going to survive this one?

1090
01:07:08,314 --> 01:07:11,534
More importantly, how big a check
you think I'm gonna have to write?

1091
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:13,991
Oh, you had six fatalities
on board your aircraft.

1092
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:15,413
No, no, it's four, Lenny.

1093
01:07:15,488 --> 01:07:17,707
Uh, the two crew members don't count.

1094
01:07:18,908 --> 01:07:21,252
I don't mean they don't count.

1095
01:07:21,327 --> 01:07:23,455
They don't get settlements
like the passengers.

1096
01:07:23,538 --> 01:07:26,917
Okay, that's a workman's comp claim,
part of the union contract.

1097
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,503
They do a dangerous job. They know it.

1098
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:32,631
You the lawyer for the pilots' union?

1099
01:07:32,714 --> 01:07:34,591
No, sir, this is Hugh Lang,

1100
01:07:34,674 --> 01:07:35,926
he's the attorney we brought on

1101
01:07:36,009 --> 01:07:38,728
to handle the criminal side
of Captain Whitaker's situation.

1102
01:07:40,346 --> 01:07:43,520
Yes, and what is
Mr. Whitaker's situation?

1103
01:07:43,725 --> 01:07:45,819
The NTSB is up my ass
with a flashlight.

1104
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:47,987
We had to give them
access to everything.

1105
01:07:48,062 --> 01:07:50,110
Everybody's curious
about Captain Whitaker.

1106
01:07:50,189 --> 01:07:53,113
Well, I flew with him
in the navy and he is a great pilot.

1107
01:07:53,192 --> 01:07:54,409
Huh.

1108
01:07:55,862 --> 01:07:57,364
Is he a drunk?

1109
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,452
He's a heavy drinker.

1110
01:08:02,535 --> 01:08:03,896
But maybe I should bring him in...

1111
01:08:03,953 --> 01:08:05,296
In a minute.

1112
01:08:05,872 --> 01:08:08,591
All right, so let's get down to it, Lenny.

1113
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:12,796
What does the union
plan to do about this blood test saying

1114
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:15,632
Whitaker was high on booze and coke?

1115
01:08:15,882 --> 01:08:17,304
This guy's a real peach.

1116
01:08:17,383 --> 01:08:20,102
I'm going to kill the toxicology report.

1117
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,473
The testing was done incompetently.

1118
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:28,687
The toxicology equipment they used
was last calibrated in June of 2009.

1119
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,148
It's already 18 months past code.

1120
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:33,657
Their log, that should clearly state

1121
01:08:33,733 --> 01:08:36,907
who labeled the blood vials,
and when, is very incomplete.

1122
01:08:37,028 --> 01:08:39,781
And they used
a preservative in the blood

1123
01:08:39,864 --> 01:08:42,663
that has been known
to cause fermentation,

1124
01:08:42,909 --> 01:08:45,833
and in some cases,
register higher in an alcohol test.

1125
01:08:45,912 --> 01:08:48,791
Now, I've done all this,
I've only been here a few days,

1126
01:08:48,873 --> 01:08:51,547
so I wouldn't worry about it
too much. I can handle this.

1127
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:54,003
I like this guy, Lenny.

1128
01:08:54,087 --> 01:08:57,466
Makes me want to go out
and sniff a few lines and fly a jet.

1129
01:08:57,548 --> 01:09:00,347
Mr. Carr,
we're going to fight to push all the fault

1130
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:02,394
onto the manufacturer,
Jackson Ridgefield.

1131
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:06,520
And you think they're gonna just open
their checkbook and buy us all lunch?

1132
01:09:06,599 --> 01:09:08,272
Good fucking luck.

1133
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,812
What's my exposure, Jim?

1134
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:14,194
Well, the awards
to the families could kill the airline.

1135
01:09:14,273 --> 01:09:15,399
Fuck the airline.

1136
01:09:15,483 --> 01:09:17,577
The insurance companies
can have the goddamn airline.

1137
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:19,905
I just don't want them
to come sniffing in my other pockets.

1138
01:09:19,987 --> 01:09:21,910
Speaking for the pilots' union, sir,

1139
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:24,208
we don't want to see
your airline go away.

1140
01:09:24,283 --> 01:09:26,377
We enjoy the contract you have with us.

1141
01:09:26,452 --> 01:09:28,125
We're gonna protect Captain Whitaker,

1142
01:09:28,246 --> 01:09:30,715
and in turn, we're gonna
protect your airline.

1143
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:34,636
Does Whitaker know he's going to jail?

1144
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:37,009
My clients don't go to jail, Mr. Carr.

1145
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:40,054
Oh, he's going to jail. He belongs in jail.

1146
01:09:40,133 --> 01:09:42,727
You bet your ass he's going to jail.
The only question is,

1147
01:09:42,802 --> 01:09:44,896
is he going to die in jail?

1148
01:09:45,138 --> 01:09:46,981
You're wrong, Mr. Carr.

1149
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:48,273
Last time I checked,

1150
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:51,228
six counts
of manslaughter is life in prison.

1151
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,983
Life in prison.

1152
01:09:53,312 --> 01:09:56,486
What we in Georgia call "all day long."

1153
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:06,709
I hear you're some kind of pilot.

1154
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:13,833
<i>To the 40, to the 50!
And touchdown!</i>

1155
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,136
<i>And Grandpa throws it, picks it up...</i>

1156
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:19,179
<i>Oh, Grandpa, what,
are you going to chase him now?</i>

1157
01:10:20,506 --> 01:10:22,053
Pick it up, Pop.

1158
01:10:22,175 --> 01:10:23,222
Pick it up.

1159
01:10:26,512 --> 01:10:28,232
<i>Run it back! Run it back!
Come on, Knuckles!</i>

1160
01:10:28,306 --> 01:10:29,432
<i>Let me see you cut.</i>

1161
01:10:33,519 --> 01:10:36,443
There she is, there she is.

1162
01:10:36,522 --> 01:10:40,527
You back... To the meet?
At the nice meeting.

1163
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:45,707
I know, it's okay.

1164
01:10:51,537 --> 01:10:54,541
Yep. That shit ain't...

1165
01:10:59,879 --> 01:11:00,926
See?

1166
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:04,266
This shit...

1167
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:06,894
And my...

1168
01:11:07,053 --> 01:11:10,478
Knuckles, he's my boy.

1169
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:14,231
He can play a game.

1170
01:11:15,895 --> 01:11:17,522
He can play that game.

1171
01:11:17,605 --> 01:11:18,652
<i>You want to run the ball!</i>

1172
01:11:18,731 --> 01:11:20,654
<i>You want to be a quarterback!
Let me see you run it back!</i>

1173
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:23,202
<i>Fake Dad out! Fake Grandpa out!</i>

1174
01:11:23,277 --> 01:11:25,075
<i>Oh, Dad, where'd you get that arm?</i>

1175
01:11:25,196 --> 01:11:27,415
<i>You must've got that
from Grandma's side.</i>

1176
01:11:38,584 --> 01:11:41,758
There's a flight.
We're gonna miss the flight.

1177
01:11:53,766 --> 01:11:56,110
<i>And he picks it up!
Tell him, Dad.</i>

1178
01:11:56,936 --> 01:11:59,359
<i>When are we going to
go flying, Dad? Soon?</i>

1179
01:11:59,438 --> 01:12:00,610
<i>Soon.</i>

1180
01:12:00,731 --> 01:12:02,529
<i>You still want to get up there?</i>

1181
01:12:02,608 --> 01:12:04,155
<i>Sure. Any time, son.</i>

1182
01:12:04,235 --> 01:12:06,078
<i>All right. Say hi, son.</i>

1183
01:12:06,153 --> 01:12:08,201
<i>All right. Where's little man Knuckles?</i>

1184
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:09,624
<i>What's up, Knuckles?</i>

1185
01:12:10,116 --> 01:12:12,084
<i>Don't get shy.
Don't act like you don't know me.</i>

1186
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,127
<i>I'm your father. Say, "Hi, Dad."</i>

1187
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:15,542
<i>- Knuckles.</i>
<i>- What's your name?</i>

1188
01:12:15,621 --> 01:12:16,713
<i>Will.</i>

1189
01:12:16,914 --> 01:12:18,275
<i>- What's your nickname?</i>
- Knuckles.

1190
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:19,338
<i>What are you gonna be
when you grow up?</i>

1191
01:12:19,417 --> 01:12:21,215
<i>- A pilot.</i>
<i>- There you go.</i>

1192
01:12:21,294 --> 01:12:23,638
<i>You taught him well, Dad. A pilot.</i>

1193
01:12:23,754 --> 01:12:26,132
<i>Wait, wait, let me get that.</i>

1194
01:12:26,465 --> 01:12:28,138
<i>- Say hi to Mom.</i>
<i>- Hi, Mom.</i>

1195
01:12:28,426 --> 01:12:30,386
<i>What do you wanna tell Mom?
Tell her you love her.</i>

1196
01:12:30,469 --> 01:12:31,470
<i>I love her.</i>

1197
01:12:54,493 --> 01:12:56,495
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1198
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:04,011
You were in pretty bad shape last night.

1199
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:05,220
Yeah.

1200
01:13:05,838 --> 01:13:08,011
Just tired. Oh!

1201
01:13:10,134 --> 01:13:12,136
I drank a little bit too much.

1202
01:13:12,511 --> 01:13:13,854
A bit?

1203
01:13:15,514 --> 01:13:17,812
What, you want to count
the fucking beers?

1204
01:13:18,351 --> 01:13:19,853
I threw them out.

1205
01:13:20,811 --> 01:13:23,030
They're in the garbage. Vodka, too.

1206
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,442
That okay with you?

1207
01:13:26,525 --> 01:13:29,278
- More than okay.
- Good.

1208
01:13:32,823 --> 01:13:36,168
I've been watching the sky
change since the sunrise.

1209
01:13:37,703 --> 01:13:39,046
Beautiful.

1210
01:13:40,206 --> 01:13:42,379
I went out there,
I took some great shots.

1211
01:13:47,713 --> 01:13:49,886
It's just so beautiful here.

1212
01:13:51,217 --> 01:13:52,844
You grow up here?

1213
01:13:53,344 --> 01:13:55,062
No. My dad did, though.

1214
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:00,519
It's my grandfather's farm.

1215
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:04,568
Was.

1216
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:09,744
Dad was a pilot.
He was 332nd Airborne.

1217
01:14:10,027 --> 01:14:11,449
He was Tuskegee.

1218
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:13,702
Built that landing strip out there.

1219
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:17,790
Crop dusting. EPA shut him down.

1220
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:19,753
He traded in the crop duster

1221
01:14:21,247 --> 01:14:23,921
for the old Cessna
sitting out there in the barn.

1222
01:14:26,585 --> 01:14:29,213
Flew that damn thing all over the place.

1223
01:14:32,925 --> 01:14:34,268
He died.

1224
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:36,600
I got a divorce and...

1225
01:14:39,265 --> 01:14:42,018
I've been trying to sell
the place ever since.

1226
01:14:44,228 --> 01:14:45,901
What about your mom?

1227
01:14:46,564 --> 01:14:47,611
Dead.

1228
01:14:50,443 --> 01:14:52,445
You? What about your dad?

1229
01:14:52,611 --> 01:14:55,615
Well, I'm pretty sure
he lives in Colorado.

1230
01:14:55,781 --> 01:14:56,907
Yeah?

1231
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,702
No relationship?

1232
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:02,462
It was my mom that raised me.

1233
01:15:02,705 --> 01:15:04,298
She was incredible.

1234
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:09,258
She held it together for so long,
I couldn't even tell how sick she was.

1235
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:14,092
We spent those last
seven months together

1236
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:16,098
- like we were teenagers.

1237
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:21,311
We'd trade stories
about boys and whatever.

1238
01:15:25,019 --> 01:15:26,896
Ah, she loved me.

1239
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:45,839
My name's Trevor.

1240
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,213
You saved my mom.

1241
01:16:01,013 --> 01:16:02,765
It's great to see you, Whip.

1242
01:16:02,848 --> 01:16:05,021
- It's good to see you, too, Margaret.

1243
01:16:10,397 --> 01:16:12,240
The service was so nice.

1244
01:16:12,358 --> 01:16:15,032
I mean, all these people
who wanted to say goodbye.

1245
01:16:16,737 --> 01:16:20,082
Trina looked so beautiful in there.
Didn't you think so?

1246
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:24,420
I mean, like she was just
going to wake up and smile.

1247
01:16:24,745 --> 01:16:27,749
I didn't go in. I... I just couldn't.

1248
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:34,430
Trevor, find Daddy, baby.
He's over there by Mr. Benton.

1249
01:16:41,595 --> 01:16:44,064
You really should come
to the counseling group.

1250
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,268
The union has great people
for us to talk to.

1251
01:16:46,392 --> 01:16:48,565
I can't. Really. I...

1252
01:16:49,603 --> 01:16:50,855
I will.

1253
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,573
Well...

1254
01:16:57,945 --> 01:16:59,913
- You take care, okay, Whip?
- Okay.

1255
01:17:00,447 --> 01:17:02,120
Listen, Margaret.

1256
01:17:03,284 --> 01:17:04,410
Uh...

1257
01:17:04,952 --> 01:17:07,296
You know I'm in the middle of this, uh,

1258
01:17:08,122 --> 01:17:11,376
investigation. The NTSB
is investigating the crash.

1259
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:13,210
Yeah. I'm gonna talk to them next week.

1260
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:16,423
Yeah. Well, I'm...
I'm a little nervous

1261
01:17:16,505 --> 01:17:21,727
because I was out the night
before the crash, at dinner.

1262
01:17:21,802 --> 01:17:23,019
Yeah. With Trina.

1263
01:17:23,095 --> 01:17:25,189
Right. And I had two glasses of wine,

1264
01:17:25,264 --> 01:17:27,767
and they're probably going to ask you

1265
01:17:27,975 --> 01:17:29,693
about my condition that morning,

1266
01:17:29,768 --> 01:17:32,863
or whether you thought
I had anything to drink.

1267
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:37,776
What?

1268
01:17:41,113 --> 01:17:43,081
I've known you 11 years, Whip.

1269
01:17:43,157 --> 01:17:44,249
Right.

1270
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:46,544
You want to tell me that
you and Trina went to dinner

1271
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:48,667
- and you had two glasses of wine?
- No.

1272
01:17:48,746 --> 01:17:50,965
Sounds like a nice restaurant.
Now, which one was it?

1273
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,010
You have to say that it was
an ordinary day, Margaret.

1274
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:55,210
I mean, it was an ordinary day.

1275
01:17:55,294 --> 01:17:57,763
You know me. I was in shape to fly.

1276
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:03,803
You have a problem with saying that?

1277
01:18:06,013 --> 01:18:07,686
It's a lie, Whip.

1278
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:11,394
It's a lie. Trina told me
you two hadn't been to sleep.

1279
01:18:11,477 --> 01:18:16,574
Well, my lack of sleep had nothing to do
with that plane falling apart, Margaret.

1280
01:18:16,649 --> 01:18:18,117
I'm just trying to get this thing straight.

1281
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:21,071
Now you think any other pilot could have
landed that plane and saved more lives?

1282
01:18:21,153 --> 01:18:22,405
I didn't say that, Whip.
I can't imagine another...

1283
01:18:22,488 --> 01:18:23,489
All right, then.

1284
01:18:23,572 --> 01:18:26,291
Well, imagine your son,
Trevor, in this church,

1285
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:27,584
looking at you in that box.

1286
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,662
Or my son visiting me in prison. And...

1287
01:18:29,745 --> 01:18:32,965
- Please, Whip, enough. Enough, Whip.
- And for the next 40 years...

1288
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,509
Don't you think we've all had enough?

1289
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:44,973
I need this, Margaret.

1290
01:18:52,476 --> 01:18:54,194
What do you want me to say?

1291
01:18:55,771 --> 01:18:57,398
I just...

1292
01:18:59,358 --> 01:19:01,281
it was an ordinary day.

1293
01:19:03,862 --> 01:19:07,207
The storm, after we took off,

1294
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:09,206
was very severe.

1295
01:19:10,703 --> 01:19:13,547
But as far as
the flight crew was concerned,

1296
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:17,176
it was a perfectly ordinary day.

1297
01:19:38,564 --> 01:19:40,237
- Hey.
- Hi.

1298
01:19:40,316 --> 01:19:41,408
Ah...

1299
01:19:43,068 --> 01:19:44,320
You Okay?

1300
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:45,913
Uh... Yeah, yeah.

1301
01:19:47,156 --> 01:19:48,408
So?

1302
01:19:48,615 --> 01:19:50,868
Well, I got through my first day.
They didn't fire me.

1303
01:19:50,951 --> 01:19:52,203
- So...
- Good. Good.

1304
01:19:53,078 --> 01:19:55,877
And they need someone to work
the night shift and they asked me.

1305
01:19:55,956 --> 01:19:57,583
It's time and a half, so...

1306
01:20:00,044 --> 01:20:01,341
I got a vest.

1307
01:20:02,254 --> 01:20:03,631
- And a little name tag.
- Nice.

1308
01:20:03,714 --> 01:20:04,715
I got you something.

1309
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:05,970
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1310
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:09,386
Oh...

1311
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:11,768
It's a P-51 Mustang.

1312
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:12,936
I know it's a P-51...

1313
01:20:13,057 --> 01:20:14,178
Your daddy fly one of those?

1314
01:20:14,224 --> 01:20:15,396
Yes, he did.

1315
01:20:16,393 --> 01:20:18,066
It's cause for celebration.

1316
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:21,740
Oh, well, I promised Sheila that
I'd go to this AA meeting now.

1317
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,238
She's my sponsor,
the one that's been helping me.

1318
01:20:24,318 --> 01:20:25,740
Can we celebrate tomorrow night?

1319
01:20:26,236 --> 01:20:27,283
Yeah.

1320
01:20:28,072 --> 01:20:29,073
Yeah, sure, come on.

1321
01:20:33,577 --> 01:20:35,124
You know, you could come with me.

1322
01:20:35,412 --> 01:20:36,834
To the meeting.

1323
01:20:36,955 --> 01:20:39,754
It's an open meeting,
meaning that anyone can come.

1324
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:41,752
Even you.

1325
01:20:43,253 --> 01:20:45,722
<i>So the cops got a ﬂashlight
on me behind the dumpster.</i>

1326
01:20:45,798 --> 01:20:47,345
<i>I'm wearing nothing
but my girlfriend's panties,</i>

1327
01:20:47,466 --> 01:20:50,094
<i>I got vomit all down
the front of my chest.</i>

1328
01:20:50,302 --> 01:20:53,681
<i>And I say to them,
"Uh, I might have had two beers."</i>

1329
01:21:01,105 --> 01:21:03,949
<i>So that's how
I got the nickname "Two Beer Barry."</i>

1330
01:21:06,443 --> 01:21:09,071
<i>I'm getting the stink eye
from Ed over here.</i>

1331
01:21:09,154 --> 01:21:11,122
<i>Have I gone off format?</i>

1332
01:21:12,116 --> 01:21:14,289
<i>My name is Barry and I am an alcoholic.</i>

1333
01:21:14,618 --> 01:21:15,665
Hi, Barry.

1334
01:21:15,953 --> 01:21:18,797
<i>Are there any other alcoholics present?</i>

1335
01:21:24,294 --> 01:21:25,637
<i>I always love a meeting where we</i>

1336
01:21:25,712 --> 01:21:27,180
<i>all have to identify at the top,</i>

1337
01:21:27,297 --> 01:21:31,018
<i>because it forces me
to be honest about who I really am.</i>

1338
01:21:32,469 --> 01:21:35,018
<i>And I never told the truth
out there, obviously.</i>

1339
01:21:35,139 --> 01:21:37,141
<i>I lied about everything.</i>

1340
01:21:38,684 --> 01:21:40,732
<i>I was taught in these rooms
that I would never get sober</i>

1341
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:43,697
<i>if I kept lying,
but that's what I was best at.</i>

1342
01:21:46,024 --> 01:21:48,118
<i>If I knew anything
in this world it was how to lie,</i>

1343
01:21:48,193 --> 01:21:50,161
<i>especially about my drinking.</i>

1344
01:21:50,487 --> 01:21:54,867
<i>But, whatever. I would lie
about the name of my dog,</i>

1345
01:21:54,992 --> 01:21:58,667
<i>I'd lie about the color of my own hair
right to your face.</i>

1346
01:22:00,038 --> 01:22:01,836
<i>And my whole life just became</i>

1347
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:05,211
<i>a series of lies strung together by me,</i>

1348
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:06,962
<i>- one after the other.
- I'm going to go, okay?</i>

1349
01:22:07,045 --> 01:22:08,467
- Sure.
- You got a ride home?

1350
01:22:08,547 --> 01:22:11,391
Uh, yeah. Sheila, she can give
me a ride. This is Sheila.

1351
01:22:11,842 --> 01:22:13,344
- How you doing?
- I'm Sheila.

1352
01:22:14,178 --> 01:22:16,351
<i>...that my lies would kill me.</i>

1353
01:22:17,014 --> 01:22:18,266
<i>Left to their own devices,</i>

1354
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:21,519
<i>my lies would walk me out that door.</i>

1355
01:22:27,858 --> 01:22:31,203
<i>Is it safe to say that Captain
Whitaker remains a bit of a mystery?</i>

1356
01:22:31,403 --> 01:22:33,405
<i>Those are your words, sir,
not mine.</i>

1357
01:22:33,697 --> 01:22:34,869
<i>I've been speaking
to some people</i>

1358
01:22:34,948 --> 01:22:37,042
<i>who are very close
to the NTSB investigation.</i>

1359
01:22:37,242 --> 01:22:39,745
<i>They are confident they will
soon be able to determine</i>

1360
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:42,089
<i>exactly what brought this plane down.</i>

1361
01:22:42,372 --> 01:22:43,749
<i>I'm sure they will, sir.</i>

1362
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,253
<i>Well, Ken and Vicky Evans,
thank you both very much.</i>

1363
01:22:47,544 --> 01:22:49,546
<i>Thank you, sir. And God bless you.</i>

1364
01:23:02,893 --> 01:23:04,566
How you feeling, Ken?

1365
01:23:07,064 --> 01:23:08,407
Happy to be alive.

1366
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:10,780
Blessed to be alive.

1367
01:23:13,237 --> 01:23:15,786
I'm Captain Whitaker. I was flying with...

1368
01:23:15,906 --> 01:23:17,249
I know who you are.

1369
01:23:18,784 --> 01:23:21,412
Excuse me. Could you give us
some privacy, please?

1370
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,337
Thank you.

1371
01:23:35,259 --> 01:23:36,602
So, uh...

1372
01:23:37,761 --> 01:23:39,434
How long have you been out of...

1373
01:23:39,763 --> 01:23:41,436
- Out of a coma?
- Yeah.

1374
01:23:42,432 --> 01:23:43,775
Two days.

1375
01:23:46,144 --> 01:23:47,316
Good.

1376
01:23:48,605 --> 01:23:52,280
Well, uh, look, I don't want
to disrupt your whole day.

1377
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:57,786
And God knows you've been
swamped by interviews and...

1378
01:23:59,783 --> 01:24:02,286
You were brilliant on CNN, by the way.

1379
01:24:03,287 --> 01:24:07,133
Both my legs are crushed.
My pelvis is snapped.

1380
01:24:07,624 --> 01:24:09,672
I'll probably never walk again,

1381
01:24:09,793 --> 01:24:12,296
at least not without a walker or braces.

1382
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:15,178
I'll certainly never fly again.

1383
01:24:16,633 --> 01:24:18,306
I'm very sorry, Ken.

1384
01:24:18,802 --> 01:24:22,306
That plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit.

1385
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,313
You reeked like gin or something.

1386
01:24:26,476 --> 01:24:29,480
I called Vicky
from the plane before we took off.

1387
01:24:30,647 --> 01:24:32,490
That's when the rain kicked up.

1388
01:24:34,484 --> 01:24:38,660
Well, I don't know
how much you remember,

1389
01:24:39,156 --> 01:24:40,658
but that plane,

1390
01:24:41,491 --> 01:24:43,164
it started falling apart, Ken.

1391
01:24:43,493 --> 01:24:45,962
I remember everything until we crashed.

1392
01:24:46,038 --> 01:24:47,665
I know what went on.

1393
01:24:50,167 --> 01:24:51,840
What are we trying to say, Ken?

1394
01:24:52,044 --> 01:24:53,671
What are we talking about?

1395
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:55,718
I don't know, Captain Whitaker.

1396
01:24:55,839 --> 01:24:57,011
What are we talking about?

1397
01:24:57,215 --> 01:25:00,185
I'm just trying to get a sense from you

1398
01:25:01,845 --> 01:25:05,520
about what you thought
caused the crash.

1399
01:25:06,516 --> 01:25:10,362
Was it the fact that you got on the plane
still drunk from the night before?

1400
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:17,035
The NTSB is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me.

1401
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:20,034
About the events on that flight.

1402
01:25:20,364 --> 01:25:24,369
Do you think you'd be alive
if I wasn't flying that plane?

1403
01:25:25,869 --> 01:25:26,870
No.

1404
01:25:27,371 --> 01:25:29,044
We'd all be dead.

1405
01:25:29,873 --> 01:25:33,252
But are you going to argue with me
that your physical state was tip-top?

1406
01:25:39,383 --> 01:25:40,555
Wait.

1407
01:25:41,385 --> 01:25:42,557
Sit.

1408
01:25:43,387 --> 01:25:44,559
Please.

1409
01:25:50,227 --> 01:25:53,447
I never shared my opinion
about your physical state

1410
01:25:53,563 --> 01:25:55,065
the morning of the flight.

1411
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,073
I never said a word.

1412
01:25:59,111 --> 01:26:00,112
Okay.

1413
01:26:00,237 --> 01:26:02,581
That crash was preordained.

1414
01:26:04,074 --> 01:26:08,079
I prayed on it, Captain.
Vicky and I both prayed on it.

1415
01:26:08,745 --> 01:26:10,338
There is only one judge, sir.

1416
01:26:10,414 --> 01:26:11,836
Praise Jesus.

1417
01:26:11,915 --> 01:26:14,259
And he's got a higher plan for you.

1418
01:26:15,085 --> 01:26:19,591
This event,
although it's tragic in its loss of life,

1419
01:26:21,425 --> 01:26:24,099
it's also a celebration of life.

1420
01:26:24,594 --> 01:26:27,894
Nothing happens in
the Kingdom of the Lord by mistake, sir.

1421
01:26:27,973 --> 01:26:29,145
Praise Jesus.

1422
01:26:29,266 --> 01:26:30,438
Captain.

1423
01:26:31,643 --> 01:26:33,520
Will you pray with us?

1424
01:26:45,449 --> 01:26:49,124
Jesus, our savior, we thank you
for blessing Captain Whitaker.

1425
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:52,297
For guiding his hand
on that fateful morning.

1426
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,842
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1427
01:26:55,959 --> 01:26:58,053
- Thanks for the ride.
- Okay.

1428
01:27:08,472 --> 01:27:09,644
Hi.

1429
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:12,067
Hey, hey.

1430
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:17,026
How you doing?

1431
01:27:22,152 --> 01:27:23,495
Oh, hey. Look.

1432
01:27:24,488 --> 01:27:25,831
Great, right?

1433
01:27:26,156 --> 01:27:27,203
It's kind of beautiful.

1434
01:27:27,324 --> 01:27:28,764
It is beautiful, isn't it? Like you.

1435
01:27:28,867 --> 01:27:29,834
Does it work?

1436
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:31,457
Yes, it works.

1437
01:27:31,536 --> 01:27:33,254
I learned how to fly on this baby.

1438
01:27:33,997 --> 01:27:37,342
Me and my friend Harling,
we flew it to Jamaica.

1439
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:38,884
Jamaica? In this?

1440
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,177
Yeah. In this.

1441
01:27:40,504 --> 01:27:44,634
We went on an overnight fishing trip
about two hours south of here.

1442
01:27:44,716 --> 01:27:47,390
Next thing you know... Bethel, Jamaica.

1443
01:27:48,512 --> 01:27:49,479
You're insane.

1444
01:27:49,554 --> 01:27:50,555
Yes, I am.

1445
01:27:50,722 --> 01:27:52,724
It was beautiful. It was like a postcard,

1446
01:27:52,849 --> 01:27:56,899
you know, like one of those
picture postcards.

1447
01:27:56,978 --> 01:28:00,699
White sand, beautiful, sky-blue seas.

1448
01:28:01,858 --> 01:28:04,031
It was the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

1449
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:07,202
Was the water warm?

1450
01:28:08,198 --> 01:28:09,541
Yes, it was very warm.

1451
01:28:09,741 --> 01:28:11,539
That's my kind of place.

1452
01:28:12,702 --> 01:28:14,079
Let's go.

1453
01:28:14,871 --> 01:28:17,249
Sure. Why not?

1454
01:28:17,374 --> 01:28:19,217
Yeah. Let's go tomorrow.

1455
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:21,295
- Oh, you're serious.
- I'm dead serious.

1456
01:28:21,419 --> 01:28:22,420
We'll go in the morning.

1457
01:28:22,546 --> 01:28:24,026
You know, we'll just get out of here.

1458
01:28:24,089 --> 01:28:25,591
- Start over.
- Whip, we can't. No.

1459
01:28:25,715 --> 01:28:28,685
Yes, we can. It'll be beautiful.

1460
01:28:29,135 --> 01:28:30,352
Bright sand beaches...

1461
01:28:30,428 --> 01:28:31,930
- I'm worried about you.
- It's...

1462
01:28:32,055 --> 01:28:33,898
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine. Thank you.

1463
01:28:34,224 --> 01:28:36,522
- You're not. You're really not.
- Yes, I am. Yes, lam.

1464
01:28:36,601 --> 01:28:38,399
You need help.

1465
01:28:39,229 --> 01:28:41,231
You need rehab, Whip.

1466
01:28:42,899 --> 01:28:45,743
You think I need rehab?
So, you go to two AA meetings

1467
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:48,163
and I need rehab? Okay.

1468
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:49,911
Hey, look, who are you, Jesus Christ?

1469
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:51,583
Don't worry about me, okay?

1470
01:28:51,908 --> 01:28:54,582
You just worry about yourself.
Don't worry about me.

1471
01:28:54,828 --> 01:28:55,909
We're the same, you and me.

1472
01:28:55,954 --> 01:28:56,955
- No, we're not the same.
- Yeah, we are.

1473
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,879
We are not the same.
I don't suck dick to get high, okay?

1474
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:01,380
And don't give me that
your mother died...

1475
01:29:01,459 --> 01:29:02,506
- I never!
- ...and your father...

1476
01:29:02,627 --> 01:29:03,674
I never in my life...

1477
01:29:03,753 --> 01:29:05,847
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1478
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:07,716
- That why you shot dope?
- That's not fair.

1479
01:29:07,799 --> 01:29:09,142
That's why you get high?

1480
01:29:09,259 --> 01:29:11,057
There's a whole lot of people
out there whose mothers die

1481
01:29:11,136 --> 01:29:12,183
and they don't fucking drink.

1482
01:29:12,262 --> 01:29:13,684
- You're sick, Whip.
- Yeah, well,

1483
01:29:13,805 --> 01:29:15,603
I embrace it. Shit!

1484
01:29:16,474 --> 01:29:17,600
I choose to drink!

1485
01:29:17,767 --> 01:29:18,859
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

1486
01:29:18,977 --> 01:29:21,230
You choose it? Well, I don't see
a whole lot of choice going on here!

1487
01:29:21,313 --> 01:29:24,032
I choose to drink! And I blame myself!

1488
01:29:24,107 --> 01:29:26,860
I'm happy to! And you know why?

1489
01:29:26,943 --> 01:29:29,162
Because I choose to drink!

1490
01:29:29,613 --> 01:29:33,288
I got an ex-wife and a son I never talk to!

1491
01:29:33,617 --> 01:29:36,962
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink!

1492
01:29:37,287 --> 01:29:38,880
No. I got to go.

1493
01:29:38,955 --> 01:29:40,127
Nicole.

1494
01:29:57,474 --> 01:29:59,147
Hey, listen.

1495
01:30:03,647 --> 01:30:04,990
All right, look.

1496
01:30:07,651 --> 01:30:11,155
I was loaded when the plane crashed.

1497
01:30:12,322 --> 01:30:14,450
With this investigation,
I don't know what's going to happen.

1498
01:30:14,532 --> 01:30:17,160
I could go to jail for the rest of my life.

1499
01:30:18,495 --> 01:30:20,338
I got to get out of here.

1500
01:30:22,332 --> 01:30:24,334
And I want you to come with me.

1501
01:30:26,169 --> 01:30:27,170
Whip.

1502
01:30:32,175 --> 01:30:35,019
I'm afraid that I'm gonna use again.
Do you understand?

1503
01:30:35,095 --> 01:30:36,221
Then come with me.

1504
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,854
Just come with me. I need help, I do.

1505
01:30:41,017 --> 01:30:42,985
- I'd like it if you got help.
- I'll get help.

1506
01:30:43,061 --> 01:30:45,702
We'll go straight to Jamaica,
we'll go right to the local hospital.

1507
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:47,073
I'll do it.

1508
01:30:47,691 --> 01:30:50,365
For you. Any... Anything you want.

1509
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:55,873
I don't want to use again.

1510
01:30:57,033 --> 01:31:00,207
I can't. I won't make it back, Whip.

1511
01:31:02,205 --> 01:31:03,878
I won't force you to stay.

1512
01:31:04,082 --> 01:31:07,632
If you don't like it,
if I don't sober up, then you leave.

1513
01:31:07,711 --> 01:31:09,713
I promise you, you can leave.

1514
01:31:13,717 --> 01:31:15,719
We can leave before noon.

1515
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:17,600
I'm a great pilot.

1516
01:31:18,054 --> 01:31:20,898
So many beautiful things to see.

1517
01:31:22,392 --> 01:31:24,770
I just want you to come with me.

1518
01:32:25,455 --> 01:32:26,455
Everything okay, sweetie?

1519
01:32:26,498 --> 01:32:27,966
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1520
01:32:36,466 --> 01:32:37,809
Nicole.

1521
01:32:39,427 --> 01:32:40,644
Nicole?

1522
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:12,677
<i>You've reached
the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company.</i>

1523
01:33:12,752 --> 01:33:15,221
<i>Please leave a message
and it will be returned.</i>

1524
01:33:16,381 --> 01:33:18,141
<i>Hey, Whip,
if you're there, pick up.</i>

1525
01:33:18,174 --> 01:33:19,721
<i>It's Charlie. I got some good news.</i>

1526
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:42,202
Hello?

1527
01:33:53,209 --> 01:33:56,383
Oh! There's our man. Hey!

1528
01:33:58,214 --> 01:33:59,716
Captain Whitaker.

1529
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,894
Let me be the first to say,
"Congratulations."

1530
01:34:02,969 --> 01:34:04,892
It's a good day. We've won.

1531
01:34:05,221 --> 01:34:07,940
Yeah, this is what we call,
in my profession, a "walk over."

1532
01:34:08,224 --> 01:34:10,022
Yeah, they scheduled a hearing,
it's 10 days away.

1533
01:34:10,101 --> 01:34:11,648
They can be tough,
but you just gotta be sharp.

1534
01:34:11,769 --> 01:34:12,816
Stay focused.

1535
01:34:12,937 --> 01:34:14,314
Answer the questions correctly.

1536
01:34:14,397 --> 01:34:15,774
That's right, but we're good.

1537
01:34:16,065 --> 01:34:17,945
All right,
I've successfully had an "Act of God"

1538
01:34:18,067 --> 01:34:20,411
added to the NTSB's
list of probable causes.

1539
01:34:20,612 --> 01:34:22,330
We've shifted suspicion away from you.

1540
01:34:22,447 --> 01:34:24,449
It's no longer a question
of your condition,

1541
01:34:24,574 --> 01:34:26,247
but the condition of the plane.

1542
01:34:26,451 --> 01:34:28,249
Fantastic. That's what I've been
trying to tell everybody.

1543
01:34:28,328 --> 01:34:30,501
This is a broken plane.

1544
01:34:30,622 --> 01:34:31,623
That's right.

1545
01:34:32,415 --> 01:34:35,294
What about
my toxicology report?

1546
01:34:35,418 --> 01:34:36,715
Oh, I killed that.

1547
01:34:38,129 --> 01:34:41,008
There is no physical proof
that you were intoxicated on that plane,

1548
01:34:41,132 --> 01:34:42,429
and no eyewitnesses.

1549
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:45,478
So why are we here? We're good.

1550
01:34:45,929 --> 01:34:48,603
Uh... Because there is a small problem.

1551
01:34:48,806 --> 01:34:52,151
Because of turbulence,
there was no drink service on the flight,

1552
01:34:52,435 --> 01:34:56,565
but they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash.

1553
01:34:56,648 --> 01:34:58,150
Yeah, um...

1554
01:34:58,608 --> 01:35:00,702
And there's no physical
evidence on the bottles.

1555
01:35:00,818 --> 01:35:03,241
No DNA, no fingerprints
to link them to anyone,

1556
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:05,369
but they were uncapped and empty.

1557
01:35:05,615 --> 01:35:07,375
And the only people
who would have had access

1558
01:35:07,492 --> 01:35:10,666
to those bottles would be the flight crew.

1559
01:35:10,787 --> 01:35:14,291
Now, Margaret,
Evans and Camelia Satou,

1560
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:19,012
they all had clean tox reports,
so that only leaves you and, uh...

1561
01:35:19,128 --> 01:35:21,677
- Trina Marquez.
- Right, Trina Marquez.

1562
01:35:23,967 --> 01:35:25,139
Okay.

1563
01:35:26,636 --> 01:35:29,310
Okay, I see where we're going here.

1564
01:35:29,973 --> 01:35:32,977
That's funny, though, you know,
they only found two bottles.

1565
01:35:33,309 --> 01:35:35,482
- Why is that?
- I drank three.

1566
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,028
- One's missing.

1567
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:42,994
You know, when I first met you,

1568
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:46,323
I couldn't believe what a drunk,
arrogant scumbag you were.

1569
01:35:46,406 --> 01:35:47,407
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1570
01:35:47,532 --> 01:35:48,499
Oh, thank you, Hugh.

1571
01:35:48,574 --> 01:35:50,175
But I did the research,
Captain Whitaker.

1572
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:52,078
I heard the expert analysis,

1573
01:35:52,203 --> 01:35:54,706
and I got to tell you,
I'm in awe of what you did.

1574
01:35:55,331 --> 01:35:58,005
The FAA and the NTSB took 10 pilots,

1575
01:35:58,209 --> 01:35:59,552
placed them in simulators,

1576
01:35:59,669 --> 01:36:03,048
re-created the events that led
to this plane falling out of the sky.

1577
01:36:03,339 --> 01:36:06,559
Do you know how many of them
were able to safely land the planes?

1578
01:36:06,676 --> 01:36:07,677
Not one.

1579
01:36:08,011 --> 01:36:11,641
Every pilot crashed the aircraft,
killed everybody on board.

1580
01:36:11,723 --> 01:36:13,566
You were the only one who could do it.

1581
01:36:13,725 --> 01:36:14,726
Great.

1582
01:36:16,019 --> 01:36:17,066
I'm going home.

1583
01:36:17,186 --> 01:36:18,563
- Hey, wait, Whip. You can't...
- Captain Whitaker,

1584
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,860
I'm telling you right now,
you walk away...

1585
01:36:19,939 --> 01:36:21,282
- Listen, man.
- ...you're going to prison.

1586
01:36:21,357 --> 01:36:22,574
I'm trying to save your fucking life.

1587
01:36:22,692 --> 01:36:24,365
What fucking life?

1588
01:36:24,694 --> 01:36:27,038
Huh? Don't kill yourself
on my account, Hugh.

1589
01:36:27,363 --> 01:36:29,240
Captain Whitaker, this NTSB hearing

1590
01:36:29,365 --> 01:36:31,584
is a federal agency hearing.
Do you understand that?

1591
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:33,078
Yes, I understand that.

1592
01:36:33,202 --> 01:36:35,705
Okay. Well, we can't play
around with these people.

1593
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:40,135
Now, we walk in there
like this, with this, we're done.

1594
01:36:40,209 --> 01:36:42,883
Everything we've done
goes right out the window.

1595
01:36:43,546 --> 01:36:45,298
I have no more moves, all right?

1596
01:36:45,423 --> 01:36:47,391
It's all on you right now.

1597
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,439
Okay. Charlie,
just get him to the church on time.

1598
01:36:53,556 --> 01:36:56,025
Yeah, get him to the church on time!

1599
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,603
Yeah, Charlie,
just keep him nice and sober,

1600
01:36:58,728 --> 01:37:01,481
so he can save
your fucking union! Huh?

1601
01:37:01,606 --> 01:37:02,607
Listen, Whip...

1602
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:04,988
And that fat fuck's airline!
Fuck you, Charlie! Fuck you!

1603
01:38:07,797 --> 01:38:10,971
It's him. Yeah, it's him, all right.

1604
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:19,062
How you doing?

1605
01:38:20,226 --> 01:38:21,819
What are you doing here?

1606
01:38:22,019 --> 01:38:25,614
It's good to see you,
too, Deana. May I come in?

1607
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:31,495
I just thought I'd come by
and see how you and Will are doing.

1608
01:38:31,571 --> 01:38:33,573
Will! Knuckles!

1609
01:38:34,407 --> 01:38:38,162
We hadn't talked in a while,
and this whole thing happened.

1610
01:38:38,244 --> 01:38:41,339
I just thought I'd come by
and we could talk.

1611
01:38:41,664 --> 01:38:43,837
You know that I prefer that you call us.

1612
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:45,335
- Right, right.
- Yeah.

1613
01:38:45,418 --> 01:38:47,261
Yeah, call you. But I mean,

1614
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,514
it's not like anybody
around here calls me,

1615
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:53,764
in the last three years,
other than to ask for some money.

1616
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,433
Have you been drinking?

1617
01:38:56,762 --> 01:38:58,605
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

1618
01:38:58,848 --> 01:39:02,102
Seventeen seconds. Yeah.
Exactly 17 seconds.

1619
01:39:02,185 --> 01:39:04,279
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- I'm gonna ask you just to leave.

1620
01:39:04,353 --> 01:39:06,151
It took exactly 17 seconds
for my ex-wife,

1621
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:08,028
Deana Coleman,
to ask me if I was drinking.

1622
01:39:08,107 --> 01:39:09,984
- Just leave, Will.
- What, is that a world record?

1623
01:39:10,067 --> 01:39:12,286
Leave the house that I paid for?
That's what you want me to do?

1624
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:13,487
I'm calling the police.

1625
01:39:13,571 --> 01:39:14,618
Call the police.

1626
01:39:14,864 --> 01:39:15,956
I'm telling you to leave.

1627
01:39:16,032 --> 01:39:18,034
Will Whitaker, Junior!
How you doing, son?

1628
01:39:18,117 --> 01:39:20,961
Man of the house.
Thanks for calling me back.

1629
01:39:21,037 --> 01:39:23,711
I'm telling you to leave.

1630
01:39:24,457 --> 01:39:27,461
Are you?
You're the man of the house now?

1631
01:39:27,543 --> 01:39:29,716
You upset my mother. You gotta go.

1632
01:39:29,795 --> 01:39:31,797
Well, I'm your father, tough guy.

1633
01:39:31,881 --> 01:39:33,303
You're a drunk.

1634
01:39:33,674 --> 01:39:34,675
Get off!

1635
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,973
I'm a drunk. You don't know
who the fuck I am.

1636
01:39:37,053 --> 01:39:39,306
I sure don't! Why don't you tell me?

1637
01:39:39,388 --> 01:39:40,355
What?

1638
01:39:40,431 --> 01:39:42,308
Who the fuck are you, huh?
Who are you?

1639
01:39:42,391 --> 01:39:43,563
Get the fuck out!

1640
01:39:45,811 --> 01:39:46,983
Get the fuck out, man!

1641
01:39:47,063 --> 01:39:49,236
Whip, stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1642
01:39:49,315 --> 01:39:50,407
I love you, son.

1643
01:39:50,483 --> 01:39:51,655
Get the fuck out!

1644
01:39:51,859 --> 01:39:53,202
Stop it! That's enough!

1645
01:39:53,277 --> 01:39:54,324
Get out!

1646
01:39:55,655 --> 01:39:56,998
I know where I'm not wanted.

1647
01:39:58,199 --> 01:40:00,418
Captain Whitaker,
a lot of people are working

1648
01:40:00,493 --> 01:40:02,336
to keep you out of the media.
Are you hiding something?

1649
01:40:02,411 --> 01:40:04,413
Just give my family some room, please.

1650
01:40:04,664 --> 01:40:06,758
This is not the appropriate time.

1651
01:40:06,832 --> 01:40:08,334
At the appropriate time,

1652
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:12,342
I will tell my story, and, uh, now is

1653
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,174
<i>a time for grieving</i>

1654
01:40:14,507 --> 01:40:19,013
<i>and taking care of the injured.
Thank you.</i>

1655
01:40:19,345 --> 01:40:21,018
<i>Questions remain
about the flight,</i>

1656
01:40:21,097 --> 01:40:22,690
<i>but they won't be answered today</i>

1657
01:40:22,932 --> 01:40:24,434
<i>as Captain Whitaker politely asked</i>

1658
01:40:24,517 --> 01:40:26,519
<i>that we give his family some peace.</i>

1659
01:40:26,769 --> 01:40:30,444
<i>A reasonable request
from a quiet, heroic man who has...</i>

1660
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:33,113
- Hey, Charlie.

1661
01:40:35,361 --> 01:40:37,204
Listen, I just couldn't find a safe place.

1662
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,375
Amanda was kind enough
to let me in. Thank you.

1663
01:40:40,449 --> 01:40:42,201
Are you sure I can't get you something?

1664
01:40:42,285 --> 01:40:43,787
- No, I'm fine.
- No, we're good.

1665
01:40:43,869 --> 01:40:46,213
But thank you. Thank you very much.

1666
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,042
What the hell is wrong with you?

1667
01:40:50,543 --> 01:40:51,635
Really.

1668
01:40:52,545 --> 01:40:53,637
Hugh just called me.

1669
01:40:53,713 --> 01:40:56,717
Apparently, you went to
your ex-wife's house drunk as a skunk,

1670
01:40:56,799 --> 01:40:59,723
the news crews showed up
and then the police escort you out.

1671
01:40:59,802 --> 01:41:01,645
It's okay, though.
I been watching. It's okay.

1672
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:02,722
Oh, yeah, no,

1673
01:41:02,805 --> 01:41:04,148
Hugh checked
all the media outlets that covered it.

1674
01:41:04,223 --> 01:41:06,317
You come off fine.
So I guess we're good.

1675
01:41:06,392 --> 01:41:08,144
Okay, good. Okay,
here's the deal, though...

1676
01:41:08,394 --> 01:41:10,897
No, Whip, Whip. There's no deals.
All right, look at you.

1677
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:13,483
I got no idea what you're
gonna do or say, ever.

1678
01:41:13,566 --> 01:41:14,613
You're all over the place.

1679
01:41:14,692 --> 01:41:16,035
I was the one guy in your court.

1680
01:41:16,235 --> 01:41:17,327
The one guy!

1681
01:41:17,403 --> 01:41:20,077
I was your defender
and your apologist, but no more.

1682
01:41:20,156 --> 01:41:21,658
Charlie, I can do this.

1683
01:41:21,741 --> 01:41:24,164
You're about to
be questioned by a federal agency

1684
01:41:24,285 --> 01:41:26,413
about piloting an airliner drunk.

1685
01:41:26,495 --> 01:41:27,621
An airliner that crashed!

1686
01:41:27,705 --> 01:41:29,707
And you continue to drink!
And stumble around!

1687
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:31,212
What kind of crazy
do you have to be to do that?

1688
01:41:31,292 --> 01:41:32,339
I'm afraid of you.

1689
01:41:32,418 --> 01:41:33,670
Okay, all right.
Then let me stay with you.

1690
01:41:33,753 --> 01:41:34,845
Let me stay with you.

1691
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,092
They're staking out
all my houses anyway.

1692
01:41:36,172 --> 01:41:39,927
I'll stay
with you until, until...

1693
01:41:40,259 --> 01:41:43,433
Until the hearing.
I won't leave the house.

1694
01:41:46,265 --> 01:41:47,437
I won't.

1695
01:41:49,685 --> 01:41:50,982
You cannot drink in my house.

1696
01:41:51,062 --> 01:41:52,109
I won't. I won't. I won't.

1697
01:41:52,188 --> 01:41:53,861
You can't have a drink.

1698
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:56,283
I won't.

1699
01:42:02,782 --> 01:42:04,955
- Officer Edmonds.
- Yes, sir.

1700
01:42:05,284 --> 01:42:07,707
Whip, this is Officer Edmonds.
He'll be staying here tonight.

1701
01:42:07,787 --> 01:42:09,881
Any problems, he'll handle it.

1702
01:42:12,792 --> 01:42:15,045
- Captain Whitaker.
- Hugh.

1703
01:42:15,795 --> 01:42:18,139
You look great. I mean that.

1704
01:42:18,464 --> 01:42:20,184
Thank you.
Thank you very much. I feel good.

1705
01:42:20,216 --> 01:42:22,810
Yeah. Charlie tells me
you haven't had a drink in eight days.

1706
01:42:22,885 --> 01:42:24,979
Nine days, two hours, 26 minutes.

1707
01:42:25,054 --> 01:42:26,397
- But who's counting?

1708
01:42:26,472 --> 01:42:28,315
Okay. Right here.

1709
01:42:30,309 --> 01:42:33,438
So, yeah, we wanted to make this
as easy as possible on you.

1710
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:34,738
I hope this is okay.

1711
01:42:34,814 --> 01:42:36,862
You can just relax, get some rest.

1712
01:42:36,941 --> 01:42:39,069
Order up a steak, get a movie.

1713
01:42:39,485 --> 01:42:44,742
I made a copy of the entire investigation
and my file on you.

1714
01:42:45,324 --> 01:42:47,326
I was trying to anticipate what kinds of

1715
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:49,333
questions they might ask you
under oath,

1716
01:42:49,578 --> 01:42:52,047
and I wrote some
non-damaging responses.

1717
01:42:52,123 --> 01:42:54,091
So, it's all in there.

1718
01:42:54,166 --> 01:42:58,512
You know, with photos, interviews,
there's some testimony in there.

1719
01:42:58,838 --> 01:43:00,465
I called Ellen Block, told her you're here.

1720
01:43:00,548 --> 01:43:01,845
You're all tucked in.

1721
01:43:02,675 --> 01:43:04,518
She got the knife out for me?

1722
01:43:06,011 --> 01:43:09,686
Well, look, she's
not happy that I killed the tox report,

1723
01:43:09,932 --> 01:43:11,229
but this isn't a trial,

1724
01:43:11,308 --> 01:43:13,185
so she's very limited
in the kinds of questions

1725
01:43:13,394 --> 01:43:14,395
she can ask you.

1726
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:15,863
You know? You're gonna be fine.

1727
01:43:15,938 --> 01:43:19,818
Yeah, the hearing's
at 10:00, so just downstairs,

1728
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:23,120
so we're figuring we meet here at 9:00
for breakfast in the room

1729
01:43:23,195 --> 01:43:26,039
- and take it from there.
- Take it from there.

1730
01:43:26,115 --> 01:43:27,116
Yeah.

1731
01:43:27,616 --> 01:43:29,459
All right, Captain Whitaker,
see you in the morning.

1732
01:43:29,535 --> 01:43:32,459
Thank you. And thank you
for letting me stay in your house.

1733
01:43:32,538 --> 01:43:34,258
You have a beautiful home,
beautiful family.

1734
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:35,257
You did great.

1735
01:43:35,332 --> 01:43:36,800
I needed it. I needed it.

1736
01:43:36,876 --> 01:43:39,129
- That's all right. Happy to do it.
- Okay. Yep.

1737
01:43:40,546 --> 01:43:42,765
- All right. See you in the morning.
- Okay, yes.

1738
01:43:51,557 --> 01:43:52,900
Just like flying.

1739
01:46:14,199 --> 01:46:15,371
Hello?

1740
01:46:36,722 --> 01:46:37,894
Hello.

1741
01:48:59,114 --> 01:49:00,161
How's our man?

1742
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,332
Not a peep.

1743
01:49:09,374 --> 01:49:10,671
Maybe he overslept.

1744
01:49:10,751 --> 01:49:12,003
Yeah.

1745
01:49:12,711 --> 01:49:15,055
You didn't let
any girls in there last night, did you?

1746
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:17,474
No, sir, not a soul.

1747
01:49:17,549 --> 01:49:20,473
No one came in or out
besides room service.

1748
01:49:22,096 --> 01:49:23,097
Okay.

1749
01:49:25,724 --> 01:49:27,067
You have a key?

1750
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:28,936
Hey, Whip.

1751
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:32,231
Hey, buddy! Whip!

1752
01:49:32,564 --> 01:49:34,237
Holy shit.

1753
01:49:35,609 --> 01:49:36,986
- What the hell?
- No kidding.

1754
01:49:37,277 --> 01:49:39,154
- What the hell?
- Where the fuck is he?

1755
01:49:39,238 --> 01:49:40,911
- Oh, Jesus.
- Where is he?

1756
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,742
- Where is he? Where is he?
- I don't know.

1757
01:49:42,908 --> 01:49:44,749
Did he fucking walk away?
Son of a bitch.

1758
01:49:44,910 --> 01:49:46,912
Hugh. Hugh. Whip!

1759
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,081
Damn it!

1760
01:49:49,331 --> 01:49:51,004
- Oh, no. Is he dead?
- I don't know.

1761
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:52,593
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

1762
01:49:52,835 --> 01:49:54,007
Yeah, I'm dead!

1763
01:49:54,086 --> 01:49:56,009
You want me to
get an ambulance?

1764
01:49:56,255 --> 01:49:58,178
- No, no, no. No. No.
- No.

1765
01:49:58,257 --> 01:49:59,509
Who's making all that noise?

1766
01:49:59,591 --> 01:50:01,935
Let's just get him to the bed. Come on.

1767
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:03,604
Come on. That's all right.

1768
01:50:03,929 --> 01:50:05,181
That's it, Charlie.

1769
01:50:05,264 --> 01:50:07,425
Okay? That's it.
We're fucked, man. He just fucked us.

1770
01:50:07,516 --> 01:50:09,143
Your guy just fucked us, Charlie.

1771
01:50:09,226 --> 01:50:11,445
All right. You just get on the front door
make sure nobody comes in.

1772
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,692
Put that on your head.

1773
01:50:12,771 --> 01:50:15,024
There you go, man. What time is it?

1774
01:50:15,107 --> 01:50:16,575
We've got 45 minutes, okay?

1775
01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:18,277
How much grace you think we've got?

1776
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:19,862
Grace? Ellen Block?

1777
01:50:19,945 --> 01:50:21,538
We're going to get some fucking grace?

1778
01:50:21,613 --> 01:50:22,865
Well,
we probably got an hour before

1779
01:50:22,948 --> 01:50:24,450
we really gotta get him downstairs.

1780
01:50:24,533 --> 01:50:25,830
Okay. Great.
Well, let's just get a wheelchair

1781
01:50:25,909 --> 01:50:27,035
and wheel his ass into the hearing!

1782
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:28,416
Call Harling Mays, man.

1783
01:50:28,495 --> 01:50:29,621
Oh, Harling's got a wheelchair?

1784
01:50:29,705 --> 01:50:31,127
He's got cocaine.

1785
01:50:32,124 --> 01:50:33,467
Cocaine?

1786
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:42,635
Hey, brother. Harling Mays.
I'm on the list.

1787
01:50:43,135 --> 01:50:44,307
Whip.

1788
01:50:46,138 --> 01:50:47,890
What's the deal, buddy?

1789
01:50:47,973 --> 01:50:49,975
You look like you're hurtin' for certain.

1790
01:50:50,058 --> 01:50:53,528
- Thanks for...
- Do not touch the merch, motherfucker!

1791
01:50:57,149 --> 01:50:58,992
Take one step back, please.

1792
01:51:01,153 --> 01:51:03,622
Cee Lo, I need you outside
guarding the door, please.

1793
01:51:03,697 --> 01:51:05,258
- Thank you very much.

1794
01:51:05,324 --> 01:51:06,667
Go ahead.

1795
01:51:07,159 --> 01:51:08,502
It's all right. Yeah.

1796
01:51:09,161 --> 01:51:11,630
All right, gentlemen,
I need that table cleared

1797
01:51:11,705 --> 01:51:14,003
and placed in front of Whip
with a chair behind it.

1798
01:51:14,666 --> 01:51:16,339
Now, please!

1799
01:51:18,503 --> 01:51:21,803
I need a glass of water,
I need a credit card,

1800
01:51:21,882 --> 01:51:23,509
I need a hundred dollar bill.

1801
01:51:23,842 --> 01:51:25,344
I got a 20.

1802
01:51:25,594 --> 01:51:26,846
She'll do.

1803
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:29,852
All right, Whip, banana boat's a-coming.

1804
01:51:30,182 --> 01:51:32,355
And I need a coco puff.

1805
01:51:32,684 --> 01:51:33,856
A what?

1806
01:51:34,686 --> 01:51:39,032
Just take the tiniest little bit of tobacco
out of the top of the cigarette, please.

1807
01:51:39,358 --> 01:51:41,031
Damn. Amateur night.

1808
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,863
Banana boat's a-coming.
You're almost home.

1809
01:51:43,946 --> 01:51:46,699
Okay, baby, we're gonna do

1810
01:51:48,533 --> 01:51:50,706
two small whiffs first,

1811
01:51:52,204 --> 01:51:54,673
- one on each side.

1812
01:51:54,748 --> 01:51:57,627
Just a little primer to get us started.

1813
01:51:57,709 --> 01:51:59,052
Okay.

1814
01:51:59,878 --> 01:52:01,221
Coco puff.

1815
01:52:03,507 --> 01:52:04,508
Ah!

1816
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:12,937
Ah!

1817
01:52:13,016 --> 01:52:15,144
Attaboy. Attaboy. Head back. Swallow.

1818
01:52:15,227 --> 01:52:16,820
Water! Water now, chief, you.

1819
01:52:29,491 --> 01:52:30,492
All right.

1820
01:52:30,909 --> 01:52:32,911
A little coco puff, buddy.

1821
01:52:34,246 --> 01:52:35,338
Who's the banana man?

1822
01:52:35,414 --> 01:52:36,506
You.

1823
01:52:36,748 --> 01:52:39,752
There's the banana man.
All right. Now focus up, big dog.

1824
01:52:46,258 --> 01:52:47,384
Here's the train coming to you.

1825
01:52:47,467 --> 01:52:48,468
Yeah.

1826
01:52:49,594 --> 01:52:51,596
Keep it down, big dog.

1827
01:52:52,931 --> 01:52:54,604
Banana boat's coming.

1828
01:52:54,933 --> 01:52:56,355
And the banana boat is here.

1829
01:52:56,435 --> 01:52:57,812
All right.

1830
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,613
Nothing keeps you down, dog.

1831
01:53:03,942 --> 01:53:06,616
Nothing keeps that big dog down.

1832
01:53:09,448 --> 01:53:10,870
You all are up.

1833
01:53:13,035 --> 01:53:14,082
Oh, uh...

1834
01:53:14,161 --> 01:53:15,208
I don't, um...

1835
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:18,416
Shit, I'll take another hit.

1836
01:53:22,961 --> 01:53:24,008
Ah!

1837
01:53:27,466 --> 01:53:30,060
Thank you, brother. Shit, I'm back.

1838
01:53:30,135 --> 01:53:32,058
All right, baby. I love you.

1839
01:53:32,137 --> 01:53:34,310
I love you, too. Shit.

1840
01:53:40,312 --> 01:53:44,237
All right. Which one of you gentlemen
is funding this enterprise?

1841
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:47,277
It's 500 bucks.

1842
01:53:47,361 --> 01:53:49,329
I've got like 80 bucks on me.

1843
01:53:50,822 --> 01:53:51,869
How much you got?

1844
01:53:51,948 --> 01:53:53,325
I got it. I got it.

1845
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,409
All right.

1846
01:53:54,659 --> 01:53:56,411
- Here, just... You pay him.
- What?

1847
01:53:56,495 --> 01:53:57,587
Pay him.

1848
01:53:57,996 --> 01:53:59,998
Thank you. Okay.

1849
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,675
There's a gram in here.

1850
01:54:03,001 --> 01:54:06,346
You take it. You paid for it.
He's going to need it later.

1851
01:54:07,923 --> 01:54:09,925
My work here is finished.

1852
01:54:12,844 --> 01:54:15,017
See y'all on the dark side of the moon.

1853
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:44,384
Your nose.

1854
01:55:06,064 --> 01:55:07,625
I'll go ahead and tell them we're here.

1855
01:55:07,899 --> 01:55:09,071
You're going to make it.

1856
01:55:09,151 --> 01:55:10,869
Remember, if they
ask you anything about your drinking,

1857
01:55:10,944 --> 01:55:12,992
it's totally acceptable
to say, "I don't recall."

1858
01:55:13,071 --> 01:55:16,416
Hey, don't tell me
how to lie about my drinking, okay?

1859
01:55:16,741 --> 01:55:18,181
I know how to lie about my drinking.

1860
01:55:18,201 --> 01:55:20,081
I've been lying about
my drinking my whole life.

1861
01:55:37,762 --> 01:55:39,639
Those are difficult images to watch.

1862
01:55:39,723 --> 01:55:42,852
For the record, I'm Ellen Block,
hearing officer for this hearing.

1863
01:55:42,934 --> 01:55:44,607
Captain Whitaker, good morning.

1864
01:55:44,769 --> 01:55:45,816
Morning.

1865
01:55:45,896 --> 01:55:46,863
<i>Morning.</i>

1866
01:55:46,938 --> 01:55:48,906
What that video captures is that

1867
01:55:48,982 --> 01:55:51,451
the aircraft
was in a relatively stable glide

1868
01:55:51,526 --> 01:55:53,779
just prior to the moment of impact.

1869
01:55:53,862 --> 01:55:56,081
However, according to
the data we retrieved

1870
01:55:56,156 --> 01:55:58,033
from the cockpit data recorders,

1871
01:55:58,283 --> 01:56:02,709
at exactly 9:34,
after flying 27 minutes without incident,

1872
01:56:02,787 --> 01:56:05,631
the transponder recorded
a loss in altitude

1873
01:56:05,707 --> 01:56:09,052
in excess of 4,800 feet per minute

1874
01:56:09,294 --> 01:56:12,798
in what is considered
a "full pitch nose down" attitude.

1875
01:56:13,131 --> 01:56:17,682
Then, at 9:42,
according to the data recorders,

1876
01:56:17,886 --> 01:56:20,981
a decision was made
to invert the aircraft.

1877
01:56:21,056 --> 01:56:23,809
The NTSB has created
an animated simulation

1878
01:56:23,892 --> 01:56:26,065
that I would like to play at this point.

1879
01:56:26,728 --> 01:56:27,900
<i>We're going to roll it.</i>

1880
01:56:28,146 --> 01:56:29,426
<i>What do you mean "Roll it"?</i>

1881
01:56:29,481 --> 01:56:31,042
<i>We gotta do something
to stop this dive.</i>

1882
01:56:31,066 --> 01:56:32,739
<i>Margaret, what's your son's name?</i>

1883
01:56:32,984 --> 01:56:34,827
<i>- Trevor.</i>
<i>- Say, "I love you, Trevor."</i>

1884
01:56:34,903 --> 01:56:35,904
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Black box.</i>

1885
01:56:35,987 --> 01:56:37,027
<i>Say, "I love you, Trevor."</i>

1886
01:56:37,072 --> 01:56:39,632
<i>I love you, Trevor.
You be a good boy. Mommy loves you.</i>

1887
01:56:39,699 --> 01:56:41,622
<i>Okay, here we go.
I've got control.</i>

1888
01:56:42,494 --> 01:56:45,338
<i>Oh, Lord Jesus!</i>

1889
01:56:45,664 --> 01:56:47,507
- <i>...ﬂaps.</i>
<i>- Flaps!</i>

1890
01:56:47,832 --> 01:56:49,834
<i>- Speed brakes.</i>
<i>- Speed brakes!</i>

1891
01:56:50,669 --> 01:56:52,512
<i>Margaret! Power!</i>

1892
01:56:52,837 --> 01:56:54,180
<i>- Gear up.</i>
<i>- Gear up!</i>

1893
01:56:54,506 --> 01:56:56,179
<i>Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!</i>

1894
01:56:56,258 --> 01:56:57,538
<i>We're flying. We're level.</i>

1895
01:56:57,551 --> 01:56:59,098
<i>We can maintain altitude like...</i>

1896
01:56:59,344 --> 01:57:02,518
<i>Atlanta Center... SouthJet... 7.
We are inverted.</i>

1897
01:57:02,597 --> 01:57:04,190
<i>I... We are inverted.</i>

1898
01:57:04,516 --> 01:57:06,393
<i>SouthJet 2... 7, uh,</i>

1899
01:57:06,476 --> 01:57:07,978
<i>did you say inverted?</i>

1900
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:11,944
That audio is tragic and compelling.

1901
01:57:12,023 --> 01:57:14,367
I chose to play that part
of the cockpit recording

1902
01:57:14,609 --> 01:57:17,783
to highlight a key moment
on board flight 227,

1903
01:57:18,029 --> 01:57:20,532
wherein you say, "We're going to roll it."

1904
01:57:20,865 --> 01:57:23,038
"Here we go. I've got control."

1905
01:57:23,285 --> 01:57:26,835
You made a very conscious decision
to invert the aircraft,

1906
01:57:26,913 --> 01:57:29,712
to roll the plane upside down,
is that correct?

1907
01:57:32,877 --> 01:57:35,721
I'm not sure if it was conscious. But...

1908
01:57:37,215 --> 01:57:39,217
it was more like instinct.

1909
01:57:40,385 --> 01:57:42,387
What led to that decision?

1910
01:57:46,558 --> 01:57:47,901
I don't recall.

1911
01:57:48,226 --> 01:57:50,354
Let me quote from
an investigative summary.

1912
01:57:50,437 --> 01:57:52,735
"From 9:34 until 9:42,

1913
01:57:52,814 --> 01:57:55,818
the events on the aircraft are,"
again I quote,

1914
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:58,073
"bold and remarkable."

1915
01:57:58,403 --> 01:58:01,907
"By inverting the plane,
Captain Whitaker arrested the descent

1916
01:58:02,157 --> 01:58:04,660
and allowed the aircraft to level off,

1917
01:58:04,909 --> 01:58:08,755
enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas

1918
01:58:08,997 --> 01:58:13,173
and allowing him to execute
a forced landing in an open field."

1919
01:58:22,594 --> 01:58:25,268
I heard a loud metallic bang.

1920
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:28,103
We pitched nose down.

1921
01:58:29,768 --> 01:58:31,111
- No control.
- Yes.

1922
01:58:31,436 --> 01:58:34,360
First Officer Evans'
testimony confirms the same.

1923
01:58:37,108 --> 01:58:38,951
I want to show you something.

1924
01:58:43,281 --> 01:58:45,283
Nothing's happening.

1925
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:47,167
This remote isn't working.

1926
01:58:47,243 --> 01:58:49,792
Apologies. I can do this manually.

1927
01:59:00,965 --> 01:59:03,639
This is the jackscrew
on the tail assembly

1928
01:59:03,718 --> 01:59:06,813
that articulates the horizontal stabilizer,

1929
01:59:06,971 --> 01:59:08,473
also known as the elevator.

1930
01:59:08,556 --> 01:59:09,773
As you can see,

1931
01:59:10,058 --> 01:59:13,187
the threads on this screw
are almost entirely gone.

1932
01:59:13,645 --> 01:59:16,899
This part was suggested as
a maintenance replacement

1933
01:59:17,232 --> 01:59:20,953
in January of 2011.
It was never replaced.

1934
01:59:21,486 --> 01:59:24,410
It had an additional
1,200 hours of flight on it.

1935
01:59:24,489 --> 01:59:25,661
It finally failed.

1936
01:59:25,782 --> 01:59:28,285
Our investigators have concluded

1937
01:59:28,743 --> 01:59:30,586
that the jackscrew snapped

1938
01:59:30,829 --> 01:59:34,504
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position,

1939
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:37,382
locking the elevator in a down position,

1940
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:39,838
which forced the plane into a dive.

1941
01:59:40,171 --> 01:59:43,926
The loss of the elevator was,
and I quote our report,

1942
01:59:44,008 --> 01:59:47,512
"A catastrophic event
from which recovery was improbable

1943
01:59:47,595 --> 01:59:49,814
and stable flight impossible."

1944
01:59:53,685 --> 01:59:55,028
Mr. Whitaker,

1945
01:59:55,854 --> 01:59:57,822
I want to talk about the days leading

1946
01:59:57,897 --> 02:00:00,525
and the hours leading
up to the accident.

1947
02:00:00,650 --> 02:00:01,742
But before I do,

1948
02:00:01,818 --> 02:00:03,570
I want to remind you
that you are under oath

1949
02:00:03,653 --> 02:00:05,451
and that any testimony
you give here today

1950
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:06,952
will be considered admissible

1951
02:00:07,073 --> 02:00:09,826
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings.

1952
02:00:10,034 --> 02:00:12,036
Do you understand what that means?

1953
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:17,584
Captain Whitaker, for the record,
I need you to verbalize your answer.

1954
02:00:18,835 --> 02:00:21,179
Uh, I'm sorry. Yes, I understand.

1955
02:00:21,629 --> 02:00:23,802
On the three days
leading up to the accident,

1956
02:00:23,882 --> 02:00:25,475
Tuesday, October 11th,

1957
02:00:25,550 --> 02:00:29,054
Wednesday, October 12th
or Thursday, October 13th,

1958
02:00:29,137 --> 02:00:33,233
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements?

1959
02:00:34,184 --> 02:00:35,527
No, I did not.

1960
02:00:35,977 --> 02:00:37,695
On the morning of the accident,

1961
02:00:37,937 --> 02:00:39,985
Friday, October 14th,

1962
02:00:40,064 --> 02:00:45,241
did you consume any alcohol
or ingest any chemicals or drugs

1963
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:48,995
that may have impaired
your ability to perform your job?

1964
02:00:49,407 --> 02:00:51,080
No, I did not.

1965
02:00:51,951 --> 02:00:55,581
Mr. Whitaker, do you now
or have you ever had

1966
02:00:55,663 --> 02:00:57,882
a problem with alcohol dependency,

1967
02:00:57,957 --> 02:01:00,426
alcoholism or drug addiction?

1968
02:01:00,752 --> 02:01:01,753
No.

1969
02:01:04,088 --> 02:01:06,261
Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done.

1970
02:01:13,348 --> 02:01:17,103
Due to the severe turbulence
in the early part of the flight,

1971
02:01:17,185 --> 02:01:19,529
you asked the flight crew to suspend

1972
02:01:19,604 --> 02:01:21,606
the beverage service
on the plane, is that correct?

1973
02:01:21,815 --> 02:01:22,816
Yes, that's correct.

1974
02:01:23,024 --> 02:01:25,527
I suspended
the drink service on the plane.

1975
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:28,079
Are you aware that
our investigators found

1976
02:01:28,154 --> 02:01:31,749
two single service vodka bottles
in the galley trash bin?

1977
02:01:34,118 --> 02:01:35,461
Yes, I'm aware of that.

1978
02:01:36,788 --> 02:01:39,132
There were five crew members on board

1979
02:01:39,207 --> 02:01:41,801
that would have had access
to the beverage trolley.

1980
02:01:42,126 --> 02:01:44,049
Less than an hour after the accident,

1981
02:01:44,128 --> 02:01:46,096
blood was taken from each
of these crew members,

1982
02:01:46,172 --> 02:01:49,096
yourself, First Officer Evans,

1983
02:01:49,843 --> 02:01:52,187
Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason,

1984
02:01:52,804 --> 02:01:55,648
and posthumously from Camelia Satou

1985
02:01:56,307 --> 02:01:58,480
and Katerina Marquez.

1986
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:02,655
Toxicology analysis was performed and

1987
02:02:03,147 --> 02:02:05,650
three of these tests came back negative,

1988
02:02:05,733 --> 02:02:08,657
one was disqualified
for technical reasons,

1989
02:02:08,736 --> 02:02:11,410
and one tested positive for alcohol.

1990
02:02:11,489 --> 02:02:14,493
It registered a .17 blood alcohol level.

1991
02:02:14,826 --> 02:02:16,499
Are you aware of that?

1992
02:02:17,161 --> 02:02:19,334
Yeah, I'm aware of it now.

1993
02:02:22,083 --> 02:02:23,300
Mmm-hmm.

1994
02:02:26,087 --> 02:02:28,761
Miss Marquez was not only a colleague,

1995
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:31,719
but you knew her outside of work,
is that correct?

1996
02:02:33,094 --> 02:02:34,767
Outside of work?

1997
02:02:35,597 --> 02:02:36,598
No, not really.

1998
02:02:37,098 --> 02:02:39,692
Did you know Miss Marquez
had a drinking problem?

1999
02:02:40,852 --> 02:02:41,944
No, I did not.

2000
02:02:42,353 --> 02:02:44,105
Did you ever see her drink to excess?

2001
02:02:47,108 --> 02:02:48,451
No, I did not.

2002
02:02:48,693 --> 02:02:51,697
Were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction?

2003
02:02:51,779 --> 02:02:56,034
The last time was 16 months ago
and paid for by SouthJet Airlines.

2004
02:02:57,118 --> 02:02:58,290
No, I did not.

2005
02:03:08,755 --> 02:03:10,428
Is it your opinion

2006
02:03:10,882 --> 02:03:12,850
that Katerina Marquez

2007
02:03:13,801 --> 02:03:15,644
drank on that flight?

2008
02:03:27,273 --> 02:03:29,116
Could you repeat the question?

2009
02:03:29,442 --> 02:03:34,619
Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez
drank on that flight?

2010
02:03:46,292 --> 02:03:47,464
I'm sorry, my what?

2011
02:03:47,543 --> 02:03:49,216
Your opinion, Captain.

2012
02:03:49,337 --> 02:03:52,307
Since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report

2013
02:03:52,382 --> 02:03:54,476
that is admissible in this hearing,

2014
02:03:54,550 --> 02:03:57,224
and she in fact tested
positive for alcohol,

2015
02:03:57,303 --> 02:03:59,897
is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez

2016
02:04:00,139 --> 02:04:03,985
drank those two bottles
of vodka on the plane?

2017
02:04:13,653 --> 02:04:15,326
God help me.

2018
02:04:15,989 --> 02:04:17,081
I'm sorry, Mr. Whitaker,

2019
02:04:17,156 --> 02:04:19,329
I couldn't hear you. What did you say?

2020
02:04:21,828 --> 02:04:23,501
I said, "God help me."

2021
02:04:24,664 --> 02:04:27,588
Yes, well, however, is it your opinion...

2022
02:04:27,667 --> 02:04:28,839
It's my opinion

2023
02:04:29,419 --> 02:04:32,923
Trina did not drink that vodka.

2024
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:34,841
Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker?

2025
02:04:34,924 --> 02:04:36,564
She saved the boy's life, that's...

2026
02:04:36,592 --> 02:04:37,844
Could you speak louder,
Captain Whitaker?

2027
02:04:37,927 --> 02:04:40,680
Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka

2028
02:04:42,348 --> 02:04:44,350
because I drank the vodka.

2029
02:04:46,019 --> 02:04:47,942
What the hell? Objection!

2030
02:04:49,605 --> 02:04:51,206
Please
be seated, sir. Sir.

2031
02:04:51,274 --> 02:04:52,776
Captain Whitaker misspoke.

2032
02:04:53,443 --> 02:04:54,723
I drank the vodka bottles.

2033
02:04:54,736 --> 02:04:55,862
Didn't you hear me?
I said I object!

2034
02:04:56,112 --> 02:04:58,786
Please be seated, sir.
This is not a courtroom.

2035
02:04:58,906 --> 02:04:59,907
Well, I object anyway!

2036
02:05:01,701 --> 02:05:04,045
I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

2037
02:05:05,788 --> 02:05:07,210
Captain Whitaker,

2038
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:10,294
on the three nights
before the accident, October 11th...

2039
02:05:10,376 --> 02:05:12,470
October 11th, October 12th,

2040
02:05:12,545 --> 02:05:15,469
and 13th and 14th, I was intoxicated.

2041
02:05:15,548 --> 02:05:18,392
I drank all of those days. I drank.

2042
02:05:19,218 --> 02:05:20,561
In excess.

2043
02:05:21,971 --> 02:05:23,473
On the morning of the accident...

2044
02:05:23,639 --> 02:05:24,982
I was drunk.

2045
02:05:32,899 --> 02:05:34,401
I'm drunk now.

2046
02:05:40,823 --> 02:05:44,327
I'm drunk right now, Miss Block.

2047
02:05:51,751 --> 02:05:53,753
Because I'm an alcoholic.

2048
02:06:19,278 --> 02:06:20,621
That was it.

2049
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:25,793
I was finished.

2050
02:06:27,787 --> 02:06:29,130
I was done.

2051
02:06:32,291 --> 02:06:36,467
It was as if I had reached
my lifelong limit

2052
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:38,473
of lies.

2053
02:06:39,298 --> 02:06:41,972
I could not tell one more lie.

2054
02:06:45,638 --> 02:06:47,481
And maybe I'm a sucker,

2055
02:06:49,642 --> 02:06:52,145
'cause if I had told just one more lie,

2056
02:06:52,478 --> 02:06:55,322
I could have walked away
from all that mess

2057
02:06:55,648 --> 02:06:59,323
and kept my wings,
kept my false sense of pride.

2058
02:07:01,988 --> 02:07:03,581
And more importantly,

2059
02:07:03,698 --> 02:07:05,245
I could have avoided being locked up

2060
02:07:05,324 --> 02:07:06,746
in here with all you

2061
02:07:07,493 --> 02:07:10,337
nice folks for the last 13 months.

2062
02:07:14,041 --> 02:07:15,384
But I'm here.

2063
02:07:16,669 --> 02:07:20,765
And I'll be here
for at least the next four or five years.

2064
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:22,183
And that's fair.

2065
02:07:25,845 --> 02:07:28,519
I betrayed the public trust. I did.

2066
02:07:28,598 --> 02:07:30,271
That's how the judge explained it to me.

2067
02:07:30,349 --> 02:07:32,852
I had betrayed the public trust.

2068
02:07:34,854 --> 02:07:37,778
The FAA, they took away
my pilot's license.

2069
02:07:39,734 --> 02:07:41,281
And that's fair.

2070
02:07:42,111 --> 02:07:45,786
My chances
of ever flying again are slim to none.

2071
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:49,373
And I accept that.

2072
02:07:52,413 --> 02:07:55,257
I've had a lot of time
to think about it, all of it.

2073
02:07:57,084 --> 02:07:59,428
I've been doing some writing.

2074
02:08:01,255 --> 02:08:05,601
I wrote letters to each of the families
that had lost loved ones.

2075
02:08:08,429 --> 02:08:10,932
Some of them were able
to hear my apology.

2076
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,273
Some of them never will.

2077
02:08:15,937 --> 02:08:18,440
I also apologized to

2078
02:08:19,774 --> 02:08:24,450
all the people
that tried to help me along the way, but I

2079
02:08:25,738 --> 02:08:27,911
couldn't or wouldn't listen.

2080
02:08:31,786 --> 02:08:34,130
People like my wife, you know.

2081
02:08:37,458 --> 02:08:39,460
My ex-wife and, uh,

2082
02:08:43,464 --> 02:08:44,807
my son.

2083
02:08:48,302 --> 02:08:51,476
And again, like I said,
you know, some of them will

2084
02:08:53,808 --> 02:08:56,152
never forgive me. Some of them will.

2085
02:08:58,854 --> 02:09:00,697
But at least I'm sober.

2086
02:09:03,317 --> 02:09:06,491
I thank God for that.
I'm grateful for that.

2087
02:09:09,532 --> 02:09:11,250
And this is going to sound real stupid

2088
02:09:11,367 --> 02:09:14,211
coming from a man
who's locked up in prison,

2089
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:18,674
but for the first time in my life,

2090
02:09:19,834 --> 02:09:21,211
I'm free.

2091
02:09:35,016 --> 02:09:37,519
Whitaker. You got a visitor.

2092
02:10:15,222 --> 02:10:17,270
- You got 40 minutes.
- Okay.

2093
02:10:23,814 --> 02:10:24,815
Aw.

2094
02:10:26,442 --> 02:10:27,443
Ah.

2095
02:10:28,235 --> 02:10:29,908
Look at you, boy.

2096
02:10:30,446 --> 02:10:32,494
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

2097
02:10:32,573 --> 02:10:33,790
You look good.

2098
02:10:35,076 --> 02:10:36,749
Come on, sit down.

2099
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:39,463
This is a surprise.

2100
02:10:39,914 --> 02:10:41,131
You get that gift I sent you?

2101
02:10:41,207 --> 02:10:42,424
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

2102
02:10:42,625 --> 02:10:43,877
- Yeah? You like it?
- Yeah.

2103
02:10:43,959 --> 02:10:44,960
Good.

2104
02:10:46,754 --> 02:10:48,256
How's your mom?

2105
02:10:48,589 --> 02:10:49,932
Oh. She's all right.

2106
02:10:51,759 --> 02:10:56,105
My college counselor
wanted me to come and interview you.

2107
02:10:56,639 --> 02:10:57,640
Me?

2108
02:10:57,932 --> 02:11:00,936
Yeah. I'm writing essays
for college applications.

2109
02:11:01,102 --> 02:11:02,354
Good.

2110
02:11:02,603 --> 02:11:03,946
I need your help.

2111
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:05,823
You got it.

2112
02:11:07,108 --> 02:11:11,454
Well, this essay, the essay
that I have to write...

2113
02:11:13,948 --> 02:11:17,623
It's called "The Most Fascinating Person

2114
02:11:18,494 --> 02:11:20,167
That I've Never Met."

2115
02:11:27,169 --> 02:11:28,341
Okay.

2116
02:11:31,006 --> 02:11:32,349
So...

2117
02:11:37,304 --> 02:11:38,806
Who are you?

2118
02:11:47,690 --> 02:11:49,567
That's a good question.
