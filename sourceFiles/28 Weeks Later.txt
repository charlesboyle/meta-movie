1
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:55,894
- What are you gonna cook?
- Your favorite.

2
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:57,962
What, again?

3
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,153
- Well, this is the last one.
- What, you mean no more tomatoes?

4
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:19,683
You can never have
enough tins of tomatoes, eh?

5
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:22,230
Instead...

6
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:25,267
we've got five tins of chickpeas.

7
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,894
That should last at least five year, eh?

8
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,773
- Fancy a glass of wine?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

9
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,711
We're in luck.

10
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:47,452
Drinkable.

11
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:08,571
- You all right, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:14,643
Well, I'm not fine, it's all fucked, but...

13
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,652
- Our children are safe, aren't they?
- Totally. Yeah.

14
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:22,155
Thank God we paid for that school trip.
Imagine if we hadn't!

15
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:25,591
I can't. I can't imagine. I can't imagine.

16
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:30,894
And I don't want to imagine. I don't...
Listen, they're far, far away.

17
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:32,991
And they're safe and sound.

18
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:35,161
OK?

19
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,432
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:38,632
OK.

21
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:41,267
Don't worry...

22
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:45,341
gorgeous.

23
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,357
Not interrupting, am I?

24
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,663
No.

25
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:08,134
I found this in the cellar.

26
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:13,106
I'd forgotten all about it.
I thought we could have them after dinner.

27
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:14,870
Yeah.

28
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:35,460
- It smells wonderful.
- And is that a bottle of wine, Don?

29
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:38,591
- It is indeed, Geoff.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:41,932
There's chocolate for after,
courtesy of your good wife.

31
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:45,495
What have we here? I get blackberries.

32
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,808
Vanilla. Notes of autumn.

33
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:56,376
Karen?

34
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:04,384
He'll be hungry.

35
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:08,857
When he gets back
he'll want something to eat.

36
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:11,058
- Here we go again.
- Jacob, no.

37
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:15,296
Let me tell you something. It's five days
since your boyfriend ran out on us.

38
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:18,498
If he's still breathing,
he won't be interested in pasta.

39
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:20,371
Jacob!

40
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:23,411
- It'll be your fucking neck!
- Don't say that!

41
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,606
- Out of order, Jacob.
- Why?

42
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:29,150
We all know it's true.
The sooner she faces it, the better.

43
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:33,745
There are no survivors.
It's just us in here and them out there.

44
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:40,691
- Sam?
- Quiet!

45
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:44,722
- God, it's a boy.
- Wait, wait. You don't know who's out there.

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,668
- Please, let me in!
- Don, it's a kid!

47
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:51,763
Help! Let me in!

48
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,739
Bloody hell.

49
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:01,271
- Please! Please, let me in!
- We're coming.

50
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,374
Let me in!

51
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:07,250
Please! Help! Let me in!

52
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,552
Please!

53
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,924
Get in. Come on, get in. Come here.

54
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:30,074
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:38,919
- Where have you come from?
- Sandford.

56
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:41,683
Sandford's upriver a few miles.

57
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:47,925
- How did you get here?
- They were chasing me. Screaming.

58
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:50,430
I was scared. I ran.

59
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:54,128
I tried other houses.
They were empty.

60
00:05:54,203 --> 00:06:00,005
I came through the woods
and I followed the river until I got here.

61
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,441
- Who were chasing you?
- My mum.

62
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,843
My dad.

63
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:07,814
They're trying to kill me.

64
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:12,009
- There's others, too.
- How many?

65
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,357
- Loads.
- Sam?

66
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,563
- It's got me! It's got my arm!
- Karen, no!

67
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,657
Help me!

68
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:55,255
Alice! Get outta here!
Get down the escape hatch, go! Go!

69
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:59,665
- Geoff, I can't see. I can't see!
- Hold onto my hand!

70
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,337
Die, you fucker! Die!

71
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,406
Come back!

72
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:18,686
Oh, God!

73
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,620
Keep going. Follow Jacob.
Keep going. Sally, there's no time.

74
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:27,490
- We can't leave them!
- Sally, come on!

75
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,461
Go!

76
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,602
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

77
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,768
Where are you?

78
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:45,005
- Where are you?
- Alice! Alice, no! Alice!

79
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:50,649
Geoff, come on!

80
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:52,884
Come on!

81
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Geoff!

82
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,493
Sally, give me your hand.
Give me your hand, Sally!

83
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,663
No! Jacob! Help me!

84
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:15,537
Alice! Alice!

85
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:22,946
- Where are you?
- Come on! Leave him!

86
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:24,952
- I see him there!
- Leave him!

87
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,614
Let go! Quick!

88
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,159
Don! Help us!

89
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:39,866
Don!

90
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,234
Don!

91
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,432
Get in there!

92
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,659
Don!

93
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,120
Don!

94
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,691
Don!

95
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,735
Jacob!

96
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:53,264
Come on!

97
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:57,839
Jacob!

98
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,281
Dear God!

99
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,983
Jacob!

100
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:26,600
Jacob!

101
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,765
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

102
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:58,931
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

103
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,836
Welcome to London.

104
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:46,612
Hey, Doyle, you having fun down there?

105
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,149
You can kiss my ass.

106
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:52,652
This is the worst combat I ever saw.
Where's the combat?

107
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:53,880
I hear you.

108
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:56,287
- Give me something to shoot.
- Too easy.

109
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:59,554
North-east of med centre,
20th floor, three windows in.

110
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:03,587
- Fat guy jerking off in the toilet.
- Oh, bug-nuts. Him again.

111
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:06,223
I don't see him.
Where is Fester Fucknut?

112
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:08,929
His dick in his hand on the 20th floor.

113
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:12,599
Next to the fire exit.
I think he needs ajerk-off extender.

114
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:15,336
Doyle, you're the expert
in hand-to-hand combat.

115
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:17,411
- Man-to-man combat.
- Shut up.

116
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:21,347
- Think it might be your dad, Doyle.
- You got me.

117
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,279
Shit.

118
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:58,743
- Colonel Phillips here. What is your status?
- Good morning, Colonel.

119
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,847
- Morning.
- I'm watching the new arrivals disembark.

120
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:04,655
Yes, Major?

121
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,990
- It'll take all morning to process them.
- Copy.

122
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:11,521
No one told me that
we're now admitting children.

123
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,345
Just follow around to your right.

124
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:55,807
Green and brown. Interesting iris variation.

125
00:14:55,877 --> 00:15:01,076
It's usually hereditary.
Do one of your parents have the same?

126
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:03,343
My mother. She did.

127
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:12,224
- How old are you, Andy?
- 12.

128
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:17,463
I think that makes you
the youngest person in the country.

129
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,090
Well, your blood pressure is A-OK

130
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:23,568
and you're negative
on any serious diseases or afflictions.

131
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,833
I think you're OK to come in.

132
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:27,966
Welcome back to Britain.

133
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:34,268
We are headed for our area
of security and reconstruction

134
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:36,742
designated as District One.

135
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,974
District One is located on the Isle of Dogs.

136
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:46,578
Although the Isle of Dogs is completely safe,
the surrounding area of London is not.

137
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:51,853
Large numbers of bodies are still not cleared
from the original outbreak of infection.

138
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,919
Rats and wild dogs are prevalent,
as is disease.

139
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:59,330
New arrivals are reminded
for their own safety

140
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:04,736
it is absolutely forbidden to cross the river
and leave the security zone.

141
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,778
You will be joining 15,000 civilians
who are already resident in District One.

142
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:16,579
As we approach your new home, you'll notice
a dramatically increased military presence.

143
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:19,517
The US Army is responsible for your safety.

144
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:25,184
We will do everything we can do
to make your repatriation as easy as possible.

145
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,526
Inside District One, however,
we believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.

146
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,795
We have hot and cold running water,
24-hour electricity,

147
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:38,328
a medical centre,
a supermarket and even a pub.

148
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:45,244
We're nearly home.

149
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,404
- Dad! Dad!
- It's Dad! Come on.

150
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,166
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

151
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:47,973
I missed you so much.

152
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:51,871
Are you all right? Are you all right?

153
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,646
Guys. I never thought
I'd see you again, you know that?

154
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,224
Let's get something to eat.

155
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:21,605
I should have been notified
before children were brought in.

156
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:24,509
We've not established
the protocol for minors.

157
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:29,879
We have issues of disease and sanitation.
We don't fully understand the virus yet.

158
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:33,613
We understand that it did not manage
to go cross-species,

159
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:38,955
that it did not manage to go airborne and that
the last infected human died six months ago.

160
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,962
- We weren't here six months ago.
- Major.

161
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,828
- What are you afraid of?
- What if it comes back?

162
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,634
- It won't come back.
- What if it does?

163
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:55,437
If it comes back, we kill it.

164
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,036
Code Red.

165
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:09,414
Come on, guys.

166
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:13,185
What about this place, then, Andy?

167
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:16,155
Yeah, it's pretty good, Dad.

168
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,509
Look at the camera.

169
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:30,874
This way. Come through.

170
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:36,079
It's 25 floors. We've got the penthouse
up there. Believe me.

171
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,709
ID, sir. Thank you.

172
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:42,654
- So, what do you do here, Dad?
- What do I do? I'm a section officer.

173
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:47,457
I keep the lights on, the water running,
the heat running. See this? Look.

174
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:53,091
That says triple A - "access all areas."
That's me. I basically run the place, you know.

175
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:57,228
No. You're the caretaker really, aren't you?

176
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:02,375
No, I run the place.

177
00:21:10,952 --> 00:21:12,419
Like it?

178
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,546
- It's amazing!
- Even better than sunny Spain?

179
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:21,562
You ought to have seen the camps. There
were 20 in each tent and chemical toilets.

180
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:24,496
- Everything smelled of piss.
- Nice.

181
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:31,861
We'll be moving to a new house soon.
A couple of months, in fact.

182
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:34,271
A new house?

183
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:36,469
Yeah.

184
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:41,813
Listen, I hope you guys understand.

185
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,784
We're not gonna be able
to go back to our old house.

186
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:52,656
It's outside the security zone and I don't think
I'd want to go back there, even if I could.

187
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,456
What happened, Dad? To Mum?

188
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,325
Yeah.

189
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,963
Yeah.

190
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,309
Do you wanna sit down
and I'll tell you all about it?

191
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:26,519
Your mum and I were hiding in a house.

192
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:31,089
A wee cottage.

193
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:38,129
It was an old couple that owned it

194
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:42,038
and they were there, too.

195
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:45,503
Three other people.

196
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:49,712
And we were...

197
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,221
just trying to stay alive, I suppose.

198
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:59,521
We were doing OK for a while.
And then we were attacked.

199
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:06,956
They came in through the kitchen window.

200
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:10,500
They were really fast, you know.

201
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,899
Chased us.

202
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,804
Chased your mum.

203
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:25,848
And we were trapped.
Trapped in the bedroom.

204
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:27,578
Don!

205
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,783
And I see...

206
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:35,453
I see them...

207
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,691
biting her.

208
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:43,066
I couldn't do anything.

209
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:52,545
I tried to go back.

210
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,481
She was already gone.

211
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,588
She was already gone.

212
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:08,593
Was there nothing you could do?

213
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,058
No, there was nothing I could do.

214
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:19,903
I managed to get away.

215
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:25,376
Just running, running, running...

216
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:33,352
I got to this military camp.

217
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:42,625
And you know the rest. You know I've been
in quarantine waiting for you to come back.

218
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:50,429
We're just happy you're still alive.

219
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,518
I'm sorry.

220
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:04,336
Doyle...

221
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:07,939
- Doyle, you bastard.
- Boy, I've never seen you get so white.

222
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,914
- Fuck you.
- Good morning.

223
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:13,885
Yeah, fuck outta here, man.
I'm having all good dreams.

224
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:18,550
Sunday afternoon, clear blue skies,
I'm laying in bed with my wife...

225
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:21,561
And now I'm back in this shithole.

226
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,062
- I know.
- Yeah?

227
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,292
I had that same dream about your wife.

228
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:29,897
- Quit fucking with me.
- Get outta here.

229
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:36,239
- All right. Next time I'm gonna shoot you.
- All right. See you later, family man.

230
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:43,816
I told you, I'm gonna shoot you.

231
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:17,641
What's on the TV tonight?

232
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:45,437
Are you OK? Bad dream?

233
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:54,913
I get worried I'm gonna forget
what she looks like.

234
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:57,074
You won't forget.

235
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,686
I don't even have a picture of her.

236
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,815
You won't forget.

237
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,421
Promise?

238
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,589
Yeah.

239
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,469
Andy, we agreed.
You heard what they said.

240
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:27,741
It's only dogs and rats out there.
We'll get what we want and come back again.

241
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:31,215
- We should've told Dad.
- It's fine. Trust me.

242
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:34,083
They won't even know we're gone.

243
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,688
Where are you going?

244
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:14,955
Base, come in. We have two strays
who slipped out the north gate.

245
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:18,759
- Stray dogs?
- No, puppies.

246
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:21,232
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

247
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:22,826
Yes! Yeah!

248
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:25,303
London's mine!

249
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:39,277
That's what we need.

250
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,418
Yeah, if it had keys.

251
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:46,418
Wait here.

252
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:06,205
Let's go.

253
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,684
There you go.

254
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,099
Tam!

255
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:54,131
Tam!

256
00:34:57,544 --> 00:34:59,603
Tam?

257
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:07,250
Tammy, are you there?

258
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,617
Tam?

259
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:15,490
Tammy!

260
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:17,788
Tammy!

261
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:58,501
Tammy, this is stupid.
You're not being funny.

262
00:36:23,864 --> 00:36:26,298
I knew it.

263
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:49,281
You're hurting me!

264
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,234
No! No! No! No!

265
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:05,532
No, don't go! No!

266
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:07,766
No!

267
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:09,299
No!

268
00:37:20,053 --> 00:37:22,783
Doyle.

269
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:25,585
I got your puppies.

270
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,801
No!

271
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,608
Get off me! Get off me!

272
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,265
I apologize for these precautions.

273
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:15,637
It's standard protocol with any survivors,
though we haven't had to do it for a while.

274
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:20,611
The last survivor we came across
was over two months ago.

275
00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:28,247
Can you tell me anything
about how you managed to keep alive

276
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,312
while you were gone so long?

277
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:37,453
Do you know of any other survivors?

278
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:42,935
OK.

279
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:46,769
I'm just going to take a blood sample.

280
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,933
It won't hurt.

281
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:02,679
Have you come into direct contact
with the infected?

282
00:39:12,966 --> 00:39:15,662
OK.

283
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:26,642
I want to see my children.

284
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,982
Of course. Of course.

285
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,871
- Mr. Harris.
- Yeah.

286
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:59,071
- We've found your kids.
- Oh, thank God. Thank you so much.

287
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,443
We found your wife, too.

288
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:15,521
Can they hear me?

289
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:19,554
- So, what do you two think you're playing at?
- You said you saw her die.

290
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:22,227
- What?
- You said you saw her die!

291
00:40:25,872 --> 00:40:28,067
- I didn't say that.
- You did. You did.

292
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:30,735
Baby, I didn't use those words.

293
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,371
This is... I don't know.
I mean, it's confusing, you know.

294
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:38,281
It's... it's very hard
for you to imagine, you know?

295
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:42,287
- I... It's too hard to explain.
- Well, try to explain it, Dad! Try!

296
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:47,088
Try? What do you want me to say?
I thought I saw Mum... die.

297
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,721
Or I wouldn't have told you that.
I was sure.

298
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:57,426
Look, guys, I'm not sure
what's happening here...

299
00:40:57,504 --> 00:40:59,938
but it's good. OK?

300
00:41:00,006 --> 00:41:02,804
That's the point. Mum's alive.

301
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:05,173
I want to see her!

302
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:44,815
There's no question, sir.

303
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:47,148
She has the virus. She's infected.

304
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:52,016
Why isn't she showing any symptoms?

305
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:54,557
- I don't know.
- Speculate.

306
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:03,360
A genetic abnormality which acts
as some sort of natural immunity?

307
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:09,534
But the virus is still in her blood and saliva,
so technically she's not immune.

308
00:42:09,643 --> 00:42:11,838
She's a carrier.

309
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:14,641
She has the ability to infect others?

310
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:16,807
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

311
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:24,381
If this woman has natural immunity
she is incredibly valuable.

312
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:29,758
Her blood could contain
the key to a vaccine, even a cure.

313
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:39,838
Alice.

314
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:46,370
Hey, baby.

315
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:53,109
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was scared.

316
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,251
I shouldn't have run away.

317
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,350
I was scared.

318
00:43:04,998 --> 00:43:07,398
Please forgive me.

319
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:11,164
Please, sir. We need time to study her.
We need to run some tests.

320
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:14,365
You can run tests on her corpse, Major.

321
00:43:17,477 --> 00:43:19,775
I love you, Don.

322
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:28,212
Yeah.

323
00:43:30,323 --> 00:43:32,655
Oh, God, I love you, too.

324
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:49,266
Don!

325
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:12,708
Clear channels to control room.
Control room, this is General Stone.

326
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:17,313
All forces under my control, prepare
to execute Code Red on my command.

327
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:19,118
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

328
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:23,059
Break, break, break, all stations.
Sunray in 30 seconds.

329
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:27,065
We have an outbreak in the med centre.
All units, safeties off.

330
00:46:27,133 --> 00:46:29,795
- Affirmative.
- Open air cav transmission.

331
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:34,340
- Prepare containment areas.
- Move civilians to containment areas.

332
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,604
Command personnel secure in bunker.
Confirm order to lock down.

333
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:41,010
Lockdown confirmed.

334
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:43,412
Execute Code Red.

335
00:46:49,122 --> 00:46:54,287
Flynn, come in. Flynn, do you hear
that Code Red or am I losing my shit?

336
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,260
I was about to ask the same thing.

337
00:46:59,332 --> 00:47:01,857
Ten-hut!

338
00:47:21,554 --> 00:47:26,491
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
I'll be back in a moment.

339
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:31,828
- It's probably nothing.
- Tam, it didn't sound like nothing.

340
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:34,331
He said he'd be back in a moment.

341
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,500
Are you OK? Let's go.

342
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,034
Come on.

343
00:48:18,177 --> 00:48:21,840
- Move, move, move! Let's go!
- Andy, keep hold of my hand.

344
00:48:21,914 --> 00:48:24,212
OK, come on. Keep it moving.

345
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:26,410
Come on, people. Come on.

346
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:30,216
- Don't push.
- Sir, all civilians into the containment area.

347
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:35,852
These kids are with me. It's important they are
kept protected. I need to get them out of here.

348
00:48:35,928 --> 00:48:40,365
- Sir, no exceptions. It's a Code Red.
- I know what it is. My name is...

349
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:42,196
- Andy!
- Scarlet!

350
00:48:42,268 --> 00:48:43,860
Andy!

351
00:48:43,936 --> 00:48:45,233
- Tammy!
- Andy!

352
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:47,067
- Andy, wait!
- Scarlet!

353
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:50,108
- Just wait, Andy! We're coming!
- Calm down. Calm down, now.

354
00:48:58,985 --> 00:49:02,944
Move down. Move down the room.
Keep moving. Go, go, go. Come on.

355
00:49:03,056 --> 00:49:07,322
- You think it's a drill?
- Of course not. Someone saw an infected.

356
00:49:08,394 --> 00:49:11,522
Keep moving. That's it.
Good, good. Let's go.

357
00:49:11,597 --> 00:49:14,566
- Why are you sealing us inside?
- For your protection.

358
00:49:14,634 --> 00:49:18,502
- Just guard the door. Don't lock it.
- It's for your own protection.

359
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:21,300
- We've got to find Andy.
- We'll find him.

360
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:49,830
- Shut down civilian areas.
- Sector one, lockdown.

361
00:49:49,936 --> 00:49:54,498
- Sector eight, lockdown.
- Sector three, lockdown.

362
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:16,125
Switch to emergency lighting.
Use of nonlethal force authorized.

363
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:18,755
All snipers in position.

364
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:23,734
- Ground forces to med centre.
- Ground force to med centre.

365
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,695
Sector one covered.

366
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:36,010
Everyone, stay calm.

367
00:50:57,003 --> 00:50:58,868
Dad.

368
00:51:15,988 --> 00:51:18,047
No! My dad... my dad!

369
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:21,760
He's in here!

370
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,097
No!

371
00:52:32,164 --> 00:52:37,431
Containment area, containment area,
move into position.

372
00:52:46,946 --> 00:52:48,243
No!

373
00:53:02,028 --> 00:53:04,394
I confirm, only target infected.

374
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:06,897
Roger that. Only target infected.

375
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:17,871
Targeting right. I've had two down.

376
00:53:21,013 --> 00:53:23,709
Watch out for the friendlies.

377
00:53:23,816 --> 00:53:26,148
I can't get a shot.

378
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,549
Oh, man, this is FUBAR.

379
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:35,490
We got a group there at 12 o'clock.

380
00:53:35,561 --> 00:53:41,056
- We've got one at three o'clock.
- On the ground, got four.

381
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:44,496
16 down.

382
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,408
I got two by the Jeep.

383
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:56,245
- Jesus.
- I don't see who's a target.

384
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:04,350
On the move! On the move!
Moving right! Moving right!

385
00:54:05,091 --> 00:54:09,118
I can't find
the designated target here.

386
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:12,258
I cannot be target-specific.

387
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:16,165
Whiskey Three, why have you stopped firing?
Come in.

388
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:21,696
Abandon selective targeting.
Shoot everything. Targets are now free.

389
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:23,935
We've lost control.

390
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:35,247
All units, all units, this is Medical
Commanding Officer Sierra Lima.

391
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:39,257
Please be on the lookout for a young boy,
age 12, name, Andy.

392
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:47,255
If he is located he must be immediately
evacuated from the containment zone.

393
00:54:47,366 --> 00:54:49,425
We have to find Andy.

394
00:54:49,535 --> 00:54:52,402
- We have to find him!
- It's OK. It's OK.

395
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:56,168
We're gonna find him, OK?
We're gonna find him, I promise.

396
00:54:56,275 --> 00:55:01,975
I'm gonna get him out of here.
I'm gonna get you both out of here. Trust me.

397
00:55:22,835 --> 00:55:26,635
- New shot.
- Abandon selective targeting.

398
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:32,510
- Confirm order?
- Target everyone at ground level.

399
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:36,012
No exceptions. Repeat, no exceptions.

400
00:55:43,956 --> 00:55:45,184
Come on!

401
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:06,637
Three down.
One of ours down there. Three o'clock.

402
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:25,195
- Taking them down.
- Left sector, three o'clock.

403
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,767
Kid! Over here!

404
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:32,394
Kid! Over here!

405
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:49,779
- I got him.
- Well, take him out. Take him out.

406
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:53,381
Doyle, I got two fuckers on me!

407
00:56:54,793 --> 00:56:56,920
Fuck.

408
00:56:59,465 --> 00:57:01,558
Fuck.

409
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,969
Fuck!

410
00:58:25,584 --> 00:58:26,949
Tam?

411
00:58:48,507 --> 00:58:50,600
This is madness.

412
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,907
- What's happening?
- They're shooting everybody.

413
00:58:55,014 --> 00:59:00,145
- Why? It makes no sense.
- It makes perfect sense.

414
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:02,119
It's Code Red.

415
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:17,002
I saw Dad.

416
00:59:17,069 --> 00:59:19,503
Where?

417
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:22,233
He's one of them.

418
00:59:23,275 --> 00:59:26,608
Step one, kill the infected.

419
00:59:26,712 --> 00:59:29,875
Step two, containment.

420
00:59:30,382 --> 00:59:32,680
If containment fails...

421
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:37,054
step three, extermination.

422
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,421
Now they won't stop until everyone is dead.

423
00:59:43,128 --> 00:59:45,221
So what do we do?

424
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:50,226
I mean, I'm not sitting around here
to get exterminated.

425
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,270
We've gotta get outta here.

426
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:57,206
If we take one step out of that door,
if the infected don't get us, the snipers will.

427
00:59:57,276 --> 01:00:00,609
Well, you don't have a choice, my friend.

428
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:05,309
Right now it's dark out there. The snipers
can see you through their night scopes,

429
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:10,548
but at least you have
some limited cover from the infected.

430
01:00:10,622 --> 01:00:14,991
But, you know, if you wanna wait till sun-up
then you're as good as dead.

431
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:17,289
Who are you?

432
01:00:17,396 --> 01:00:20,524
Sergeant Doyle. Delta rooftop unit.

433
01:00:21,066 --> 01:00:23,557
Why aren't you at your post?

434
01:00:24,636 --> 01:00:26,501
Why aren't you?

435
01:00:27,973 --> 01:00:33,411
Look, you guys do what you want,
but I'm gonna get the fuck outta here.

436
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:36,404
You coming?

437
01:00:41,854 --> 01:00:43,845
All right, come on.

438
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:56,658
- Less shooting.
- Maybe it's under control.

439
01:00:56,769 --> 01:00:59,169
Or there are less shooters.

440
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:04,502
All right, listen. I need you guys
to look at me and only me, OK?

441
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,171
You run when I run.
Be my shadow. That's it, all right?

442
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,544
Get around back. Watch her.

443
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,842
Ready? Let's go.

444
01:01:25,964 --> 01:01:28,398
Stay.

445
01:01:31,637 --> 01:01:34,128
Doyle, come in.

446
01:01:38,377 --> 01:01:42,313
- Flynn, go.
- Doyle, where the fuck are you, man?

447
01:01:45,851 --> 01:01:49,685
- Ground level, District One.
- Shit. Close frequency.

448
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:51,881
Copy that.

449
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:58,562
What the fuck are you doing there?
You got some serious shit coming your way.

450
01:01:58,664 --> 01:02:02,327
- We already got some serious shit.
- I'm not playing. This is worse.

451
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:06,565
The air cav just got their orders.
They're firebombing all of District One.

452
01:02:06,672 --> 01:02:09,106
- That was fast.
- Outbreak is out of control.

453
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:14,612
They're taking no chances. So unless you are
out of the target zone, you are getting cooked.

454
01:02:14,713 --> 01:02:18,149
- How long we got?
- They're on their way. Four minutes, tops.

455
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:23,678
But listen. I got some clear landing ground
at Regent's Park. That's the pick-up point.

456
01:02:23,755 --> 01:02:28,852
- I'll be back in touch.
- Doyle, you fucking better be.

457
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:33,128
All right, look, guys, we gotta run.
Just stay low and stay fast, OK?

458
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:35,530
After me. Let's go.

459
01:02:42,374 --> 01:02:45,468
- Snipers! Get down! Snipers!
- Back! Back! Back!

460
01:02:45,577 --> 01:02:47,408
Get back! Get back!

461
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:50,414
Andy, get back!

462
01:02:50,482 --> 01:02:53,417
- Back!
- Andy, get in!

463
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:57,689
- Shit.
- Fuck!

464
01:02:57,756 --> 01:03:00,657
It's OK. It's just a flesh wound.

465
01:03:16,475 --> 01:03:18,443
Multiple shots, one hit.

466
01:03:19,845 --> 01:03:22,439
He's a panicker, no marksman.

467
01:03:27,819 --> 01:03:30,083
OK.

468
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:32,352
- What's your name?
- Sam.

469
01:03:32,457 --> 01:03:36,086
OK, Sam. Come here. Get closer.
Do you see that doorway?

470
01:03:36,161 --> 01:03:42,031
I need you to run as fast as you can in a
zigzag like this, OK? Don't stop for anything.

471
01:03:42,134 --> 01:03:47,697
- You want me to be bait?
- He'll take shots at you, but he'll miss.

472
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:51,765
He's gonna expose his position.
Means I get a shot at him. I won't miss.

473
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:54,971
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Stay back.

474
01:03:56,181 --> 01:04:00,550
Two minutes, we're all gonna die.
You want that?

475
01:04:00,652 --> 01:04:02,017
No!

476
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,553
Andy!

477
01:04:03,655 --> 01:04:04,747
Fuck!

478
01:04:30,082 --> 01:04:32,380
Good work, kid.

479
01:04:39,157 --> 01:04:42,092
- The fence!
- Watch it, watch it. Behind me.

480
01:04:42,194 --> 01:04:44,219
Go! Go! Go!

481
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:49,490
Come on. Come on, come on.

482
01:04:50,168 --> 01:04:52,227
Jump!

483
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,388
This is Red Fox One pouring whiskey.

484
01:05:13,792 --> 01:05:17,421
Keep going!
We'll be safe under the river.

485
01:07:01,867 --> 01:07:03,459
Go! Go!

486
01:07:06,738 --> 01:07:09,536
Come on. Come on!

487
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,014
Run! Run!

488
01:07:31,696 --> 01:07:35,655
Bring in biological units.
Fan out from predesignated positions.

489
01:07:35,734 --> 01:07:38,032
Bio units, copy.

490
01:07:39,004 --> 01:07:45,239
Use of chemical weapons authorized.
Repeat, chemical weapons are authorized.

491
01:10:38,316 --> 01:10:40,375
Stay close.

492
01:10:58,737 --> 01:11:01,035
They left us again.

493
01:11:04,209 --> 01:11:07,042
Do you think Mum's still alive?

494
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:11,106
Not this time.

495
01:11:45,817 --> 01:11:49,685
- You look a little pale.
- Blood makes me nauseous.

496
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:52,951
You never answered my question.

497
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,583
About why you left your post.

498
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,924
When I got that boy in my sights.

499
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:04,695
That's not a target anymore.

500
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:12,574
When we were separated...

501
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:15,272
I thought I'd lost you, too.

502
01:12:16,815 --> 01:12:20,182
We won't get separated again.

503
01:12:20,285 --> 01:12:23,846
We'll stay together, whatever happens.

504
01:12:24,856 --> 01:12:26,721
Whatever happens.

505
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:29,923
It was all fucked.

506
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:36,689
You could hear it all over the radios. Fucked.

507
01:12:41,973 --> 01:12:44,464
Anyway, what about you?

508
01:12:46,244 --> 01:12:52,513
- Why the hell are you here?
- Their mother had very special blood.

509
01:12:54,152 --> 01:12:57,679
A natural kind of immunity to the virus.

510
01:13:02,227 --> 01:13:04,991
Not all genetic traits are passed on, you know.

511
01:13:05,063 --> 01:13:09,397
They can skip a generation
or vanish altogether, but...

512
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:12,493
But they might have it.

513
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:14,663
It's a possibility.

514
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:20,902
So their lives are far more valuable than mine.

515
01:13:24,015 --> 01:13:26,449
Or yours.

516
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:29,885
I got it.

517
01:13:32,457 --> 01:13:34,550
Doyle!

518
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,025
Doyle!

519
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:40,064
- Flynn, go.
- You made it!

520
01:13:40,131 --> 01:13:44,295
I knew you'd do it. Listen. I'm coming
to you right now, but keep a lookout.

521
01:13:44,402 --> 01:13:47,997
There's sightings of infected
that have escaped the firebombing.

522
01:13:48,072 --> 01:13:51,064
- Give me an ETA.
- About 60.

523
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:54,202
- Minutes?
- No. Seconds.

524
01:13:56,147 --> 01:13:57,273
Kids, come on.

525
01:14:03,354 --> 01:14:05,549
Get down. Down! Down!

526
01:14:27,445 --> 01:14:29,970
I see you. I'm coming in.

527
01:14:30,081 --> 01:14:35,951
Jesus, Doyle, you got people with you.
Who the fuck are those people?

528
01:14:49,133 --> 01:14:52,000
Doyle! Who the fuck are those people?

529
01:14:52,103 --> 01:14:56,335
I can't take 'em. We will be shot out of the sky
if I try to land at the base.

530
01:14:56,441 --> 01:14:59,968
No, no, don't take 'em to base!
Take 'em over the Channel!

531
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:02,569
- What?
- We gotta get these kids outta here.

532
01:15:02,647 --> 01:15:05,480
Get the fuck in, Doyle!
I'm not taking 'em!

533
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:09,144
- Get me out of here!
- Sam, come back!

534
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:13,850
Hey, get the fuck off there!
Get that fucker off my ski!

535
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:17,052
- OK, you wanna fly with me, asshole?
- Sam!

536
01:15:17,161 --> 01:15:19,652
Come on!

537
01:15:33,711 --> 01:15:35,042
Fuck!

538
01:15:35,146 --> 01:15:38,172
We're gonna die down here!
Do something!

539
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,683
You wanna fuck?

540
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,915
Come on, you fuckers!

541
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:56,233
Get up! Run! Move it!

542
01:16:18,222 --> 01:16:21,385
Don't look back! Keep going!

543
01:16:22,493 --> 01:16:24,586
Keep going.

544
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:33,735
Fuck you, pussy!

545
01:16:49,987 --> 01:16:52,319
Doyle, come in! Doyle!

546
01:16:52,423 --> 01:16:56,382
You need to get to safe ground.
Get to the stadium. Ditch those people.

547
01:16:56,461 --> 01:16:58,725
I'm not taking 'em.

548
01:17:11,776 --> 01:17:14,244
Flynn, come in.
Flynn, I know you can hear me.

549
01:17:14,312 --> 01:17:18,009
Fuck the Code Red, fuck the chain
of command. I need an extraction.

550
01:17:18,116 --> 01:17:20,584
You better fucking be there,
'cause we will be.

551
01:17:20,651 --> 01:17:23,745
You OK? Yeah?

552
01:17:23,821 --> 01:17:26,346
I bet you're tired, huh? Me, too.

553
01:17:26,457 --> 01:17:31,019
OK, I need you to help me, OK?
Help me with your sister. You got that?

554
01:17:31,129 --> 01:17:34,587
Come on. Gotta go. Gotta go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

555
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:05,220
Gas! Get back! Get back!

556
01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:09,060
- Tammy, Andy, get in the car!
- It's gas! Run! Come on!

557
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:12,967
Come on, get in the car! Get in the car!

558
01:18:13,037 --> 01:18:15,733
Come on! Get in! Get in!

559
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:18,466
Get in, Andy!

560
01:18:19,377 --> 01:18:21,504
Go, go, go!

561
01:18:25,349 --> 01:18:27,476
Lock the doors!

562
01:18:28,653 --> 01:18:31,144
Get the vents, get the vents.

563
01:19:13,631 --> 01:19:17,590
- It won't start!
- We'll be fine, all right? Just keep trying.

564
01:19:17,702 --> 01:19:19,761
It won't start!

565
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:30,104
Come on, come on, come on.
Keep trying. Keep trying!

566
01:19:30,214 --> 01:19:35,049
- It won't start! It won't fucking start!
- Fuck me!

567
01:19:36,888 --> 01:19:40,824
- It won't start!
- Put your foot on the clutch.

568
01:19:41,325 --> 01:19:46,957
All right. You pop the clutch when I tell you,
OK? You get them to the stadium. OK?

569
01:19:51,168 --> 01:19:53,796
Keep your head down.

570
01:19:59,076 --> 01:20:01,340
I'll meet you there.

571
01:20:01,445 --> 01:20:02,639
OK.

572
01:20:08,085 --> 01:20:09,780
- Doyle!
- Doyle!

573
01:20:21,265 --> 01:20:24,792
Pop it! Pop it!

574
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:28,962
Go! Go!

575
01:20:29,974 --> 01:20:32,340
Go!

576
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,554
Oh, my God...

577
01:21:12,817 --> 01:21:13,841
OK.

578
01:21:35,373 --> 01:21:37,307
Fuck!

579
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:53,651
- Scarlet!
- Fuck!

580
01:21:57,294 --> 01:21:59,387
They're shooting at us!

581
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:17,547
Hold on!

582
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,918
Shit.

583
01:22:31,796 --> 01:22:33,889
OK, let's go.

584
01:22:43,808 --> 01:22:46,800
Come on, through here, guys.

585
01:23:02,426 --> 01:23:04,690
Just hold onto the rails.

586
01:23:08,599 --> 01:23:10,658
Careful, guys.

587
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:15,531
OK.

588
01:23:16,107 --> 01:23:17,665
OK.

589
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:20,676
It's OK. I can see. I can see.

590
01:23:20,778 --> 01:23:23,838
Keep going down.

591
01:23:28,519 --> 01:23:29,816
OK.

592
01:23:29,887 --> 01:23:34,153
Just keep walking straight, guys.

593
01:23:34,258 --> 01:23:36,522
Holding against the wall.

594
01:23:36,627 --> 01:23:39,858
You're doing really well. You're doing great.

595
01:23:39,964 --> 01:23:42,728
OK, get back! Get back against the wall!

596
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:45,199
OK. Good.

597
01:23:45,302 --> 01:23:49,932
Just stay close. Slightly to the right, Andy.

598
01:23:50,374 --> 01:23:53,866
It's OK. I can see. It's OK.
I've got the night sight on.

599
01:23:53,978 --> 01:23:58,813
You're doing great. Just hold... hold the rail.
Nice and slow down the stairs, OK?

600
01:23:58,883 --> 01:24:01,818
Stop! Stop! Stop right now!

601
01:24:01,886 --> 01:24:04,320
OK, Tammy, to your left. Good.

602
01:24:04,388 --> 01:24:08,381
OK. Good girl. Just straight down.
Nice and slow. Slower.

603
01:24:09,126 --> 01:24:13,392
Stop! Stop, honey.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. All right?

604
01:24:14,165 --> 01:24:17,328
Grab hold of the other railing, OK?
Go to your right.

605
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:22,100
- Scarlet, I can't see anything!
- Go to your right. Go to your right.

606
01:24:22,206 --> 01:24:27,234
All right. Keep trying to skip... Just put your
leg far out in front of you, OK? Good girl.

607
01:24:27,344 --> 01:24:29,710
Hold onto the rail. Careful!

608
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:34,882
Tammy!

609
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:37,351
Andy!

610
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:39,514
Where are you?

611
01:24:44,061 --> 01:24:46,757
Andy! Where are you? Andy!

612
01:24:46,864 --> 01:24:48,889
Answer me!

613
01:24:48,966 --> 01:24:51,764
Where are you?

614
01:24:55,072 --> 01:24:56,596
Tammy!

615
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:01,611
- Where are you?
- Scarlet!

616
01:25:01,712 --> 01:25:05,773
- Tammy, I'm coming. I'm right here.
- Scarlet, I've lost Andy!

617
01:25:05,883 --> 01:25:08,875
- I'm right here.
- I've lost Andy.

618
01:25:08,953 --> 01:25:12,548
There we go.
Just come slowly towards me.

619
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:14,750
I've lost Andy.

620
01:25:15,593 --> 01:25:17,652
We'll find Andy.

621
01:25:26,237 --> 01:25:27,761
Scarlet!

622
01:25:39,316 --> 01:25:40,943
Andy!

623
01:25:41,018 --> 01:25:43,578
Where are you?

624
01:26:01,305 --> 01:26:04,399
Scarlet.

625
01:26:17,154 --> 01:26:18,781
Tammy?

626
01:26:18,856 --> 01:26:21,017
Tammy?

627
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,956
Scarlet?

628
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:51,544
No!

629
01:26:55,059 --> 01:26:56,185
Don!

630
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:58,054
We stay together - whatever happens.

631
01:27:58,122 --> 01:28:00,613
- No!
- Andy!

632
01:28:00,724 --> 01:28:02,817
Andy, no!

633
01:28:02,926 --> 01:28:04,985
No! Andy!

634
01:28:08,165 --> 01:28:10,793
Andy! Andy!

635
01:28:11,268 --> 01:28:12,599
No!

636
01:28:12,803 --> 01:28:14,634
No!

637
01:28:14,738 --> 01:28:17,332
Andy!

638
01:28:47,304 --> 01:28:49,602
Tam, am I one of them?

639
01:29:01,218 --> 01:29:03,311
No.

640
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:10,051
No, you're not.

641
01:30:13,257 --> 01:30:15,350
Stop!

642
01:30:17,094 --> 01:30:19,927
Where's Doyle?

643
01:30:21,365 --> 01:30:23,629
Where's Doyle?

644
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:33,169
It's just us.

645
01:30:46,924 --> 01:30:49,791
Come on.

646
01:30:49,893 --> 01:30:51,793
Get in. Come on.

Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me?

650
01:32:52,516 --> 01:32:54,575
Is anybody there?

651
01:32:58,021 --> 01:33:00,455
