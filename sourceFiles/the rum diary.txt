1
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,443
-Who is it?
-Room service.

2
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,197
ls it eggs?

3
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,616
l don't know, sir. l didn't order it.

4
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,636
You want some water with that?

5
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,138
No, no. No, l don't.

6
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,265
Looks like you had a night.

7
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,188
They look perfect.

8
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,732
Get out.

9
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,240
l intended to bring that
to the attention of a member of staff.

10
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,994
l had some difficulty getting it to open.

11
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,331
lt's the little key on the door key, sir.

12
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,583
Right.

13
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,007
l was looking for some nuts.

14
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,805
l tend to avoid alcohol.

15
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,478
When l can.

16
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,074
l don't speak Spanish.

17
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,185
Cuatro cincuenta. No change.

18
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,266
No, no, no, no, you're not listening.

19
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,435
l said the Pirates, not the Yankees.

20
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,353
lt's going to be Roberto's
year, l'm telling you.

21
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,022
Looking for Mr. Lotterman.

22
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,523
End of the room.

23
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,151
No, no, the Pirates.

24
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,402
You guys are going to be all over.

25
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,404
lt's Roberto Clemente, man.

26
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,614
And by the way, l want to talk about...

27
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,290
Not now!

28
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,044
He's having the Friday crisis.

29
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,299
-You Kemp?
-Yeah.

30
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,843
He was expecting you yesterday.

31
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,219
We had some weather.

32
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,554
Yeah, l heard.

33
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,306
Big snow in New York.

34
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,809
He's still on a call. You want some coffee?

35
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,019
No, thanks.

36
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,645
What's all the fuss out front?

37
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,980
You came in the front?

38
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,316
We don't use that door.

39
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,693
Not when losjibaros pitch up.

40
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,236
What do they want?

41
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,321
l don't know.

42
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,823
Some fucked idea of a living wage.

43
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,785
They've been out there
on and off for months.

44
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,913
By the way, my name's Sala.

45
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,873
Bob Sala, staff photographer.

46
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,166
Pleased to meet you, Bob.

47
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,375
Yeah.

48
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,586
He's off.

49
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,006
You might want to try
another subservient knock.

50
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,508
Yeah.

51
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,719
Kemp.

52
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,721
Don't notice the wig.

53
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,394
Yeah. What?

54
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,408
lf you're
who l think you are, you better sit down.

55
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,797
You find it a little bright in here?

56
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,175
l'd take them off,
but l have a medical condition.

57
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,885
What do you mean, you're blind?

58
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,054
Conjunctivitis, sir.

59
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,932
The old red eye, huh?

60
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,690
You arrive at a very,
very trying time, Mr. Kemp.

61
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,984
One of those days stacking up.

62
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,696
So, why don't we cut through the niceties
and just get right to it, huh?

63
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,489
That's how l like to proceed.

64
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,241
Okay. Your resume here.

65
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,414
Very impressive CV.

66
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,791
Yeah.

67
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,252
You worked your way up
some interesting titles.

68
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,339
l really like the "fluent Spanish."

69
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,757
Wow.

70
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,222
This CV is a bunch of bullshit.

71
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,600
ls it?

72
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,852
This is two days on the wire.

73
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,521
A day dead. We don't have it.

74
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,903
What is the matter with Moburg?

75
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,364
He's about as useful as a dug-up body.

76
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,336
You see, the problem with
this newspaper, Mr. Kemp,

77
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,172
is that l am among many
who don't enjoy reading it.

78
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,549
We have an ailing circulation,

79
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,886
and l just have to look around
this building to understand why.

80
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,681
Lack of commitment
and too much self-indulgence.

81
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,436
So what l'm looking for

82
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,605
is some enthusiasm, some energy,

83
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,024
some fresh blood.

84
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,070
And the question that l'm asking myself

85
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,364
is how much alcohol is usual in yours.

86
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,823
My fresh blood?

87
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,283
How much do you drink?

88
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,286
l suppose at the upper end of "social."

89
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,205
l'm poised to give up.

90
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,708
Well, Puerto Rico may not be
the best place on Earth to do that.

91
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,714
Don't look so anxious, Mr. Kemp.

92
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,176
l wouldn't have paid
for your hotel if l hadn't already hired you.

93
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,303
But this is not the Last Chance Saloon,

94
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,097
and l do not need another heavy drinker.

95
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,600
Which l perceive, from the condition
of eyeballs behind glasses,

96
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,310
that you might very well qualify as.

97
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,896
This is a medical condition, Mr. Lotterman.

98
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,690
l know it might look
like something else, but this is a...

99
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,857
Looks like a fuckin' hangover.

100
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,192
Does it?

101
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,701
Come here.

102
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,206
That's the kind of
commitment l like to see in a man.

103
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,711
Determination,
balanced with appropriate humanity.

104
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,629
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

105
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,175
Which side do you dress, Kemp?

106
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,677
l beg your pardon?

107
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,178
Politics.

108
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,472
l kind of hang in the middle.

109
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,562
This is a schizoid society, Kemp.

110
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,857
They got two languages,
two flags, two loyalties, two anthems.

111
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,317
We bring them stuff they never had.

112
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,818
They either hate it or they want more of it.

113
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,320
lt's a reluctant part ofAmerica.

114
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,447
lt's like an England with tropical fruit.

115
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,823
Bob.

116
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,199
Just the man l wanted to see.

117
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,327
This is Paul Kemp.
He's joining us from New York.

118
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,661
Yeah, yeah, we already met.

119
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,497
That's Mr. Clive Donovan, sports.

120
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,124
And this is Mr. Hubert, accounting.

121
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,500
Listen, do me a favor, will you?

122
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,002
Show him around, the dos and don'ts.

123
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,420
lntroduce him to some of the guys.

124
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,671
l'll take him up to Al's.

125
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,797
The hell you will.

126
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,923
You take him to the library.

127
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,133
You pull out some volumes.

128
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,468
l want him to get a sense of the paper.

129
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,595
You know,
make some notes, go back a few years,

130
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,513
paying particular attention to bowling alleys.

131
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,765
There's bowling and bowling alleys.

132
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,266
Very big here. They're up like mushrooms.

133
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,517
A new one premieres every week.

134
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,019
-Been to Puerto Rico before?
-No.

135
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,479
You're going to fall right into it.

136
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,564
There's a boom on here, Kemp.
lt's an open door.

137
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,858
You play it right, you can surf the place.

138
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,820
What do you know about horoscopes?

139
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,905
Nothing.

140
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,365
Well, if l can write one, you can.

141
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,534
So it's every day with a special "Star's Star"

142
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,370
featured Saturday with Betty Grable

143
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,330
and Neil Sedaka, things like that.

144
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,124
So here, everything you need is right there.

145
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,336
lt's called "Madam La Zonga Predicts."

146
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,462
What happened to Madam La Zonga?

147
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,546
He got canceled.

148
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,423
What do you mean, fired?

149
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,800
They raped him to death.

150
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,594
They raped him to death?

151
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,888
There are very few places on this island

152
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,348
l decline to visit,

153
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,933
but the toilets frequented by sailors

154
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,811
on the west side of Candado Pier is one.

155
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,146
They raped him to death?

156
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,482
La Zonga died in a cubicle.

157
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,319
Say, you're not artistic, are you, Kemp?

158
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,904
Oh, no.

159
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,490
You might want to
rethink those menthol cigarettes.

160
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,992
They don't do a thing for you.

161
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,221
Come by the house.

162
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,389
l will.

163
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,184
l like your stuff.

164
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,020
The cuttings you sent to Lotterman.

165
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,022
lt's good writing.

166
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,357
Thanks.

167
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,945
We'll talk.

168
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,991
One more floor!

169
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,620
They put in automated
packing machines about six months ago.

170
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,789
They mechanized almost everything.

171
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,625
There used to be 50 guys down here.
Now there's five.

172
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,377
Hence happiness in the street.

173
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,755
Souvenir, day one.

174
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,093
Here's to pretty women with filthy thoughts.

175
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,181
-Want a burger?
-No.

176
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,682
-Burger?
-No, thanks.

177
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,350
Try it. Dos.

178
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,395
So how was the induction?

179
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,813
Somewhat fraught.

180
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:38,484
No disrespect, Paul,
but he didn't have a lot of choice.

181
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,903
You know how many people
applied for the job?

182
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,404
One. You.

183
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,655
ls that right?

184
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,866
Even then, l thought l'd blown it.

185
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,326
Zeroed in on my weakest spot.

186
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,827
Which is what?

187
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,914
Two and a half unpublished novels
and references of equal fiction.

188
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,415
You're a novelist.

189
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,792
ln a manner of speaking.

190
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,544
Can't even get read.

191
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,005
So l figured l'd do some words for money,

192
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,423
see how it's looking in a year or two.

193
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,799
At El Star?

194
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,760
Hate to tell you this on the way in,

195
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,304
but this publication's on its way out.

196
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,765
And as far as l'm concerned,
it can't come soon enough.

197
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,350
Not going to happen.

198
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,435
You like a little vonga on that?

199
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,188
l'll give you 1 3 to 2 this thing's over by June.

200
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,314
They're going to cut the cord.

201
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,982
Then why put in all the new machinery?

202
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,693
Precisely my point, and he can't answer it.

203
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,404
Well, like l'm tired of arguing the obvious.

204
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,906
Come on. Let's eat.

205
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,742
Now, l got to go
and see a man about a horse.

206
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,787
Good to meet you, Paul.

207
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,502
Another night unfolds over Old San Juan.

208
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,671
You been here long?

209
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,256
Too long.

210
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,174
This place is like someone you fucked

211
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,717
and they're still under you.

212
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,052
Why don't you quit?

213
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,679
Life's full of exits.

214
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,848
Because l'm waiting
for it to collapse so l get the payoff.

215
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,810
Three grand redundancy puts me in Mexico.

216
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,147
Don't look left.

217
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,984
That's an introduction
you don't want to have.

218
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,610
Who's he?

219
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,281
Living example
of everything that's wrong with this paper.

220
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,199
His name's Moburg.

221
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,869
Our Crime
and Religious Affairs correspondent.

222
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,497
Lotterman can't fire him
because he never sees him.

223
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,207
He's rarely out in daylight.

224
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,792
Looks like he enjoys a drink.

225
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,129
The entire substructure
of his brain is eaten away with rum.

226
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,632
l'm telling you, this enterprise is doomed.

227
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:30,262
There's maybe three or four professionals in
the building running the entire show.

228
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,807
Wait a minute. Who is Hal Sanderson?

229
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,268
ln the library. Who's he?

230
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,937
He used to work for the paper.

231
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,316
Now he's what he says he is.
A PR consultant.

232
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,319
Selling this place
street by street to the Yankees.

233
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,197
Keeps a greasy little
bastard of a contact called Segurra.

234
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,117
l saw him. We didn't meet.

235
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,535
Wouldn't bother.

236
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,037
Piss on the make.

237
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,998
The boy, Segurra,
is at the property wickedness.

238
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,876
l'm not sure where Sanderson fits.

239
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,253
But Sanderson's worth cultivation.

240
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,463
He's got some good connections.

241
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,256
He's good for some freelance.

242
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,386
This place is depressing me
beyond belief tonight.

243
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,597
You're at Plage Xanadu, right?

244
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,475
Come on. l'll give you a ride.

245
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,412
l was thinking, if you need somewhere,

246
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,247
l got a room for rent.

247
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,085
Not the best address
in town, but it's got a fridge and TV.

248
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,461
60 a month.

249
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,755
Sounds inviting. l might remention that.

250
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,590
Meanwhile, bleed it dry.

251
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,769
Sir...

252
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,813
l was hoping for a swim.

253
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,439
The pool is closed tonight.

254
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,316
Really? Why? What's going on?

255
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,777
lt's a Union Carbide party.

256
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,278
lt's a private function.

257
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,496
Sorry.

258
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,707
l didn't realize anyone was there.

259
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,917
l thought it was just floating.

260
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,170
lt is just floating.

261
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,630
You doing what l'm doing?

262
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,175
l don't think so.

263
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,885
What are you doing?

264
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,345
Escaping the dreadful party.

265
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,973
l just snuck out and unzipped.

266
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,226
Well, that's very courageous of you.

267
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,271
l thought maybe you were a mermaid.

268
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,356
They tell me the coast is infested with them.

269
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,192
l'm from Connecticut.

270
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,028
My boyfriend's making a speech.

271
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,363
Takes exactly 21 minutes.

272
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,033
Well, then l guess
it's pointless, me inviting you for a drink.

273
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,285
What you got?

274
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,120
No, l mean at the bar.

275
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,458
Pointless.

276
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,045
l'd better go before
they wonder where l went.

277
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,299
Wait a minute. What's your name?

278
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,760
Let's keep that a secret.

279
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,470
l don't even know it.

280
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,222
Well, then you'll keep it even better.

281
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,807
What about your star sign?

282
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,725
l'm an experienced astronomer.

283
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,228
Could try Pisces.

284
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,938
The fish.

285
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,650
Oh, God.

286
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,902
Why did she have to happen?

287
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,113
Just when l was doing so good without her.

288
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,700
What would you say you
like most about Puerto Rico?

289
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,453
The bowling alleys and the casinos.

290
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,539
Course, she likes the duty free.

291
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,791
Well, the more you spend, the more you save.

292
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,501
Have you seen a lot of the island?

293
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,128
We don't leave the hotel.

294
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,964
lt isn't safe.

295
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,048
But you're having fun?

296
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,759
Oh, yeah! A lotta, lotta fun!

297
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,680
Have some fun with a fucking Luger.

298
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,266
These alleys are magnets to the glutton.

299
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,143
They come off the boats like locusts.

300
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,439
Beasts of obesity.

301
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,984
Asses that wouldn't feel an arrow.

302
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,612
The great whites.

303
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,490
Probably the most dangerous
creatures on Earth.

304
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,045
There's your baby.

305
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,130
Walt and his woman.

306
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,216
Bowling alleys
isn't exactly what l had in mind.

307
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,885
Tread it till the snow melts,

308
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,386
then join the exodus.

309
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,805
Red light!

310
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,390
Looking for Kemp.

311
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,728
Too many adjectives, too much cynicism.

312
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,563
Nobody wants what's wrong with the place,

313
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,106
they want to read about what's right.

314
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,733
-lt's a rewrite.
-Yeah, l'm aware of that.

315
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,484
And while you're at it,

316
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,403
you might want to rewrite the title and call it

317
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,655
"Ten Things That l Love About Puerto Rico."

318
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,329
So,

319
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,956
how's the sobriety coming along?

320
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,958
l'm cutting down.

321
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,629
By that,
l assume you mean the size of the bottles.

322
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,509
How does anybody drink 1 61 miniatures?

323
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,429
You're averaging 93 miniatures a week.

324
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,598
What, do they
stock the place four times a day?

325
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,849
Are they not complimentary?

326
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,267
No, Mr. Kemp, they are not.

327
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,561
And neither is wine
and long-distance phone calls.

328
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:15,190
So, as of Monday,
you are no longer a resident of the Xanadu.

329
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,651
And what exactly
brings you into the building?

330
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,777
Don't hazel me.

331
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,613
l got the X-rays back.
l got less than a week to live.

332
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,282
Hazel you? What are you talking
about, you Swedish twerp?

333
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,535
You know,
it may have crossed what's left of your mind

334
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,162
that l have a newspaper to run here,

335
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,165
that we have
something called news going on out there.

336
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,792
But as far as you're concerned,

337
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,086
l might as well look out
of the fuckin' window!

338
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,129
What are you doing here?

339
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,465
This is a newspaper.
There's nothing here for you.

340
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,094
Two of the best scoops
you ever had came out of my brain.

341
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,347
And you better
moderate your language or l'll go elsewhere.

342
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,558
Elsewhere where?
You couldn't get work as a fly repellent.

343
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,310
You're worthless, Moburg.

344
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,312
The last onion in the jar.

345
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,523
Don't push me, Lotterman.

346
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,983
l'm dangerous when pushed.

347
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,567
l know why you're here.

348
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,236
lt's payday.

349
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,655
But in your case,
deferred on a permanent basis.

350
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,823
You're fired!

351
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,324
You can't fire me.

352
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,742
You owe me money.

353
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,328
And you better pay it,
or l'll come through the roof

354
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,580
and turn this place into an insurance claim.

355
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,124
Are you threatening me?

356
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,333
Hey, guys, let's take it easy.

357
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,419
You want to suffer some voodoo?

358
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,712
You twerp!

359
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,588
Eat the death pill, Lotterman!

360
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,383
Come on, we're walking.

361
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,427
Did you hear what he said to me?

362
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,178
This guy's my blood pressure.

363
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,763
This guy's going to kill me.

364
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,559
And l want the negative
of that picture destroyed!

365
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,396
l don't want that animal
in this building again.

366
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,189
He is hygienically unacceptable.

367
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,233
Did you see the side of his nose?

368
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,735
Blackheads like Braille.

369
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,653
They should have him put down.

370
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,865
Moburg is history.

371
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,117
He's out of here at the earliest opportunity.

372
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,079
And the earliest opportunity

373
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,374


is you.

374
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,127
You understand what l'm saying, Kemp?

375
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,046
l think l get the drift.

376
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,298
l want you to
immerse yourself into this paper,

377
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,467
'cause you got
the talent and l think you got the will.

378
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,677
You make it grow
and you grow right along with it.

379
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,680
l'm not best placed to do that.

380
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:14,059
You think it's my intention to keep you on
horoscopes and rewrites and bowling alleys?

381
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,354
Matter of fact, l'm gonna move you right now.

382
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,650
Take a cab to the airport.

383
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,986
The mayor of Miami's coming in.

384
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,697
Make him sound nice.

385
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,075
l want a picture and an interview.

386
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,493
Make it work, Paul.

387
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,181
You leaving us already?

388
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,185
l'm moving into an apartment if
this mayor guy ever shows up.

389
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,522
They keep changing "delayed" to "delayed."

390
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,028
You want to have some breakfast?

391
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,863
Little lobster on the beach?

392
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,490
Twenty minutes away.

393
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,158
Sounds inviting,
but l got to wait for the mayor.

394
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,952
lsn't coming.

395
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,078
Canceled.

396
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,330
That's not what it says on the board.

397
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,873
lt will in a minute.

398
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,083
l just called Miami.

399
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,502
Come on, let's have some breakfast.

400
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,046
l got a couple things might interest you.

401
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,550
l better call in.

402
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,343
You can call from the car.

403
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,313
All right. Yeah, thanks.

404
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,653
There's only two of those on the island.

405
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,738
Maybe three.

406
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,616
No one told me it was so pretty here.

407
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,911
God's idea of money.

408
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,667
You know what makes
this place a gold mine?

409
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,336
Something that doesn't exist.

410
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,462
How's that?

411
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,839
Land.

412
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,757
There isn't enough of it.

413
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,470
Those who know how to get it
get the gold.

414
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,222
Chenault?

415
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,480
Paul's joining us for breakfast.

416
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,149
Looks like it's gonna be a lunch.

417
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,944
This is Chenault.

418
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,532
You two know each other?

419
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,160
l don't know,
l thought maybe we met on the plane.

420
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,620
l don't think so.

421
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,288
l flew Boyfriend Airlines.

422
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,874
Tell me, do you like lobster, Paul?

423
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,751
You know what, l might not have time today.

424
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,920
l didn't realize the drive
was gonna take so long.

425
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,004
How much time you got?

426
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,839
ln 1 5 minutes, l'm late.

427
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,758
l'll cut up a pineapple.

428
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,302
You might want to put on some clothes.

429
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,847
She sunbathes in the nude.

430
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,102
A few of the over-tanned locals
tend to treat it as a tourist attraction.

431
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,603
Doesn't surprise me.

432
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,064
l mean that in a very tasteful way.

433
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,607
lt's a private beach.

434
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:50,942
They shouldn't be here.

435
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,361
Sit down, Paul, sit down.
We'll grab you a cab.

436
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,908
His name's Harry.

437
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,369
Got the idea from a book.

438
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,205
Paul, l wanted to talk,

439
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,041
because l'm looking for someone who can

440
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,546
assimilate contradictory points of view

441
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,339
and make them into one voice.

442
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,300
You're a novelist, right?

443
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,884
Who told you that?

444
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,345
Oh, please. Newspapers are full of gossip.

445
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,473
l'm looking for someone who's good with
words, next day, you turn up.

446
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,850
And 'cause l believe in good luck,

447
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,476
l thought maybe you were it.

448
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,270
What l need

449
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,440
is someone with the right kind of eyes.

450
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,942
For looking at what?

451
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,403
Looking at that.

452
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,284
An ocean of money.

453
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,840
Hey, you made it.

454
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,842
Door at the end.

455
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,845
-Hey.
-Hey.

456
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,931
Hey. Just give me two minutes.

457
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,808
Walk right in.

458
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,101
All right.

459
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,585
l was trying to
get the place shipshape before you arrived.

460
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,087
Adolf Hitler Speaks?

461
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,840
Not mine. Nazi stuff belongs to Moburg.

462
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,383
Moburg lives here?

463
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,885
He keeps his uniform here.

464
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,471
l never see him
from one month's end to the next.

465
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,977
So, you can see, it's quite spacious.

466
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,271
Don't look in the kitchen.

467
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,356
The water's off.
There's a problem with the valve.

468
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,109
Thought you said you had a TV.

469
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,194
l said l kind of have a TV.

470
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,702
The guy across the alley
has a TV, l have binoculars.

471
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,287
His wife's deaf.

472
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,664
With the window open, you hear every word.

473
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,875
Here it comes.

474
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,334
Water's coming up.

475
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,004
l noticed
you had some chickens in the bedroom.

476
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,130
Cockerels.

477
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,465
Yeah, l'm sweating the grease out.

478
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,633
Don't worry about them,
l'm moving them to my room.

479
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,801
What do you do with them?

480
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,052
-You eat them?
-Eat them?

481
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,222
Nah. l don't eat them.

482
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,533
Come on, baby, come on!

483
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,368
Get in there, get in there!

484
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,495
Come on!

485
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,138
Hey, on a trade wind, my boy!
On a trade wind!

486
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,431
Come on, bump it up, there, Bobby.

487
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,808
Bump, bump, bump, bump. Yes, sir!

488
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,356
Hey. They call him El Monstruo.

489
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,026
Say he's never lost a fight in three years.

490
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,863
Come on, we're out of here.

491
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,993
Come on, rapido, rapido.

492
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,122
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

493
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,207
Come on. Come on. Go on.

494
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,900
l tell you, we were
on a roll til that thing turned up.

495
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,861
That's $21 7.

496
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,154
Not bad.

497
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,073
$21 7 is a shitload of money.

498
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,407
Relatively a shitload.

499
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,368
They're expensive to train.

500
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,663
l've seen guys win 2,000, ten on North Beach.

501
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,247
1 0,000?

502
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,375
Why didn't he take El Monstruo down there?

503
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,586
You're talking
the environs of the Hilton Hotel.

504
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,672
They wear bowties and shiny shoes.

505
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,590
There's no hope for his kind of hat.

506
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,513
The question, again, is not one of goals.

507
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,639
We're for those goals.

508
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,765
lt's one of means.

509
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,934
Were you claiming
that the Eisenhower administration...

510
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,771
How long can this blizzard of shame go on?

511
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,817
Look at this ingrate
besotted with his own righteousness.

512
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,028
Black is a very dark shade of white.

513
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,114
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Nixon.

514
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,409
l can't listen to any more of this.

515
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,785
Lies like he breathes.

516
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,122
lmagine spending your entire life lying.

517
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,748
Holy Christ.

518
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,084
Never got worse.

519
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,339
The only eventuality
worse than him is you know that one day,

520
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,217
some filthy whore-beast is gonna show up,

521
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,927
make him look like a liberal.

522
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,305
The only upside
with Nixon is he ain't gonna win.

523
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,141
He's got the grin.

524
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,392
He ain't gonna win.

525
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,018
lrish guy's going to win.

526
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,895
But they'll never let him live.

527
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,606
How do you know that?

528
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,650
l do "horror-scopes."

529
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,572
Thought you said he never came here.

530
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,074
He's got filters.

531
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,367
What filters?

532
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,288
He goes over the wall at the Barcardi plant.

533
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:46,917
These filters
are the last in line in the distillation process.

534
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,213
They contain more ethanol than rocket fuel.

535
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,339
What's it like?

536
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,091
A hand on the brain.

537
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,843
Off the scale.

538
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,595
470 proof.

539
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,638
No such thing as 470 proof alcohol.

540
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,979
Certainty you might be required to moderate.

541
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,610
No smoking
in the extraction area, if you please.

542
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,028
Don't be ridiculous.

543
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,626
Not for the social drinker.

544
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,879
You want to quaff?

545
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,130
No.

546
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,965
Not right now. l got to write.

547
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,175
l got a deadline.

548
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,052
What's he writing?

549
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,013
He's lifting the stone on the American Dream.

550
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,264
Guayanilla Bay.

551
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,767
Oh, yeah. lt's bad down there.

552
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,687
You might find such
a topic attracts a limited readership.

553
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,189
Only need one.

554
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,066
Taking it to Lotterman.

555
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,985
Yeah. Did l hear somebody say "good luck"?

556
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,114
Yeah, l went down there this morning,

557
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,577
he unfired me
on a temporary basis, maggot that he is.

558
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,247
l'd like to bring something in to Lotterman.

559
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,792
Like a slide-action, "fuck you" gun.

560
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,753
Don't drink that here.

561
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,174
Just a nipperoo, old boy.

562
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,926
Quality test.

563
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,181
Man, slow-motion murder,
just like they do in the movies.

564
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,226
See him flying back,

565
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,979
fuckin' arms flapping in the air.

566
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,273
Okay, mother.

567
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,568
Look upon the last
face you'll see this side of hell!

568
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,902
Bam!

569
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:43,492
Down he goes, morsels of vital organs
spinning off into flesh orbit.

570
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:44,827
Bam!

571
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,954
There goes his asshole.

572
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,038
Bam!

573
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,915
There goes his dick.

574
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,917
Bam! Bam!

575
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,211
Fuck you, Lotterman!

576
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:58,132
You're in a B-fucking movie,
and l am the death machine!

577
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,095
Shall we have some Adolf?

578
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,388
Definitely not.

579
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,682
On your way, on your way, Moburg.

580
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,475
Hey, we're expecting guests.

581
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,519
l thought you said he was writing a book.

582
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:11,770
Said l was writing an essay.

583
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,647
And it requires some shut mouth.

584
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:17,067
Don't waste your time
on those junkyard losers.

585
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,404
This country was
built on genocide and slavery.

586
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,281
We killed all the black guys that were here,

587
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,659
and then
we shipped in new black guys of our own,

588
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,245
and then we
brought in Jesus, like a bar of soap.

589
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,413
Let's go.

590
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,789
You know it.

591
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,042
l am the religious correspondent.

592
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,045
Fuck off with your Jesus Police!

593
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:39,048
lf the Bible's God's
book, why didn't He give it to everyone?

594
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:47,014
"We give more money
to parking meters than we do to kids to eat."

595
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,516
Don't read me like that.
l've done the research.

596
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,396
1 2,000-ton rust bucket went down in the
bay full of hydrochloric acid.

597
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,898
Killed off everything in the sea.

598
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,192
Killed off the fishermen.
Their kids are picking garbage.

599
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,652
All right, don't get angry.

600
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:00,945
lt's hot outside.

601
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,238
You want a Scotch?

602
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,406
Yeah.

603
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,036
Ten years ago... Five. Five years ago,

604
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,080
l might have said go after it.

605
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,749
Now l say go with it.

606
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,793
There's nothing you can change.

607
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,797
Sometimes you just
got to spew over the side and keep rowing.

608
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,092
lnto a nut brown sunset.

609
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,970
lt's the land of multiple outrage.

610
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,556
Thousands trodden on
before you wake up for breakfast.

611
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:33,060
That isn't news, it's a commercial reality.

612
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,729
And providing it isn't their sunset,

613
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,649
nobody gives one-fifth of a fuck.

614
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,567
You underestimate your readers.

615
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,694
l don't think so.

616
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,487
You underestimate me.

617
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,156
You told me to make it work,
that's what l want to do.

618
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,659
Wind down this La Zonga crap
and make a newspaper.

619
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,327
Let me tell you some home truth.

620
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,622
This paper's been on its knees to a
bank since the day it opened.

621
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,833
And like most every other
newspaper on Earth,

622
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,334
it's financed by its advertising.

623
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,628
And without advertising,
not only is there no La Zonga,

624
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,588
there's no paper to put it in, so, thus,

625
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,174
there are one or two things
that we don't write about.

626
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,759
ln other words, nothing at all.

627
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,761
ln one other word, discretion.

628
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,680
You're not a foreign correspondent

629
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,017
in some far-flung
foreign land, this is America.

630
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,393
This is Puerto Rico.

631
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,854
This is America.

632
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,189
You think some plumber
from Normal, lllinois,

633
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,234
saves up for 25 years
to come here on a cruise ship

634
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,862
to read about bad times
in the sugar plantation?

635
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,864
They don't give a fuck!

636
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,532
The average guy don't rock the boat,

637
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,325
'cause he wants to climb aboard it.

638
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,078
And our readership is vividly average.

639
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,541
They don't care who the losers are.

640
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,419
They want to know who won.

641
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,712
Who won the bowls,

642
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,882
who won the races,
who won the pot at the slot machines.

643
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,261
Look at me, Kemp.

644
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,014
You're not sleeping, you're wide awake.

645
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,600
And this is the American Dream.

646
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,021
So many hotels, you can't see the sea.

647
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,106
You can see the sea
by checking into the hotels.

648
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,441
Pay to see the sea?

649
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,443
What's the matter with that?

650
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,320
You're paying to be in the dream.

651
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,573
There's a thin veneer, Kemp,

652
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,325
between the dream and the reality.

653
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,287
You wake them up and the people might
start asking for their money back.

654
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,253
You're the boss.

655
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,173
Not quite.

656
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,844
The editorial policy
of this newspaper is owned by the dream.

657
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,396
Oh, God.

658
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,529
Oh, Christ.

659
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,954
Oh, God, look at that.

660
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,166
Oh, God!

661
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,751
Hal?

662
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,837
No, no, l'm a friend of Hal's.

663
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,797
l was looking at his boat.

664
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,674
She's a sweet little beauty.

665
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,092
You been aboard?

666
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,343
No.

667
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,845
Great little island hopper.

668
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,763
We've all been down on her.

669
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,807
lt's a wonderful experience.

670
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,481
You two are early.

671
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,608
You got lucky.

672
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,817
Yeah.

673
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,110
Did you meet?

674
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,820
Yeah, we got first names.

675
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:15,908
Art Zimburger,
late of the U.S. Marines, great friend of mine.

676
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,535
This is Mr. Paul Kemp, New York Times.

677
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,870
You're the writer.

678
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,121
Paul's a novelist.

679
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,500
New York Times?

680
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,502
He don't know one from the other.

681
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,546
Just go with it. This guy's key.

682
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,964
Key to what?

683
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,842
Key to the discussion we're about to have.

684
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,181
Look at those mothers.

685
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,184
Come with me, Kemp.

686
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,021
This is a private beach.

687
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,314
We are not on it.

688
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,149
No, but we are!

689
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,151
And what we do is private!

690
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,238
Now get the fuck gone!

691
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,034
Get the fuck out of here!

692
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,577
l see your face again,

693
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,622
you're gonna have a 1 2-gauge shotgun
telling you what to do.

694
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,800
Talking about Satan...

695
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,178
lf there ever was
a kingdom of Satan, the Soviet Union is it.

696
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,516
The only way to come
to terms with Communism is to destroy it.

697
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:27,437
Hit it before it hits us
in a devastating democratic strike.

698
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,106
No more for the major.

699
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,693
They're looking for a man
to push that button,

700
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,444
l am that man.

701
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,530
Yes, you are, honey.

702
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,783
You look ravishing, Chenault.

703
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,118
Thank you.

704
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,244
You need rescuing?

705
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,745
Don't take him away.

706
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,455
He's very entertaining.

707
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,961
We were discussing Cuba and, l don't know,
we kind of veered off, didn't we?

708
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,422
Paul presents us
with a somewhat liberal point of view.

709
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,173
There is no such thing as a liberal.

710
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:58,719
A liberal is a Commie with a college
education thinking Negro thoughts.

711
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,138
Well, here's a fact for you.

712
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:05,726
76.4% of all Negroes
are controlled from Moscow.

713
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,729
That's why Castro gets such an easy ride.

714
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,690
ln my view, we ought to bomb
Cuba off the face of the Earth,

715
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,150
-let its people live in peace.
-Art.

716
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,485
Hey. Come on, let's eat.

717
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,945
Come on.

718
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,076
Who's the guy in the shades?

719
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,538
Segurra's Daddy. lt's who you're waiting for.

720
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,250
Thank you for my roses.

721
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,128
l didn't think you noticed.

722
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,088
Of course l noticed.

723
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,844
Paul, would you mind joining us?

724
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,185
How do you do, sir?

725
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,478
-Mr. Kemp.
-Nice to see you.

726
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,645
Mr. Kemp.

727
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,483
Okay.

728
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,402
Let me just start by saying
this is a purely informal meeting.

729
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,822
And, incidentally,
you don't worry about Lotterman, okay?

730
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,074
Lotterman?

731
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,451
What the hell's Lotterman
got to do with The New York Times?

732
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,536
Mr. Kemp subs for a variety of newspapers.

733
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,038
Occasionally, he writes for the news.

734
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,248
What he does in his spare time is his affair.

735
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,666
That's how l like it.

736
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,126
We'd like you to do some writing for us.

737
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,544
So l gather.

738
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,921
About what?

739
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,131
ln a sentence, we want to set something up,

740
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,425
and have the public as our friends.

741
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,761
And there are a variety
of ways we can do that.

742
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,266
Let me tell you
how this kind of thing works, Paul.

743
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:32,562
Suppose, by way of example,
you wanted to put up taxes by 5%.

744
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,022
The smart way of doing it

745
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,983
is to float the idea of a 10%¤ hike.

746
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,694
Let them all shout about it,
get themselves in a fuss,

747
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,029
then you offer concessions.

748
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,073
"How about 7%?" "No way," they'll say.

749
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:48,578
"All right, let's
stay friends and make a compromise at five."

750
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:49,663
Bingo.

751
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:53,333
They think they won something,
you get the 5% you wanted in the first place.

752
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,252
Same thing applies to real estate.

753
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,421
You want to build five houses,

754
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,798
you put in a planning application for 50.

755
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,925
How many do you want to build?

756
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,176
None.

757
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,220
We want to build one hotel.

758
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,805
Well, looking around this place,

759
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,432
l don't think anyone would notice.

760
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,308
lt isn't in this place.

761
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,601
lt's an island.

762
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,313
Sensitive for a variety
of reasons we don't want to get into now.

763
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,024
Nobody wants a paradise
choked with hotels, but

764
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,445
everybody will be pleased
to compromise at one.

765
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,613
This is going to require some clever writing

766
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,323
in various carefully placed articles.

767
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,326
lsn't that kind of thing illegal?

768
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,870
lf l may say, Mr. Kemp,

769
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,622
that's an inappropriate comment.

770
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,833
Where's the island?

771
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,959
Can't tell you.

772
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,127
Not yet.

773
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,796
Discretion is paramount, Mr. Kemp.

774
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,048
lf you want to join us,
you'll have to sign some papers.

775
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,135
We're having a meeting
tomorrow in Hal's office.

776
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,386
lf you want to be part of what will be

777
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,389
a very exciting project, come along.

778
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,225
There's a man outside
in a funny little car for Paul.

779
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,310
Oh, yeah.

780
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,728
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

781
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,313
l have to run.

782
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,570
Can't stay?

783
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,156
l hear the mermaids
come out in the moonlight.

784
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,624
From the moment we met, l knew

785
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,210
there was going to be something between us.

786
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,961
lt's called her fiancé.

787
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:23,465
God, l'm so hopelessly
and progressively in love.

788
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,842
Do not confuse love with lust,

789
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,053
nor drunkenness with judgment.

790
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,263
You want my advice?

791
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,973
No. lf it involves her, no, l don't.

792
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,433
Stay away from her.

793
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,851
And stay away from Sanderson.

794
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:36,144
You're way out of depth.

795
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:38,939
l got no brief for Sanderson
or his pissy rip-off island.

796
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,526
l just want some
apple blossom lipstick and fucks.

797
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,528
You are in total denial.

798
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,820
She's fucking someone else.

799
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,407
And as l understand it,
about to be married to him.

800
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,118
You won't even make an invite.

801
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,497
l don't believe this.

802
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,624
We're right back where we started.

803
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,502
That is the same Cabrones we passed

804
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,962
ten minutes ago.

805
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,764
We need directions.

806
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,976
Let's get in there and get something to eat.

807
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,438
No.

808
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,648
Please, no.

809
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,777
l haven't spent all day
on a beach munching lobster with criminals,

810
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,070
and l'm starving.

811
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:08,862
Two beers, two rums, one steak.

812
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,988
The kitchen is closed.

813
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,531
All right then, two beers and two rums.

814
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,408
And one steak.

815
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,909
Cerrado, Mister...

816
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,245
Yeah, but let's not bother me with that.

817
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:22,375
You got a sign down there saying, "Food til
midnight," and l want a steak.

818
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,715
Girl of the swamp.

819
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,718
Which reminds me, we need a map.

820
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,345
You know what l think?

821
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:36,014
l think we're drinking too much rum.

822
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,390
There's no other way.

823
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:42,646
l'm getting double ashtray
and double salt pot.

824
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,190
You got a Moburg bifocal.

825
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,567
Christ, this is heinous.

826
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,236
lmagine what it must be like
to be an alcoholic.

827
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:52,572
$2.

828
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,200
You pay and you go.

829
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:56,993
l don't see a steak.

830
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,912
No steak.

831
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,246
What do you mean, no steak?

832
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,666
l think he means no steak.

833
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,377
The kitchen is closed.

834
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,878
l got no way of serving you.

835
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:10,674
Listen, you don't want
to hear about my bad day,

836
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,218
and l don't want no grave side out of you.

837
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:16,096
lf you can't cook it, bring it like it is.
l'll eat it raw.

838
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,307
Two dollars, you pay and go.

839
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,809
Don't bother me.

840
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,436
You pay now, or l call the cops.

841
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,648
lf you have no intention of serving me steak,

842
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,109
why don't you do your best to fuck off.

843
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,128
lt seems to me there's a bad vibe developing.

844
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,464
There are one or two oddities
giving us the eye.

845
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,091
Don't get paranoid.

846
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,551
He's on the phone.

847
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:55,719
For what?

848
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,053
Ordering food in a restaurant?

849
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,305
Let's hope he's through to the FBl.

850
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,520
What's the matter?

851
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,188
What are you smiling at?

852
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,399
l'm not smiling.

853
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,609
l'm maintaining a casual face.

854
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,115
A man just walked in

855
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,744
and has good reason
for regarding us in a negative light.

856
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,328
-Us?
-Me.

857
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,247
And he's just seen me.

858
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,208
And he wants revenge on the white man.

859
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,128
The fuck are you talking about?

860
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,131
How about the one with the dent?

861
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,218
The one with the eye?

862
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,386
The very same.

863
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,514
Do we walk or run?

864
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,516
Walk.

865
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,642
l'll push the car.

866
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,195
Let's walk and hope he's happy.

867
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,669
Hey, Yankee.

868
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,171
Yankee!

869
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,360
Don't let me see headlights.

870
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,530
Please don't let me see headlights.

871
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,866
l just seen headlights.

872
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,118
Put your foot down.

873
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,745
Where exactly do you think l got it?

874
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:57,757
Can you go faster?

875
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,092
Going fast as l can.

876
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,030
Jesus Christ, man.

877
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,514
We're gonna be killed! We're gonna be killed!

878
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,354
Hey!

879
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,069
Get ready to run.

880
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,362
Run in opposite directions.

881
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,447
Give me the brew!

882
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:03,615
Give me the fucking brew!

883
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,385
Paul!

884
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,578
Piece of luck. l just saw Moburg.

885
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,664
At least l think he saw us.

886
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,543
They got some kind of night court going.

887
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,810
He says we were animals

888
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:17,105
on a rampage of drunken anarchy,

889
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,065
poured gasoline on one of his cops.

890
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,781
Oh, my God, we're doomed.

891
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:28,825
You have something to say?

892
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,578
Yes, Your Honor, l do.

893
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:37,667
Firstly, this guy
handcuffed to me, l never seen in my life.

894
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:42,296
And second,
we'd like a translation of the charges.

895
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:43,798
You heard what they said?

896
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,468
With respect,
l heard people speaking Spanish.

897
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:51,431
What kind of language do you think we
speak in this country, Mister?

898
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,105
He's not with us.

899
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,941
The cops attached him to get a conviction.

900
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,653
Did you leave
the Café Cabrones without paying?

901
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,700
Did you set fire
to the police officer, yes or no?

902
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,827
Unfortunately, Your Honor,
he got in the way of our flame.

903
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,328
That's right.

904
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:18,374
No way did we pour
gasoline on his head and laugh as we did.

905
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:19,876
lt wasn't like he said.

906
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,335
Like he said?

907
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:23,379
Like you say you don't speak Spanish.

908
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,506
Mr. Kemp doesn't speak Spanish.

909
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,550
Well, he will
have plenty of opportunity to learn.

910
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,635
The charges against you are grave.

911
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,181
Resisting arrest
carries a tariff alone of one year in prison.

912
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,516
Never mind assault with a deadly weapon.

913
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,561
l'm going to refer this case to a higher court.

914
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,898
Meanwhile,
l remand you both in custody for 30 days.

915
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,903
lf l may, Your Honor.

916
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:58,915
Go ahead, Mr. Sanderson.

917
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,500
Thank you, Your Honor.

918
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,794
lt isn't my purpose to interrupt proceedings,

919
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:06,589
but if the intention
is to remand these gentlemen,

920
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,966
l would respectfully ask for a brief recess

921
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,718
to allow me to contact their counsel.

922
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,512
Who is who?

923
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:13,763
Alfredo Quinones.

924
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,226
lt would necessitate
getting him out of bed, of course.

925
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,729
But given the importance
of these gentlemen to

926
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:24,023
various interests,

927
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,693
l'm sure that he would be as pleased as l

928
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,072
to come down here at 3:00 in the morning.

929
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,621
How much did we cost him?

930
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,706
About $1 ,000 apiece.

931
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:54,679
l can't thank you enough.

932
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,722
Don't be late.

933
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,210
Mother of balls!

934
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,630
We got to rescue the car.

935
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:31,841
Not now. We'll do it later.

936
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,134
l've got a meeting.

937
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,011
We do not have later.

938
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,555
They've already had it 1 2 hours.

939
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,266
l know how these bastards work.

940
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,020
They can strip a train to axles in 1 2 minutes.

941
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:47,440
We'll be lucky to find an oil spot.

942
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,279
How long is this gonna take?

943
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,530
How would l know?

944
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:55,698
l can't be late.

945
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,533
l don't know why you're going at all.

946
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,202
That guy is bad company.

947
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,037
He's a manipulative prick.

948
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,372
He manipulated us out ofjail, didn't he?

949
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,124
Now he fucking owns us.

950
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,461
l got a tongue like...

951
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,631
Like a towel.

952
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,216
Want a beer?

953
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,718
Do l want a beer?

954
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,679
No, l do not.

955
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,058
l am never gonna touch alcohol again.

956
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,614
What fresh hell is this?

957
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,449
Front seat's gone.

958
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,701
That's a write-off. lsn't it?

959
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,388
You know what, l've got a brilliant idea.

960
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,079
What's that?

961
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,290
There's too much weight on the axle.

962
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,417
Try and move forward a bit.

963
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,960
Gonna be late.

964
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,045
l'm gonna be a week late.

965
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,050
What are you doing, Sala?

966
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,095
l suddenly realize how much l like you.

967
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,680
What do you mean, what am l doing?

968
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,391
There's something wrong with the axle.

969
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,857
Oh, my God, it's the cop we set on fire.

970
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,030
Try and look normal.

971
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,789
Make a right! Make a right!

972
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,541
-What right? There is no right.
-Any right!

973
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,111
There he is. Paul, come in.

974
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,530
Sorry. There were unexpected developments.

975
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,616
l had to go home and start the day again.

976
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,994
Tell me about it.
Some days are two sizes too small.

977
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,871
Well, l'm afraid some of us had to leave.

978
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,873
But, Mr. Zimburger you know.

979
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:53,542
And this is Mr. Green
of First National Maritime Bank.

980
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:54,627
You want some coffee?

981
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,670
l think we should move right along, Hal.

982
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,047
-l gotta go.
-Sure.

983
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,632
Sit down, Paul.

984
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,176
As you may know, Mr. Kemp,

985
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,221
the island is owned by the U.S. government.

986
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,807
Part of it presently
used as a target range by the Navy.

987
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,184
We know from internal sources...

988
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,435
ls that what you're calling me?

989
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:16,399
...that the government
is preparing to relinquish the lease,

990
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,359
and this place wakes up as 32 square miles

991
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,028
of magnificent and untouched real estate.

992
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,531
Knock your eyes out.

993
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,783
No prettier beaches in the Caribbean.

994
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,703
Orientated around
one hell of a beautiful marina.

995
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:32,998
Thought it was one hotel.

996
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,583
We start with one hotel.

997
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,876
lt's a foot in the door.

998
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,337
Once we're up and running,
we're servants of a market.

999
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,840
-Like here?
-Like here.

1000
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,259
You look worried, Mr. Kemp.

1001
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,220
He's not worried.

1002
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,596
Paul and l shared a tricky little night.

1003
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,266
Right, Paul?

1004
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:51,892
Neither of us got much sleep.

1005
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,979
l gotta go, guys.

1006
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,022
Well, we'll leave you gentlemen to it.

1007
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,649
Has Mr. Kemp signed the papers?

1008
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,526
Doing that right now.

1009
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,529
What am l actually signing?

1010
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,031
Just a confidentiality
agreement, affirmation of trust.

1011
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,951
Just so we're all sitting in the same Jacuzzi.

1012
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,163
ln case a turd floats up,
if you know what l mean.

1013
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,002
Come on, Paul, let's go over here.

1014
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:23,966
Here you go.

1015
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,219
lt's just a technicality, Paul.

1016
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,931
Means you promise
not to talk to anybody about the project.

1017
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,475
How's the head?

1018
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,934
Unpleasant.

1019
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,395
Gotta thank you again for putting up the bail.

1020
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,856
lt's held on my cognizance.

1021
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,359
And l think it
more than likely to slip various minds.

1022
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:45,613
This place is a sea of money, Paul.

1023
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,615
Unbelievable money.

1024
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,410
Practically every
major corporation hides its cash offshore.

1025
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,828
No, thanks.

1026
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,414
And that is good news for us,

1027
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,250
because we are the shore.

1028
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,171
Not one dollar
that wings its way into Puerto Rico

1029
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,756
pays a cent in tax.

1030
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,758
-Nothing?
-Not penny one.

1031
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,051
That includes chemical companies,

1032
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,677
oil companies, mining companies.

1033
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,763
There's $1 2 billion worth of copper

1034
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,265
in mountains less than 20 miles from here.

1035
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,726
A dozen billion dollars.

1036
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,439
And there's people like me

1037
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,816
who know how to get it out.

1038
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,613
So, putting it into context,

1039
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,450
l don't envisage the breaking of
bones to get at a thousand bucks.

1040
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,828
Because you weren't here,

1041
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,331
l agreed to an itinerary
with Zimburger on your behalf.

1042
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,960
You'll be traveling down in the morning.
Hope that's okay.

1043
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,758
What do you need, Paul?

1044
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,303
Well, just in the context
of this Zimburger thing,

1045
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,473
do you think
there's a possibility of an advance?

1046
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,726
l don't like to ask,
but Lotterman's pretty erratic

1047
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,311
with the paycheck, you know.

1048
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,437
Need to get a hold of a car.

1049
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,855
You don't have a car?

1050
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,691
Nothing too reliable.

1051
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,151
Plus, sooner or later,
l'm gonna have to find a decent place to live.

1052
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,611
Well, we can help you with that.

1053
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:11,031
When you get back,
we'll sort you out something with a view.

1054
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,619
Carol, what do we have in the garage?

1055
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:18,831
No, no, no, no, no, no, not that.

1056
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,375
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, thank you.

1057
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,337
Got you a car.
She'll give you the keys on the way out.

1058
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,050
Feels like 500?

1059
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,679
Yeah. Thanks.

1060
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,473
Paul...

1061
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,601
How's your afternoon?

1062
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,269
A half-written horoscope.

1063
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,105
Do me a favor, will you?
Drive out to the beach and pick up Chenault.

1064
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,648
l need her downstairs by 6:00.

1065
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,066
All right.

1066
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,861
So, this one?

1067
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,572
Or...

1068
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,742
This one?

1069
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,827
What are these for, a party?

1070
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,579
lt's for carnival.

1071
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,915
Didn't he say anything to you about it?

1072
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,876
-No.
-You've got to come.

1073
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,462
We're all going down on the boat.

1074
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,090
He didn't invite me.

1075
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,217
Well, it isn't his carnival.

1076
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,427
This one.

1077
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,682
l like the other one.

1078
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:05,896
Yes.

1079
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,786
Love this car.

1080
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,123
Did he give it to you?

1081
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:25,791
l wish.

1082
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,085
Fast.

1083
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,839
You want a little bet?

1084
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,633
A bet about what?

1085
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,219
That you scream before l do.

1086
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,682
That l scream
before you do, in relation to what?

1087
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,768
Well, how fast does it go?

1088
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,312
l don't know.

1089
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,483
That's the bet.

1090
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,450
l already crashed one car today.

1091
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,498
lt's okay.
l'll just go sit in the foyer and wait for him.

1092
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,430
What do l get if l win?

1093
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,600
l'll let you know if you do.

1094
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,752
Come on, l'll take you back.

1095
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,474
Christ, where'd they get this?

1096
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:33,145
l don't remember.
l've been slightly avoiding Lotterman.

1097
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,689
You have me to thank for your freedom.

1098
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:36,982
Thanks.

1099
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,443
l got a feeling of total anxiety

1100
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:43,322
trying to put my anxieties
together in a single, coherent lump.

1101
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,741
l'm fucked without a car.

1102
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:46,992
l got us a car.

1103
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:49,244
lt's the Chevy downstairs.

1104
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:51,455
lt belongs to Mr. Sanderson.

1105
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:52,831
So what?

1106
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,042
l gotta go type this up.

1107
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,464
l don't know what's going on.

1108
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:02,966
He's freaking out and we're down 1 2 pages.

1109
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,553
You better frigging do it!

1110
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,597
l see your filthy animal face in here again,

1111
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,682
l'll have you locked up!

1112
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,101
What part of the building
are you creeping towards, Sala?

1113
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,770
-Darkroom.
-Cops are looking for you.

1114
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,146
-Looking for me?
-Looking for you.

1115
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,898
And it ain't just your mug in the paper!

1116
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:19,775
What a day.

1117
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,818
What a week.

1118
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,278
l tell you, l'm out of here.

1119
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,197
One way to friggin' Mexico.

1120
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:29,159
Listen, l got a trip tomorrow.
Sanderson's island.

1121
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,994
-No, no, no.
-Oh, dear.

1122
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:33,956
lt's green money, and l'm thinking of
cutting across for the carnival.

1123
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,457
You know they
got that carnival in Saint Thomas.

1124
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,792
l know.

1125
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,002
Why don't you come with me?

1126
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:41,296
Give the cops a few days to forget.

1127
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,507
Yeah. Fun.

1128
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,710
Our guys. 1 2-inch Naval, 14 miles out.

1129
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,962
Nobody lives here?

1130
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:23,755
No one who's staying.

1131
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,133
Lazar!

1132
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:27,551
Mr. Zimburger.

1133
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:34,224
This is Mr. Lazar,
our much put-upon site architect.

1134
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,517
-How do you do.
-Hello.

1135
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,685
Mr. Monk, l think you know.

1136
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,603
l assist Mr. Green, First Maritime Bank.

1137
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,647
This is Mr. Kemp from The New York Times.

1138
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:41,773
What did you say your name was?

1139
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,650
-Bob Sala.
-Yeah, Sala.

1140
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,445
From American Travel Writers Association.

1141
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,324
Mr. Kemp is preparing our brochure.

1142
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:53,869
"Wish you were here."

1143
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,079
Beer in the cooler, gentlemen.

1144
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:58,290
l have everything next door.

1145
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,794
This and this are the main hotels.

1146
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:04,713
22 floors.

1147
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,299
Guardians of the bay, so to speak.

1148
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,259
Why the different colors?

1149
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,971
Blue is for public
dissemination, red is for the investors.

1150
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:16,808
Yeah. Hill villas, ocean condos.

1151
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,187
Marina.

1152
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:23,315
Parking for 2,000 cars.

1153
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:24,775
There's no roads.

1154
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:27,819
Damn it, Lazar, you forgot the roads!

1155
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,324
We're building them. We're building them.

1156
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,202
Let's have some lunch.

1157
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:55,847
1 0,000 waiters, maids,
bellhops, janitors, clerks.

1158
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,144
Plus, whores for the fat man.

1159
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,438
Hard to believe they'd do it.

1160
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,990
l was talking to that architect kind of guy.

1161
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,119
He's going
to Saint Thomas, if you want a ride.

1162
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:18,328
When?

1163
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:19,955
How do l know when?

1164
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,998
When he's finished here.

1165
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:24,876
You know what Oscar Wilde said?

1166
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,588
"They know the price of everything,

1167
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,299
"the value of nothing."

1168
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,736
Two rums.

1169
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,239
l thought you'd given up.

1170
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:56,575
Finally beat my willpower.

1171
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,163
Come on, let's go here.

1172
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:17,095
Hey, mi amigo!

1173
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:21,266
Hey, Rosie's a singer.

1174
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,142
Paul!

1175
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,563
Where's Hal?

1176
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:10,273
-Boat.
-Boat?

1177
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:12,359
Help me find my girlfriend.

1178
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,157
Hey! How are you?

1179
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:21,952
Watch your step.

1180
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,203
-Thank you.
-All right.

1181
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,287
-There we go.
-Thank you.

1182
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,413
Hi.

1183
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:26,915
Look at you.

1184
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,709
Good. Grab some champagne.

1185
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,211
Hey, Captain.

1186
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:32,796
-Hey.
-Hey.

1187
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:37,968
Did you take Sala to the island?

1188
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,099
You shouldn't have done that, Paul.

1189
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,059
lt's why we have a confidentiality agreement.

1190
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,686
He isn't interested.

1191
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,896
He's got a mouth like an AP wire.

1192
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,527
l just don't know what he was doing there.

1193
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,780
And l sure as shit don't
know what he's doing here.

1194
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,021
Not going glum on us, are you?

1195
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,065
Just thoughts.

1196
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:36,901
What's the book?

1197
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,279
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

1198
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,782
lt was written in 1 797
by a junkie called Coleridge.

1199
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,537
He wrote that when he was 25 years old.

1200
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:52,584
l've been dragging
a typewriter around with me for 1 0.

1201
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,169
l've written nothing.

1202
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,129
You've written some books.

1203
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,380
Nah.

1204
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,549
They had no voice.

1205
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:05,180
l don't know how to write like me.

1206
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,603
l resent that.

1207
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:13,646
No, l really have to say he's all right.

1208
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:14,981
l have to admit.

1209
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:16,900
Fair is fair. Fair is fair.

1210
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,068
Thank you for the afternoon.

1211
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:19,611
Maybe we'll see you in town.

1212
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:20,779
Where you going?

1213
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,989
Her friend's playing in a band.

1214
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:24,324
We're gonna go check it out.

1215
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,533
We want to come.

1216
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,494
l'll rephrase that.

1217
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:28,828
We don't want to come.

1218
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:30,705
Yes, we do. Us girls want to dance.

1219
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:32,707
You're dancing tomorrow.

1220
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,585
What's the point of going to carnival
if everything is preplanned?

1221
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,879
l want to dance,
and if you're not going to take me,

1222
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,714
-l'm gonna go with them.
-She's got you trumped, Hal.

1223
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:41,007
Sit down. You're drunk.

1224
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,468
So what? So is everyone else.

1225
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,803
Come on.

1226
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:47,305
Come on, let's do it. lt might be amusing.

1227
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:57,482
Oh, cuidado. Careful.

1228
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,484
Here we go.

1229
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,553
Yeah.

1230
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,443
We're done. We're spent.

1231
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:42,735
-You're gonna go?
-Yes, we're gonna leave.

1232
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:43,820
You're done?

1233
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,280
l can't dance no more. Really.

1234
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:48,199
Hold on. You know what? l'll be out.
Let me just get Chenault.

1235
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,039
You want rum or beer?

1236
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,291
Both.

1237
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:59,711
Dos rum, dos cervezas.

1238
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:00,962
-Whoa, whoa.
-We're gonna go.

1239
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,630
-Hey.
-We're gonna go.

1240
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,799
-What?
-Natalie's leaving,

1241
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:06,176
-so let's go.
-Hey, hey.

1242
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,178
-Come on, come on.
-No, no, no, no.

1243
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,724
Chenault, come here. We're leaving.

1244
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:16,436
-Chenault.
-Stop it!

1245
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,062
Chenault!

1246
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:00,665
Chenault, come here! Chenault!

1247
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:04,002
Get your hands off me, you motherfucker!

1248
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,801
You want to fuck with me?

1249
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:14,721
You know who l am?

1250
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,222
You motherfucker!

1251
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,182
You know who l am?

1252
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,479
-You're a dead man!
-Go! Go!

1253
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:24,856
Get your hands off me.

1254
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,357
-You're a dead man!
-Go!

1255
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,067
Forget it.

1256
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:31,696
-We'll call you a cab.
-Fuck off!

1257
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,785
l gotta get the girl.

1258
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:40,371
She's having a good time. We closed.

1259
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,626
You deaf?

1260
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,377
l said we closed.

1261
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:47,962
No way, Paul.

1262
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:49,672
No way.

1263
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,664
l looked everywhere.

1264
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,249
l went to the gendarme.

1265
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,168
And?

1266
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:29,837
We went up there.

1267
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,756
Nothing. Nobody there.

1268
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,968
But an old woman with a mop.

1269
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,765
She was more help than the cops were.

1270
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,352
"What can l do if your girlfriend
likes someone else?" he said.

1271
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,271
He's right about that, Paul.

1272
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,900
She's not your girlfriend.

1273
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:04,956
Maybe she went back to the boat.

1274
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:11,295
Did you try the boat?

1275
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,964
No.

1276
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,718
l don't think he'd let her back on.

1277
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:37,113
ls she with you?

1278
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,992
Why don't you mind
your own goddamn business?

1279
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,495
l want the keys.

1280
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:46,789
The Chevy.

1281
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,018
You blew it, Kemp.

1282
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:33,544
lt's all rust.

1283
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:40,593
l've seen better tires
hanging over the side of a tug.

1284
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,929
You want it or not?

1285
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,725
Yeah, we want it.

1286
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:52,104
Everyone turns up
for their Friday check, right?

1287
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,398
No check, no Lotterman.

1288
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:58,736
So l go around to see
that unforgivably ugly wife of his.

1289
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,113
She tells me he's gone to Miami.

1290
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:02,448
For what?

1291
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:04,659
You don't know, l don't know.

1292
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,286
But the scabs are back.

1293
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:11,916
Since Morell went,
the paper took a turn for the worse.

1294
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:15,837
ls there anything in the spinner?

1295
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,588
We need a fresh sack.

1296
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,384
Well, maybe l can
interest you gentlemen in something else.

1297
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,261
Like what, death?

1298
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:27,014
Like the most powerful drug
in the history of narcotics.

1299
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,811
l'm not at liberty to discuss or disclose.

1300
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:35,022
All l can tell you is this stuff is so powerful,

1301
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:37,191
they give it to Communists.

1302
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:38,860
Who does?

1303
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,528
The FBl.

1304
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,531
Why would the FBl get Communists high?

1305
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,450
That l can't help you with.

1306
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,204
You take it like eye drops.

1307
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,041
ln the eye?

1308
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:55,751
So l understand.

1309
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,546
lt makes the eye see things.

1310
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,256
You see a different reality.

1311
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,508
What do you want for it?

1312
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:05,803
l'll throw it in
with the bike if you do me a favor.

1313
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,805
What's the favor?

1314
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,518
l want you to come to the bathroom with me.

1315
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:15,938
He's your man.

1316
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,982
-$50, right?
-Yeah.

1317
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,291
He wants me to look at his dick.

1318
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,001
l flatly refused.

1319
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,003
What does he want you to look at it for?

1320
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,421
Says there's something wrong with it.

1321
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,672
lt's a gentleman's matter.

1322
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:42,924
l'm not looking at it!

1323
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,300
All right, give me the drugs back.

1324
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,676
No! Wait.

1325
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:47,929
l'll look at it.

1326
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:55,019
l'll view it in the mirror.

1327
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,665
ls it clap?

1328
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,710
A standing ovation.

1329
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:49,991
You see anything?

1330
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:51,492
No.

1331
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,830
Neither do l.

1332
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:17,018
We'll give it another five minutes.

1333
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:19,895
Trouble making ends meet?

1334
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:22,273
-Then, you need the Lending Man.
-Right.

1335
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,323
Call the Lending Man now.

1336
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,346
How long since we took it?

1337
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,477
l don't know.

1338
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:02,938
A while.

1339
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:12,656
Bullshit, isn't it?

1340
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,826
ls it bullshit?

1341
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:43,664
Jesus.

1342
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,668
Your tongue is like an accusatory giblet.

1343
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,302
For Christ's sake, keep it out.

1344
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:57,553
What are you talking about?

1345
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,180
Your tongue belongs to Satan!

1346
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,472
Are you out of your mind?

1347
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,141
Keep it out!

1348
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,352
lf it goes back into your mouth, it'll kill you.

1349
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:08,564
We've got to get it into the sink!

1350
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:12,193
You're giving me fear.

1351
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,694
Stop it! l've got fear!

1352
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,321
Fuck you. So do l.

1353
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:16,614
You're high, you fool.

1354
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:17,990
Drink some rum.

1355
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,348
l thought l was losing grip in there.

1356
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:45,726
What did we take?

1357
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,311
l don't know.

1358
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:51,690
We need to get some more.

1359
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,120
That explains it.

1360
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,333
Doesn't it?

1361
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,293
Explains what?

1362
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,381
The world.

1363
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,176
And us.

1364
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:29,478
l wonder what it is
you might think about our different worlds.

1365
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:34,483
He looked at me kind of sideways and said,

1366
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:38,529
"Human beings
are the only creatures on Earth

1367
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,115
"that claim a God.

1368
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:46,287
"And the only living thing
that behaves like it hasn't got one.

1369
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:51,000
"Does the world belong to no one but you?"

1370
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:56,046
And when he said it, l was taken aback.

1371
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,843
Not because of who was doing the talking,

1372
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:03,804
because l finally understood the connection

1373
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:06,390
between children scavenging for food

1374
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:10,686
and shiny brass plates
on the front doors of banks.

1375
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,939
Gotta go.

1376
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:45,679
Come in.

1377
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:51,602
We gotta go.

1378
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:53,979
Give me a minute.

1379
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,777
l'll be waiting for you downstairs.

1380
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:14,208
How nice of you to drop in.

1381
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,709
l was covering the carnival.

1382
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,127
That's not what l heard.

1383
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,380
l heard you were
in the moonlight for Sanderson.

1384
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:20,506
l was what?

1385
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,965
Moonlighting for Sanderson.

1386
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,050
Where's Segurra?

1387
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,468
Mr. Segurra's no longer with us.

1388
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,552
l got a story for you.

1389
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:28,389
Yeah, you may have noticed
that l'm somewhat busy.

1390
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:32,309
This is real important,
involving Mr. Segurra and Mr. Hal Sanderson.

1391
01:35:32,394 --> 01:35:33,894
l'm gonna tell you how important it isn't.

1392
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:36,814
l got 21 jobs on the line
and a newspaper going under.

1393
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,399
Print this, and you'll sell it.

1394
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:39,900
A planning scam.

1395
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:42,027
Literally despoliation of a paradise.

1396
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:44,363
A thousand people
will be swept into the sea like garbage.

1397
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:45,906
You are weird, Kemp.

1398
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,200
lt's not what it's doing
to them, it's what it's doing to you.

1399
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:49,743
lt's called journalism.

1400
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:51,203
Make me laugh.

1401
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:53,080
l asked you to tidy up the booze,

1402
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:54,790
you couldn't even sweep out a room.

1403
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,125
Why do you think you're working here?

1404
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:59,336
'Cause you're everything
that's wrong with a journalist.

1405
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:01,839
And you're everything
that's wrong with this insult of a newspaper.

1406
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,674
Unanimously agreed.

1407
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,843
Why don't you shut it, Moburg?

1408
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:08,679
You are a waste of human sperm.

1409
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:14,810
Die a prolonged and
relentlessly agonizing death!

1410
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,368
Enjoy her.

1411
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:58,604
Made you some tea.

1412
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,571
You should try and sleep.

1413
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:09,698
l stole your bed.

1414
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:12,159
lt's okay.

1415
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,328
l'm going to write.

1416
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:20,959
l'm so sorry.

1417
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:24,087
Don't be sorry.

1418
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:30,093
You did me the best favor l ever had.

1419
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,267
There is no dream, Chenault.

1420
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,522
Just a piss puddle of greed,

1421
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:45,067
spreading throughout the world.

1422
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:53,325
l want to make a promise to you, the reader.

1423
01:37:54,244 --> 01:37:56,828
And l don't know if l can fulfill it tomorrow

1424
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:58,997
or even the day after that.

1425
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:02,668
But l put the bastards of this world on notice.

1426
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,089
That l do not have their
best interests at heart.

1427
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,301
l will try and speak for my reader.

1428
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:13,971
That is my promise.

1429
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:19,101
And it will be a voice made of ink and rage.

1430
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:24,064
Sit down. l made you coffee.

1431
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:25,482
Thanks.

1432
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,445
One for you and one for me.

1433
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,994
Oh, man, l would
rather not start the day with this.

1434
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:39,538
-What is it?
-lt's a writ.

1435
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:41,123
Means we're going to court.

1436
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,625
lt means
they can arrest us, should they so desire,

1437
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,586
any damn minute they please.

1438
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:47,254
We need to speak to a lawyer.

1439
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,131
We don't even have a phone.

1440
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:50,841
l know an old guy, Spanish Advocate.

1441
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,426
Kind of owes me one.

1442
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:53,969
You should get dressed. We'll go down there.

1443
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,513
Water ran out. l'm covered in soap.

1444
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:58,515
Fuck it. See what l can do.

1445
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:02,102
What's it for?

1446
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,230
lt's Hal.

1447
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,319
He put up a bond for us
on this thing, and now he's pulled it.

1448
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:11,528
Here.

1449
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,536
You know he's a crook, Paul.

1450
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,331
And we get the writs.

1451
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,470
What is it?

1452
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:03,223
lt's Hitler.

1453
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:13,859
lt's over.

1454
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:15,152
What is?

1455
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,238
They shut us down.

1456
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,616
He just stood there and lied to us.

1457
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:24,411
He hasn't got the morality
of a clapped out cash register.

1458
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:28,081
l hate to tell you this, guys,
but it was to avoid severance.

1459
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:29,916
We all know what it was for, Charlie.

1460
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,752
-What are we gonna do?
-Nothing.

1461
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:34,796
There's nothing we can do,
except report him to the labor board,

1462
01:41:34,881 --> 01:41:36,548
which is the same thing as doing nothing.

1463
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,008
l disagree.

1464
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:39,885
We gotta strike back

1465
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:42,679
and nail this bastard to his own front door.

1466
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:44,431
And how, pray, do we do that?

1467
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,391
By printing the paper.

1468
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:48,977
We got tons of stuff on Lotterman.

1469
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:52,022
Every happy maggot with his hand in the till.

1470
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,610
lt may be the last-ever issue,
but we go out in a blaze of rage.

1471
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:59,821
What are you talking about?
lt costs $2,200 a shot.

1472
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:01,072
We bring in the scabs.

1473
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,282
They're picketing for money.

1474
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:03,909
You're through the looking glass.

1475
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:06,536
We haven't even
got enough money for drinks.

1476
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,041
lt's not worth the fight. This has been
coming down the pike for a long time.

1477
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,626
You got to know it's over when it's over.

1478
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:16,505
This lousy little Caribbean rag is nothing
but a wrapping for fish heads.

1479
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:17,631
Plus, it's a lockout.

1480
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:19,216
Fuck the locks.

1481
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:21,968
l say we just walk in.

1482
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,056
Anybody with me?

1483
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:30,310
Bob?

1484
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,563
You know l'm with you.

1485
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,237
We didn't pay the bill.

1486
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:45,909
Where's Chenault?

1487
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,216
She's gone to New York.

1488
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,261
She left me $1 00.

1489
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:06,763
l don't believe it.

1490
01:43:07,557 --> 01:43:09,307
She didn't have any money.

1491
01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:11,309
You should use it to go with her.

1492
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:13,103
Red-eye for 50 bucks.

1493
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:14,271
No.

1494
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:17,107
l'm not going anywhere.

1495
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:21,653
By some means or
another, l'm gonna put the paper out.

1496
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:23,697
Print the bastard, then we're gone.

1497
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:25,699
Face the reality, Paul.

1498
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,993
There's no job, no money, no girl,

1499
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:29,870
and a warrant out for our arrest.

1500
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:31,162
There's no contest.

1501
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:33,039
Donovan's right, it ain't worth the fight.

1502
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:34,374
l'm not Donovan!

1503
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:36,793
And l'm not like the others.

1504
01:43:37,295 --> 01:43:39,504
l'm telling you right now,
next time some greasy moron

1505
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:42,465
starts bullshitting me, l'm going after him.

1506
01:43:44,302 --> 01:43:46,803
All the way up
to the president of the United States.

1507
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:49,806
l just want to win one once.

1508
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:51,808
One sheet.

1509
01:43:51,893 --> 01:43:54,185
You ain't gonna get far on $1 00.

1510
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:57,022
Some of the scabs will do it for nothing.

1511
01:43:57,106 --> 01:43:59,900
We're gonna need 20 guys, plus vans.

1512
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:02,402
No, no, all you need is two grand.

1513
01:44:04,614 --> 01:44:06,239
We're out of rum.

1514
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:13,163
lt's as if God, in a fit of disgust,

1515
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:15,832
has decided to wipe us all out.

1516
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:26,176
Yea, the cock crows thrice.

1517
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:34,184
What about El Monstruo?

1518
01:44:36,812 --> 01:44:38,897
Bet the $1 00 on El Monstruo.

1519
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:01,544
How do you know he lives here?

1520
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:03,129
l saw him come out.

1521
01:45:03,214 --> 01:45:05,715
You better let me do this on my own.

1522
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:12,639
lf he gets it, we should bring it to Papa Nebo.

1523
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:14,182
Who's that?

1524
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:15,725
My witch doctor.

1525
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:18,061
She's a hermaphrodite.

1526
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:22,607
Stop here! Stop here!

1527
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,279
By day, she drives a garbage truck.

1528
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:32,367
By night, she becomes Papa Nebo,

1529
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:36,079
the hermaphroditic oracle of the dead.

1530
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:40,458
When permission
is granted from Papa Samedi,

1531
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,545
the keeper of the cemetery,

1532
01:45:43,713 --> 01:45:45,171
she'll visit,

1533
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:47,382
and she'll dig up a corpse.

1534
01:45:48,009 --> 01:45:50,927
Certain organs of the disgrounded stiffs

1535
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:55,682
are indispensable for use in ouangas.

1536
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:18,496
This is horseshit, isn't it?

1537
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:20,290
She cured my prick.

1538
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,597
She wants to know what you want.

1539
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:40,769
We want her to empower this fowl.

1540
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:43,396
We want it blessed

1541
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:47,776
and anything that tries to fight it, dead.

1542
01:46:52,615 --> 01:46:54,407
Bring forth the fowl.

1543
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:42,205
She says that no fowl on Earth

1544
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:45,041
could challenge this cockerel and survive.

1545
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:46,251
Great.

1546
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:47,377
How's she off for curses?

1547
01:47:48,504 --> 01:47:50,255
Pretty good.

1548
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:53,675
Let's have a curse on Sanderson.
Make his dick fall off.

1549
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:55,176
And that fucker at the bank, Green.

1550
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:56,845
Mr. Green.

1551
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:12,402
Jesus!

1552
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:13,778
Curse active!

1553
01:48:32,923 --> 01:48:34,132
Okay, come on.

1554
01:49:09,585 --> 01:49:10,668
One down, two to go.

1555
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:12,212
Okay. l'm gonna call Moburg.

1556
01:49:12,296 --> 01:49:13,421
Okay.

1557
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:23,765
Come on. Come on.

1558
01:49:37,154 --> 01:49:38,696
He isn't there.

1559
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:42,992
He has to be.

1560
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:46,371
He isn't there.

1561
01:50:06,725 --> 01:50:08,059
-Where have you been?
-Sorry.

1562
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:09,894
l never heard the phone.

1563
01:50:09,979 --> 01:50:11,020
How's it going?

1564
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:13,481
Winning, man. We're winning.

1565
01:50:13,565 --> 01:50:16,109
ls everyone there? ls everyone there?

1566
01:50:17,361 --> 01:50:19,195
Yeah, everyone's here.

1567
01:50:19,321 --> 01:50:20,989
What about the vans?

1568
01:50:21,949 --> 01:50:23,449
What about the vans, Moburg?

1569
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:26,077
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, vans.

1570
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:30,581
You hear that?

1571
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:32,292
We're on our way.

1572
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:55,398
What the hell is going on?

1573
01:50:57,192 --> 01:50:59,068
He said he had the men.

1574
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,450
"All claims against
the former owners will be..."

1575
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:10,163
"Signed on behalf
of First Maritime Bank, Miami."

1576
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:12,373
Sanderson's pal, Mr. Green.

1577
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,587
Sorry, Paul.

1578
01:51:18,964 --> 01:51:20,298
l didn't know how to say.

1579
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:26,012
They took all the machines out.

1580
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:30,391
Not everything,
but just the parts that matter.

1581
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:35,271
l'll let you in.

1582
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:11,474
All l wanted was a front page.

1583
01:52:12,309 --> 01:52:14,268
Probably for the best.

1584
01:52:14,353 --> 01:52:16,979
Probably would've never pulled it off.

1585
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:22,944
How much did you guys win?

1586
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:24,904
Just under six grand.

1587
01:52:25,614 --> 01:52:27,490
Oh, yeah, well, you...

1588
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:29,617
At least you can pay off the bond now.

1589
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:31,244
Screw the bond.

1590
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:34,288
We're out of here.

1591
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:37,208
lt's over with.

1592
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,085
There's a midnight Pan Am.

1593
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:41,295
l'm not risking the airport.

1594
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:45,258
No.

1595
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:49,595
