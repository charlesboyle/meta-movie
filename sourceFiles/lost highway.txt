1
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:01,526
Dick Laurent is dead.

2
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:53,333
You don't mind that
I'm not coming to the club tonight?

3
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,060
What are you going to do?

4
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,066
Stay home, read.

5
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:06,654
Read?

6
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,708
Read?

7
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,129
Read what, Renee?

8
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,363
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.

9
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,102
I like to laugh, Fred.

10
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,695
That's why I married you.

11
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,530
You can wake me up when
you get home if you want to.

12
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,519
What is that?

13
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,237
A videotape.

14
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:47,675
I found it outside on the steps.

15
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:53,497
Who's it from?

16
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,334
I don't know.

17
00:10:57,712 --> 00:11:00,672
There isn't anything on the envelope.

18
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:06,275
Does it say anything on the tape?

19
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
No. Nothing.

20
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,734
Well, see what's on it.

21
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,460
Come on.

22
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:18,755
Must be from a real estate agent.

23
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,841
Maybe.

24
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
It's OK.

25
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,899
It's OK.

26
00:15:57,777 --> 00:15:59,777
It's OK.

27
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:52,417
I had a dream last night.

28
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:59,329
You were inside the house...

29
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,177
You were calling my name...

30
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,566
Fred.

31
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:23,072
Fred.

32
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,284
Where are you.

33
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,750
I couldn't find you.

34
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,230
Then there you were...

35
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,108
...Iying in bed.

36
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
It wasn't you.

37
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:04,201
It looked like you, but it wasn't.

38
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,145
Fred, are you all right?

39
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,176
You're up early.

40
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:42,344
That dog woke me.

41
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:55,860
Who the hell owns that dog?

42
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:09,071
What's that?

43
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:15,498
Another videotape.

44
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:18,499
Yes.

45
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:33,048
Don't you want to watch it?

46
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:36,517
I guess so.

47
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,426
Well, don't you want to watch it?

48
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,622
Yeah.

49
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:10,678
It's the same thing.

50
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:18,144
No, it isn't.

51
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,197
Fred?

52
00:21:41,337 --> 00:21:43,337
What?

53
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:57,196
We have to call the police.

54
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:00,155
That's right. Yes.

55
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:10,834
Someone broke in and taped us
while we slept. Isn't that enough?

56
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:15,547
7035 Hollis.

57
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:19,594
Near the observatory.

58
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,387
Yes.

59
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:26,098
We'll be here.

60
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,523
So?

61
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:35,874
They're sending 2 detectives out.

62
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:53,795
That's it.

63
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:55,782
What do you think.

64
00:22:55,882 --> 00:22:58,093
I really don't know.

65
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:10,636
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.

66
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,547
This is the bedroom?

67
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,620
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.

68
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,140
This is our bedroom.

69
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:50,228
There's no other bedroom?

70
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
No.

71
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:59,782
I mean, I use it as a practice room.

72
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,393
It's soundproof.

73
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:04,493
You're a musician?

74
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,607
Yeah.

75
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:08,400
What's your axe?

76
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,044
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.

77
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,424
Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.

78
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:18,661
Do you own a video camera?

79
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,761
No.

80
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Fred hates them.

81
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:33,442
I like to remember things my own way.

82
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:36,735
What do you mean by that?

83
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:44,201
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.

84
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,916
You have an alarm system?

85
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,588
Yes. Actually, we do.

86
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:56,094
But we haven't been using it lately.

87
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:59,176
Why not?

88
00:25:01,222 --> 00:25:03,432
It kept going off...

89
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:08,145
For some reason. False alarms.

90
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:12,739
Might want to try and use it again.

91
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,775
Yeah.

92
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:18,947
OK?

93
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:25,008
We're going to check
the windows and doors,

94
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,748
see if anybody tried to break in.

95
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:43,753
We'll keep watch over the house.
- We'll do the best we can.

96
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:48,952
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
- We will.

97
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:53,423
Thanks, guys.
- It's what we do.

98
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:32,255
Hey, Andy. Welcome to my party.

99
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:35,653
You look ravishing.
- Thank you.

100
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:52,316
Fred.

101
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:55,068
Please.

102
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:58,197
Please.

103
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,658
Hey.

104
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:19,989
2 double scotches, neat.
- OK.

105
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:14,171
We've met before, haven't we?

106
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,716
I don't think so.

107
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,682
Where was it you think we met?

108
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:28,861
At your house. Don't you remember?

109
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:34,022
No. No, I don't.

110
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:37,276
Are you sure?

111
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,528
Of course.

112
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:44,870
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.

113
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:53,295
What do you mean?
You're where right now?

114
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:57,633
At your house.

115
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:03,723
That's fucking crazy, man.

116
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:14,273
Call me.

117
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,448
Dial your number.

118
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:28,205
Go ahead.

119
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:42,471
I told you I was here.

120
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,933
How'd you do that?

121
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:53,105
Ask me.

122
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:00,766
How'd you get inside my house?

123
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:06,706
You invited me. It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.

124
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,832
Who are you?

125
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:12,084
Hm.

126
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,968
Give me back my phone.

127
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:33,318
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

128
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,323
I thought you were getting me a drink.
- Hang on just a minute.

129
00:31:55,423 --> 00:32:00,220
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?

130
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:06,476
I don't know his name. He's
a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

131
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,854
Dick Laurent?

132
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:14,693
Yeah. I believe so.

133
00:32:20,991 --> 00:32:23,791
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

134
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:27,747
He is?

135
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:32,899
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

136
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
I don't.

137
00:32:38,635 --> 00:32:40,635
I don't know him.

138
00:32:41,012 --> 00:32:43,012
Dick can't be dead.

139
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,767
Who told you he was dead?

140
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:49,856
Who, honey?
Who's dead?

141
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:54,177
Let's go home.

142
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:56,757
But...
- Now. We're leaving now.

143
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:03,907
We never should have come
here in the first place.

144
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:12,854
So, how'd you meet that
asshole Andy anyway?

145
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:18,258
It was a long time ago.

146
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,280
We met at a place called Moke's.

147
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:26,766
We became friends.

148
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:29,729
He told me about a job.

149
00:33:30,397 --> 00:33:32,397
What job?

150
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:36,777
I don't remember.

151
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,576
Anyway...Andy's OK.

152
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:49,013
Well, He's got some
pretty fucked-up friends.

153
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,759
Hey...
Hey...

154
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,805
Stay in the car.

155
00:35:31,024 --> 00:35:33,093
I told you to stay in the car.

156
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:36,530
Why? What is it?

157
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:40,117
Why did you make me stay out here?

158
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:48,025
I'll tell you why, because I thought
someone was inside the house.

159
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:51,797
Was there?

160
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:55,756
No, of course not.

161
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:43,066
Fred?

162
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:52,411
Fred, where are you?

163
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Renee.

164
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,123
Renee.

165
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,268
Sit down, Killer.

166
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:00,939
I didn't kill her.

167
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:05,988
Tell me I didn't kill her.

168
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:24,656
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

169
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,970
Fred Madison, the jury having found
you guilty of murder in the first degree,

170
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:40,030
it is my order that you be put
to death in the electric chair.

171
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,550
Make yourself to home, fella.

172
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:06,885
Stick your hand out, chief.

173
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Something wrong?

174
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:29,834
It's...my head.

175
00:45:55,571 --> 00:45:57,571
You sleeping OK?

176
00:45:57,907 --> 00:45:59,907
No.

177
00:46:00,452 --> 00:46:02,579
I can't sleep.

178
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:54,214
You'll sleep now.

179
00:46:55,468 --> 00:46:57,762
Take him back to his cell.

180
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,430
Let's go.

181
00:47:12,735 --> 00:47:14,735
Guard.

182
00:47:17,865 --> 00:47:19,865
Guard.

183
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:33,338
Guard.

184
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:40,012
Hey.

185
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:44,266
What do you want?

186
00:47:45,186 --> 00:47:48,106
Aspirin.
My head.

187
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:52,775
Hey. Hey.

188
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,629
Shit. That wife killer's
looking pretty fucked up.

189
00:48:10,296 --> 00:48:12,296
Which one?

190
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:00,951
Pete.

191
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:03,121
Please don't go.

192
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:05,816
No. Pete.

193
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:08,556
Pete...Pete...Pete.
Wait a minute.

194
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,681
Fuck me.

195
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,052
All right. What's the situation?

196
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:55,432
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

197
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:11,338
Right here.

198
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:17,845
That's not Fred Madison.

199
00:52:19,891 --> 00:52:21,891
No, Sir. It's not.

200
00:52:26,105 --> 00:52:28,858
Who is it?
- I couldn't say, Sir.

201
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:33,028
Captain Luneau?

202
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,030
Yeah, Mike?

203
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:36,559
Captain...

204
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:39,619
This is some spooky shit we got here.

205
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:52,438
Well, Gentlemen, we know
who the stranger is.

206
00:52:53,426 --> 00:52:57,106
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.

207
00:52:57,263 --> 00:53:00,600
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft...

208
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:05,069
...for which he was put
on probation for 1 year.

209
00:53:05,105 --> 00:53:12,071
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.

210
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:06,125
So...

211
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:48,838
Here.
- Thanks, Lou.

212
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:43,510
Where the fuck have you been, man?

213
00:56:44,085 --> 00:56:46,245
Hey. -Hiya. -Hi.
- Hey, guy.

214
00:56:46,963 --> 00:56:49,507
Hey, man.
- What's up man?

215
00:56:50,257 --> 00:56:52,802
Well, you look like shit.

216
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,010
Yeah. What happened?

217
00:56:56,263 --> 00:56:58,332
Just haven't been feeling so good.

218
00:56:58,432 --> 00:57:00,502
You're not contagious, are you?

219
00:57:00,602 --> 00:57:02,295
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.

220
00:57:02,395 --> 00:57:04,463
All right. Well, let's go for a drive then.

221
00:57:04,563 --> 00:57:07,843
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.

222
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:10,971
It takes many strawberries to fill a bucket.

223
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:14,191
But it's worth it when you know that...

224
00:57:14,284 --> 00:57:16,018
Come on.
- Hoh.

225
00:57:16,118 --> 00:57:17,686
Come on. I'll lead.

226
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:22,426
...and a glass of fresh, cold
milk from grandmother's cow.

227
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,402
See ya later.

228
00:57:25,502 --> 00:57:28,512
I'm gonna go out with
these clowns for a while.

229
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,450
That should do you some good.

230
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:35,013
Good night. -See ya.
- Good night.

231
00:58:03,484 --> 00:58:05,484
What's happening to you?

232
00:58:06,946 --> 00:58:09,106
What happened to your face?

233
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:14,416
I don't know?
- What do you mean, you don't know?

234
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,300
You've been acting strange lately.

235
00:58:17,499 --> 00:58:19,499
Like the other night.

236
00:58:21,504 --> 00:58:23,238
What night?

237
00:58:23,338 --> 00:58:25,633
The last time I saw you.

238
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:28,551
I don't remember.

239
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,482
You still care about me?

240
00:59:07,802 --> 00:59:09,802
Pete.

241
00:59:11,473 --> 00:59:13,473
Arnie.
- Where you been?

242
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,295
How you doing?
- It's good you're back...

243
00:59:16,395 --> 00:59:19,275
...Wonderful.
- Good to see you, man.

244
00:59:19,357 --> 00:59:20,173
Listen, man, a lot of people...

245
00:59:20,273 --> 00:59:23,760
...gonna be real happy that
you're back, including me.

246
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,555
Well, it's good to be back.

247
00:59:25,655 --> 00:59:27,889
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.

248
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:29,434
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

249
00:59:29,534 --> 00:59:32,160
And Mr. Eddy called.

250
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:37,150
Can I call him and tell him to come in?
- Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.

251
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:40,010
And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
- You're ready to work?

252
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:40,320
Yeah.

253
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,780
Well, let's go to work.
- All right, Buddy.

254
00:59:46,427 --> 00:59:48,427
Petey's back.

255
01:00:05,947 --> 01:00:08,107
There's 9 People down here.

256
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:13,772
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...

257
01:00:13,872 --> 01:00:16,432
...I'll let you ask the other 2.

258
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:27,967
Hey, Pete.

259
01:00:30,722 --> 01:00:32,722
Pete.

260
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:36,685
Where's Pete?

261
01:00:37,063 --> 01:00:38,506
He's back there.

262
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,606
Mr. Eddy.

263
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:43,233
Hey.

264
01:00:46,364 --> 01:00:48,364
What happened?

265
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,352
Somebody giving you trouble?
- No. No trouble.

266
01:00:50,452 --> 01:00:54,372
'Cause if somebody's giving
you trouble, Pete,...

267
01:00:54,456 --> 01:00:57,317
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that.

268
01:00:57,417 --> 01:01:01,797
No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
- I mean it, Pete. Like...that.

269
01:01:02,047 --> 01:01:04,533
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...

270
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:08,997
...just a regular tune-up?
- I want you to take a ride with me.

271
01:01:09,097 --> 01:01:11,416
I don't like the sound of something.

272
01:01:11,516 --> 01:01:17,596
OK. I got to check in with the boss.
- It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.

273
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:53,569
Pull it over, but keep it running.

274
01:02:14,281 --> 01:02:16,743
Best goddamn ears in town.

275
01:02:31,592 --> 01:02:33,592
Give that a try.

276
01:02:39,558 --> 01:02:44,688
Beautiful...Smooth as
shit from a duck's ass.

277
01:02:47,483 --> 01:02:51,243
Let's take a ride.
- Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

278
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:06,544
It's a beautiful day.

279
01:03:13,886 --> 01:03:16,526
You did a great job, Pete.
- Yeah.

280
01:03:17,223 --> 01:03:21,383
Well, you know I like working
on this car, Mr. Eddy.

281
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,320
Shit. That cocksucker doing
what I think he's doing?

282
01:04:12,405 --> 01:04:14,058
This is where mechanical excellence...

283
01:04:14,158 --> 01:04:17,827
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.

284
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:55,323
Ahh...Oh, oh, God.

285
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:04,960
Don't you ever fucking tailgate.

286
01:05:05,461 --> 01:05:07,446
Ever.
- Tell him you won't tailgate.

287
01:05:07,546 --> 01:05:08,698
Ever.

288
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:09,798
I won't ever...

289
01:05:09,898 --> 01:05:12,202
Do you know how many fucking
car lengths it takes...

290
01:05:12,302 --> 01:05:15,471
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?.

291
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,999
6 fucking car lengths.
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister.

292
01:05:20,143 --> 01:05:22,879
If I had to stop suddenly,
you would've hit me.

293
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:27,676
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual.
I want you to study that motherfucker.

294
01:05:27,776 --> 01:05:30,178
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules.

295
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:34,349
50 fucking thousand people were
killed on the highway last

296
01:05:34,449 --> 01:05:37,409
Because of fucking assholes like you.

297
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:43,960
Tell me you're going to get a manual.
- I will ge-get a manual.

298
01:05:46,671 --> 01:05:48,531
Fucking ldiot.

299
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:51,717
Oh.. Aah.. Oh, Gooood.

300
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,210
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

301
01:06:33,762 --> 01:06:37,599
But tailgating is one thing I cannot tolerate.

302
01:06:39,142 --> 01:06:41,142
Yeah, I can see that.

303
01:06:51,864 --> 01:06:53,864
Wait a minute.

304
01:06:58,245 --> 01:07:00,885
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
- No, thank you.

305
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:03,966
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

306
01:07:05,504 --> 01:07:07,114
You like pornos?

307
01:07:07,214 --> 01:07:09,673
Pornos?
- Give you a boner?

308
01:07:10,842 --> 01:07:13,637
Uh, No, No thanks. No.

309
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:16,262
Suit yourself, champ.

310
01:07:17,015 --> 01:07:21,019
Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
- You will.

311
01:07:27,609 --> 01:07:29,609
Damn.

312
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,207
Lou, you recognize that guy?

313
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:44,962
Yeah...Laurent.

314
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:59,682
What do you want?
- Want to go for a drive?

315
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:03,475
I don't know.

316
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:06,561
Get in, Baby.

317
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:30,421
Come here.

318
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:16,054
Why don't you like me?
- I do like you.

319
01:10:16,888 --> 01:10:18,888
How much?

320
01:11:27,461 --> 01:11:29,461
Oh, Pete.

321
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,220
Sheila.

322
01:11:38,598 --> 01:11:40,598
Sheila.

323
01:12:22,811 --> 01:12:24,811
What'd you change it for?

324
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:27,731
I like that.

325
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:30,233
Well, I don't.

326
01:12:39,496 --> 01:12:41,496
I like that.

327
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,240
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

328
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,591
Think you'll get a chance to
give her the once-over today?

329
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:22,691
Sure.

330
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:26,320
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?

331
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:30,032
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

332
01:13:30,132 --> 01:13:33,802
It'll be done.
- You're my man, Pete.

333
01:15:21,248 --> 01:15:25,086
Don't let that thing upset you.

334
01:15:51,055 --> 01:15:54,059
Holy smokes.

335
01:16:20,794 --> 01:16:22,794
Hey.

336
01:16:24,214 --> 01:16:26,214
I'm Alice Wakefield.

337
01:16:26,675 --> 01:16:28,675
Pete Dayton.

338
01:16:30,263 --> 01:16:33,516
I was here earlier.
- Yeah, I remember.

339
01:16:40,691 --> 01:16:43,571
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

340
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:46,945
I don't know.

341
01:16:52,703 --> 01:16:54,703
OK.

342
01:16:55,414 --> 01:16:57,894
Why don't I take you to dinner?

343
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:04,466
Look, I don't think this is a very good idea.

344
01:17:12,099 --> 01:17:14,099
Do you have a phone?

345
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,770
Yeah.

346
01:17:18,814 --> 01:17:21,214
It's right...lt's right there.

347
01:17:21,817 --> 01:17:24,617
I have to call myself another taxi.

348
01:17:35,164 --> 01:17:37,164
Hello? Van Nuys?

349
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:41,420
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

350
01:17:55,018 --> 01:17:59,924
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...

351
01:18:00,024 --> 01:18:03,164
Hello. Yeah, we're not
going to need that cab.

352
01:18:03,264 --> 01:18:05,264
Thanks.

353
01:18:20,254 --> 01:18:23,257
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

354
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:58,833
Take my clothes off.

355
01:19:02,547 --> 01:19:05,907
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

356
01:19:56,521 --> 01:19:59,524
I want more.
- Me, too.

357
01:20:04,046 --> 01:20:05,386
Can I call you?

358
01:20:05,486 --> 01:20:09,886
Yeah. Call me at home.
I'll give you the number.

359
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,350
OK, Baby.

360
01:20:45,881 --> 01:20:51,096
Hey. Up here. Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.

361
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,677
I'll get it.
Hello?

362
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,763
Meow, meow. It's me.

363
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,013
Hey, Baby.

364
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:38,770
I can't see you tonight.

365
01:21:42,232 --> 01:21:44,232
OK.

366
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:48,070
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.

367
01:21:48,614 --> 01:21:50,614
Sure.

368
01:21:52,076 --> 01:21:57,206
I think he suspects something.
We have to be careful.

369
01:22:00,293 --> 01:22:02,293
I miss you.

370
01:22:05,841 --> 01:22:07,841
Pete?

371
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:10,260
Me, too.

372
01:22:11,512 --> 01:22:13,557
I'll call you again.

373
01:23:52,118 --> 01:23:54,118
What a fucking job.

374
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,580
His or ours, Lou?

375
01:23:58,332 --> 01:24:00,332
Ours, Hank.

376
01:24:24,986 --> 01:24:27,530
Hey.
- Sit down a minute.

377
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:31,159
What's up?
- Sit down.

378
01:24:33,828 --> 01:24:35,828
You don't look so good.

379
01:24:36,165 --> 01:24:39,417
No, I just...just have a headache.

380
01:24:40,878 --> 01:24:42,878
What's going on?

381
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:46,090
The police called us.

382
01:24:48,219 --> 01:24:49,287
What'd they want?

383
01:24:49,387 --> 01:24:52,121
They want to know if we had a chance...

384
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:55,668
...to find out what happened
to you the other night.

385
01:24:55,768 --> 01:24:59,608
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

386
01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:05,259
But I don't remember anything.

387
01:25:06,905 --> 01:25:09,199
What'd you tell them?

388
01:25:14,746 --> 01:25:17,466
We're not going to say anything...

389
01:25:17,582 --> 01:25:20,302
...about that night to the police.

390
01:25:22,839 --> 01:25:25,216
We saw you that night, Pete.

391
01:25:28,678 --> 01:25:31,718
You came home with your friend Sheila.

392
01:25:33,308 --> 01:25:35,308
Sheila?

393
01:25:37,478 --> 01:25:40,023
Yeah. There was a man with you.

394
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:45,385
What is this? I mean, why
didn't you tell me anything?

395
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,200
Who's the man?

396
01:25:53,328 --> 01:25:56,665
I've never seen him before in my life.

397
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:04,130
What happened to me?

398
01:26:06,843 --> 01:26:10,096
Please, please, Dad, Tell me.

399
01:26:28,949 --> 01:26:30,949
Hey, Pete. Hey.

400
01:26:31,535 --> 01:26:33,535
Hey.

401
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,201
Hey.

402
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:48,301
Mr. Eddy.

403
01:26:57,938 --> 01:27:00,065
Hey, Pete.

404
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:03,026
How you doing?
- I'm OK.

405
01:27:03,236 --> 01:27:06,389
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

406
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:09,849
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.

407
01:27:10,617 --> 01:27:15,415
Her name is Alice. I swear,
I love that girl to death.

408
01:27:18,043 --> 01:27:22,363
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

409
01:27:24,758 --> 01:27:26,758
I'd take this...

410
01:27:26,885 --> 01:27:31,164
...and I'd shove it so far up his ass,
it would come out his mouth.

411
01:27:31,264 --> 01:27:34,685
And then you know what I'd do?
- What?

412
01:27:35,562 --> 01:27:38,397
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

413
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:49,576
Hey. You're looking good.

414
01:27:50,617 --> 01:27:52,617
What you been up to?

415
01:28:02,338 --> 01:28:04,338
I'll get it.

416
01:28:05,592 --> 01:28:07,592
Hello?

417
01:28:08,512 --> 01:28:15,018
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

418
01:28:20,566 --> 01:28:22,566
He'll kill us.

419
01:28:25,654 --> 01:28:27,654
Are you...

420
01:28:29,576 --> 01:28:31,478
...positive that he knows?

421
01:28:31,578 --> 01:28:34,581
I'm not positive, but he knows.

422
01:28:37,167 --> 01:28:43,006
So...What are we supposed to do?

423
01:28:46,051 --> 01:28:48,051
I don't know.

424
01:29:18,669 --> 01:29:24,008
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

425
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:30,596
I know a guy.

426
01:29:32,851 --> 01:29:36,104
He pays girls to party with him.

427
01:29:36,812 --> 01:29:39,212
He's always got a lot of cash.

428
01:29:40,191 --> 01:29:42,191
He'd be easy to rob.

429
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:48,242
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.

430
01:29:50,244 --> 01:29:52,538
We could be together.

431
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:03,168
Have you partied with him?

432
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:11,430
Did you like it?

433
01:30:12,975 --> 01:30:14,975
No.

434
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:17,061
It was part of the deal.

435
01:30:17,773 --> 01:30:19,773
What deal?

436
01:30:23,153 --> 01:30:25,698
He works for Mr. Eddy.
- Yeah?

437
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:30,250
And what's he do?
- He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

438
01:30:30,494 --> 01:30:33,831
Pornos?
- Yeah.

439
01:30:34,957 --> 01:30:37,610
How did you get in with these
fucking people, Alice?

440
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:41,710
Pete...
- No. Pete. I want to know how it happened.

441
01:30:46,302 --> 01:30:48,429
It was a long time ago.

442
01:30:50,181 --> 01:30:54,821
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

443
01:30:56,063 --> 01:30:58,107
He told me about a job.

444
01:31:03,487 --> 01:31:05,487
In pornos?

445
01:31:08,034 --> 01:31:13,247
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.

446
01:31:16,292 --> 01:31:19,962
He made an appointment
for me to see a man.

447
01:31:21,047 --> 01:31:23,047
I went to this place.

448
01:31:25,301 --> 01:31:27,861
They made me wait there forever.

449
01:31:29,682 --> 01:31:32,402
There was a guy guarding the door.

450
01:31:36,564 --> 01:31:41,124
In another room, there was this
other guy lifting weights.

451
01:31:46,657 --> 01:31:48,737
I started getting nervous.

452
01:31:50,953 --> 01:31:53,414
When it got dark...

453
01:31:54,582 --> 01:31:57,835
...they brought me into this other room.

454
01:34:21,345 --> 01:34:23,806
Why didn't you just leave?

455
01:34:32,064 --> 01:34:34,275
You liked it, huh?

456
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:43,368
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.

457
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:51,156
I don't want you to go away.

458
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,200
I don't want you to go away.

459
01:35:04,181 --> 01:35:06,181
I love you, Alice.

460
01:35:10,355 --> 01:35:12,899
Should I call Andy?
- Andy?

461
01:35:14,818 --> 01:35:18,418
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

462
01:35:18,822 --> 01:35:21,574
Yeah. Call him.

463
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:27,172
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

464
01:35:27,331 --> 01:35:30,051
You meet me at his place at 11:00.

465
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:34,922
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.

466
01:35:35,631 --> 01:35:41,804
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.

467
01:35:42,013 --> 01:35:45,167
It's a white Stucco job
on the south side of the street.

468
01:35:45,267 --> 01:35:50,063
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.

469
01:35:50,438 --> 01:35:54,427
Go through the kitchen into the living room.
There's a bar there.

470
01:35:54,527 --> 01:35:58,823
At 11:15, I'll send Andy
down to fix me a drink.

471
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:02,790
And when he does,
you crack him on the head, OK?

472
01:36:06,789 --> 01:36:08,789
OK.

473
01:36:37,613 --> 01:36:40,432
You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
- Sheila.

474
01:36:40,532 --> 01:36:43,019
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila. Sheila, stop it.

475
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:45,438
You don't call. Who is she?
- Stop it.

476
01:36:45,538 --> 01:36:47,545
What's the bitch's name?
- I'm sorry.

477
01:36:47,645 --> 01:36:48,608
Oh, you're sorry?

478
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:49,769
Go home.
- You're sorry?

479
01:36:49,869 --> 01:36:50,485
Sheila, stop it.

480
01:36:50,585 --> 01:36:52,737
You're sorry, you piece of shit.

481
01:36:52,837 --> 01:36:54,406
You're sorry?
- Go home.

482
01:36:54,506 --> 01:36:55,978
Fuck you...Fuck you.
- Sheila, stop, Sheila.

483
01:36:56,078 --> 01:36:56,825
Fuck you... Fuck you.

484
01:36:56,925 --> 01:36:59,703
Fuck you...Fuck you.
- Sheila...Sheila.

485
01:36:59,803 --> 01:37:04,043
Sheila. Let's both go in
and talk about this quietly.

486
01:37:04,432 --> 01:37:06,432
Sheila, come on.

487
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:10,773
You are different.
- Sheila.

488
01:37:11,106 --> 01:37:13,400
Tell him...Tell him.

489
01:37:13,609 --> 01:37:16,445
Sheila, don't. Don't.

490
01:37:17,905 --> 01:37:24,871
I don't care anymore anyway.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

491
01:37:25,455 --> 01:37:31,544
I won't bother you, or any member
of your family ever again.

492
01:37:46,226 --> 01:37:48,226
Pete?

493
01:37:50,355 --> 01:37:52,515
There's a man on the phone.

494
01:37:53,276 --> 01:37:56,316
He's called a couple of times tonight.

495
01:37:56,529 --> 01:37:58,529
Who is it?

496
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:01,740
He won't give his name.

497
01:38:20,597 --> 01:38:22,414
Hello?

498
01:38:22,514 --> 01:38:25,058
Hey, Pete, how you doing?

499
01:38:27,394 --> 01:38:31,691
Who is this?
- You know who it is.

500
01:38:35,195 --> 01:38:37,195
Mr. Eddy?

501
01:38:37,529 --> 01:38:40,534
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

502
01:38:41,326 --> 01:38:45,247
OK.
- You're doing OK? That's good, Pete.

503
01:38:47,249 --> 01:38:53,589
Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
- I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.

504
01:38:55,799 --> 01:39:00,705
You're sure you're OK?
Everything all right?

505
01:39:00,805 --> 01:39:02,805
Yeah.

506
01:39:03,849 --> 01:39:08,089
I'm really glad to know
you're doing good, Pete. Hey.

507
01:39:08,395 --> 01:39:11,515
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.

508
01:39:16,029 --> 01:39:18,573
We've met before, haven't we?

509
01:39:20,033 --> 01:39:22,033
I don't think so.

510
01:39:23,662 --> 01:39:25,939
Where is it you think we've met?

511
01:39:26,039 --> 01:39:29,960
At your house. Don't you remember?

512
01:39:33,714 --> 01:39:37,635
No. No, I don't.

513
01:39:39,095 --> 01:39:41,889
In the East, the far East...

514
01:39:42,098 --> 01:39:44,770
...when a person is sentenced to death,

515
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:48,171
they're sent to a place
where they can't escape.

516
01:39:48,271 --> 01:39:52,885
Never knowing when an executioner
may step up behind them...

517
01:39:52,985 --> 01:39:56,637
...and fire a bullet into
the back of their head.

518
01:39:56,737 --> 01:39:58,737
What's going on?

519
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:02,079
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

520
01:40:02,786 --> 01:40:09,186
Pete, I just wanted to jump on and
tell you that I'm really glad you're doing OK.

521
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:25,639
You got him.

522
01:43:26,016 --> 01:43:28,016
Alice.

523
01:44:24,494 --> 01:44:26,494
Wow.

524
01:44:29,124 --> 01:44:31,124
We killed him.

525
01:44:39,928 --> 01:44:42,055
You killed him.

526
01:44:45,182 --> 01:44:47,182
Alice?

527
01:44:51,648 --> 01:44:53,648
Alice?

528
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:56,359
What do we do?

529
01:44:57,321 --> 01:44:59,321
What do we do?

530
01:45:00,324 --> 01:45:02,324
We have to get the stuff.

531
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:06,780
We have to get out of here.

532
01:45:21,887 --> 01:45:23,887
Ah, fuck.

533
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:01,510
Is that you?

534
01:46:02,221 --> 01:46:04,221
Are both of them you?

535
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,400
That's me.

536
01:46:17,488 --> 01:46:19,949
Honey, are you all right?

537
01:46:24,996 --> 01:46:26,996
Where's the bathroom?

538
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,919
It's upstairs, down the hall.

539
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:30,639
Did you want to talk to me?

540
01:47:33,234 --> 01:47:36,237
Did you want to ask me, why?

541
01:48:34,173 --> 01:48:36,173
What's the matter?

542
01:48:39,094 --> 01:48:41,094
Don't you trust me, Pete?

543
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,608
Stick this in your pants.

544
01:48:58,948 --> 01:49:01,244
I know a fence.

545
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:09,432
He'll give us money, get us passports
in exchange for all this shit...

546
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:11,626
...and Andy's car...

547
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:15,091
And then we can go anywhere.

548
01:49:30,282 --> 01:49:32,282
Come on, Baby.

549
01:49:48,133 --> 01:49:50,133
Pete, you drive.

550
01:50:05,235 --> 01:50:08,035
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

551
01:50:10,407 --> 01:50:12,647
Where the fuck are we going?

552
01:50:15,288 --> 01:50:18,008
We have to go to the desert, Baby.

553
01:50:20,042 --> 01:50:22,503
The fence I told you about...

554
01:50:26,507 --> 01:50:28,507
He's at his cabin.

555
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:44,079
Come on.

556
01:52:31,088 --> 01:52:33,088
We'll have to wait.

557
01:52:53,987 --> 01:52:56,698
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?

558
01:53:04,498 --> 01:53:07,298
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

559
01:53:10,546 --> 01:53:12,674
More than ever.

560
01:55:14,009 --> 01:55:16,009
I want you.

561
01:55:24,311 --> 01:55:26,311
I want you.

562
01:55:44,207 --> 01:55:46,207
I want you.

563
01:55:47,377 --> 01:55:49,377
I want you.

564
01:56:07,598 --> 01:56:11,770
You'll never have me.

565
01:57:16,587 --> 01:57:18,587
Here I am.

566
01:58:09,310 --> 01:58:15,650
Where's Alice?
- Alice who? Her name is Renee.

567
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:19,660
If she told you her name
is Alice, she's lying.

568
01:58:23,783 --> 01:58:28,037
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?.

569
02:01:50,575 --> 02:01:52,575
Renee?

570
02:02:01,669 --> 02:02:03,756
You're coming with me.

571
02:04:06,593 --> 02:04:09,304
What do you guys want?

572
02:05:24,382 --> 02:05:26,382
Now you can hand it back.

573
02:05:36,146 --> 02:05:38,355
You and me, Mister...

574
02:05:41,525 --> 02:05:45,572
We can really outugly them sumbitches...

575
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:48,530
Can't we?

576
02:06:43,959 --> 02:06:46,419
Ed...Take a look at this.

577
02:06:53,385 --> 02:06:55,545
Yeah. That's her all right.

578
02:06:56,763 --> 02:07:00,363
That's Fred Madison's
wife with Dick Laurent.

579
02:07:00,684 --> 02:07:03,004
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.

580
02:07:04,271 --> 02:07:07,675
We got Pete Dayton's prints
all over this place.

581
02:07:07,775 --> 02:07:09,855
You know what I think, Ed?

582
02:07:11,403 --> 02:07:14,123
What is it, AI? What do you think?

583
02:07:14,782 --> 02:07:18,862
I think there's no such
thing as a bad coincidence.

584
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:23,060
Dick Laurent is dead.
