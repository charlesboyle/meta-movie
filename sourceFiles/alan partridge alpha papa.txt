00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,387
just because it's so ﬂat
and there was a sort of a..

171
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,349
a bleakness about the place,
but obviously now..

172
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,980
You're a good broadcaster, Alan.
Don't forget that.

173
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,228
- I wasn't planning to, Pat.
- You seen this memo?

174
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,519
"Exciting new phase.
Here's to the future."

175
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,359
- My days are numbered.
- No-one's getting sacked.

176
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:50,367
It's like Bobby Brushes, the caretaker, when
the swimming pool allegations came out.

177
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,614
- He was in bits.
- Yeah.

178
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,622
It turned out he was just helping those
lads towel off. He was being nice.

179
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,416
- He didn't even know them.
- Yeah, but where is he now?

180
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,454
- He runs his own business.
- There. He's back on his feet.

181
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,337
Rents out bouncy castles.

182
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,214
For adults, yeah?

183
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,343
- Look at this memo.
- I've seen the memo. It's quite simple.

184
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,471
Goredale Media are simply re-imagining
our core brand values

185
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,475
and giving it a name more fitting
to multi-platform content delivery.

186
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,098
- They're people people.
- People people sack people.

187
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,435
No, Pat. People sack people.
People people please people.

188
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,817
- Can you have a word with them, Alan?
- Would you?

189
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,521
Er.. sure. As soon as I can get them
all in the same room together.

190
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,531
<b>- They're all up in the boardroom now.
- That's great.</b>

191
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,988
Thank you. Thank you, Alan.
You're a pal.

192
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,370
Well, pals is pals.

193
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:41,376
If we're all looking at the last quarterly
figures for North Norfolk on page 6.

194
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,832
Then if you turn to page 5.

195
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,134
Hi, guys, don't want to be an
agenda-bender, but any chance of a wa-wa?

196
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,088
- It's not a good time, Alan.
- It's fine, we've time. Come in.

197
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,596
Oh, we moved the other thing.
Yeah, it's a good time.

198
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,305
Alan. Alan Partridge.

199
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,603
Jason Tresswell,
MD of Goredale Media.

200
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,107
It's not "Alan Alan Partridge".
It's "Alan, comma, Alan Partridge".

201
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,063
I know some people do have two names.

202
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,103
Zsa Zsa Gabor, for instance.

203
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,021
Duran Duran.

204
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,986
Yeah, that's not as good.

205
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,947
Um.. Kris Kristofferson.

206
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,162
Excellent small talk.
Gentlemen, to business.

207
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,867
I am here as one of the more senior
D-jocks at this station.

208
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,831
I'm here to talk about jobs.

209
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,460
Like a Nazi officer this, isn't it?

210
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,541
Should er.. snap my heels together.

211
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,296
<b>- Achtung!!
- Guten Tag.</b>

212
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,257
Silence!! Sorry. I meant to miss you.

213
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,513
I want you to do something for me.

214
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:41,015
I want you to take all your prejudices,
put them in a box marked "prejudices",

215
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,143
put it to one side, wipe the prejudice
juice off your hands..

216
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,226
Can I just stop you there?
Change is healthy, you shouldn't fear it.

217
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,690
I'm not scared of anything.
Not even an elephant,

218
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,605
which is interesting,
because there's one in this room.

219
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,566
- Wanna know his name?
- Pat Farrell.

220
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,360
It's Pat Farrell. Pat's audience is old.

221
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,701
Old people, much like
dogs, are blindly loyal.

222
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,537
And if Pat hi-tails it to
Cedar FM and they follow,

223
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,920
you've got a grey exodus on your hands.
A grexodus.

224
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:12,050
Hm. That prejudices box doesn't
seem quite so cool any more, does it?

225
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,757
Yeah, but we bought Cedar FM as well.

226
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,263
I didn't know that.
I did not know that.

227
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,024
- The point is..
- You were talking about Pat Farrell.

228
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,693
Pat Farrell is a great guy.

229
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,698
He's always the first to speak up
at union meetings,

230
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,488
being a member of a union.

231
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:43,040
He's also Irish, which again, weirdly,
a plus point, if you like swearing.

232
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,950
"Feckin' dis" and "Feckin' dat".

233
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,711
Some Irish people say “Feck off"
isn't as bad as "Fuck off"

234
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,713
but I think that's bullshit
or bellshit.

235
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,092
- The bottom line is, he swears too much.
- This is all very interesting..

236
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,093
I can sum up Pat Farrell in ten words.

237
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,927
Pat isn't very good so let him go, guys,
seriously.

238
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,550
I can condense that to three words.

239
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,309
Just sack Pat.

240
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,194
That completes my presentation.

241
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,531
Gentlemen, I'll leave
you to your biscuits.

242
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,497
Gloves.

243
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,161
Oh, fuck.

244
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,666
Glove.

245
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,213

00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,966

247
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,922
Ahhh!! That was soft rock
cocaine enthusiasts, Fleetwood Mac.

248
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,182
And this was Mid-Morning Matters.

249
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,725
Where once again,

250
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,931
- mid-morning.. mattered.
- Mattered.

251
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,472
Supposed to do it in sync.

252
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,273
<b>- Always leave a gap.
- Sorry.</b>

253
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,809
Simple. Very simple.

254
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,984
You're listening to Shape -
The Way You Want It To Be.

255
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,283
Mm-hm. Right. And will it take long?

256
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,834
It will take long. OK.
Hi, Pat. I'll catch you later.

257
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,045
I'm not happy about it, but..

258
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,083
I'll have to go along with it, won't I?

259
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:22,723
The.. The problem is that the phone
rings even when I'm speaking on it,

260
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,848
so it sounds bloody weird.

261
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,021
In fact, I think it just did it then.
Did you hear it? Yes?

262
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,273
Yeah. He heard it too.

263
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,068
OK, well, I'll leave it with you.

264
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,194
Mm-hm. Yep.

265
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,730
Yep.

266
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,694
All right. Thanks, Susan.

267
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,328
If Geoff Susan doesn't mend that phone,
there'll be hell to pay.

268
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,582
They wouldn't even let me say goodbye
to my listeners.

269
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,243
Just gave me 30 minutes
to clear out my locker.

270
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,955
Well, at least I'm getting
their mugs dirty.

271
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,208
Thanks, Alan.
You always stuck up for me.

272
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,297
Not like the others.

273
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,339
Well, I'll let you get back to.. Geoff.

274
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,802
- Who's Geoff?
- Geoff Susan.

275
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,512
Oh, yes, of course.

276
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,393
Ahhhhh..

277
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,320
I did the right thing, didn't I, Lynn?

278
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,195
I mean, I think he knew his days
were numbered.

279
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,325
More of an assisted suicide really.

280
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,740
I just ﬂew him to Switzerland
and filled out a few forms and..

281
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,454
sloped off to the airport.

282
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,502
I've got to be honest, Lynn,
I'm feeling pretty crummy.

283
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,960
Pat's Irish, isn't he?

284
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,669
To be sure.

285
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,585
Why don't you donate
£50 to Sinn Fein?

286
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,470
Perfect.

287
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,135
Love that noise.

288
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,016
Keep me away from the sausage rolls.

289
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,722
I'm wearing my chubby clothes again.

290
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,975
- I noticed.
- What the chub, or the clothes?

291
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,764
- 'Dad.
' MS/"Dad.

292
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,849
Not that funny, Lynn.

293
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,935
Bounce

294
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,361
- I used to go with prostitutes.
- Brilliant.

295
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,323
Cocaine - that was a trigger.
Cocaine, prostitutes.

296
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,327
<b>Bit of a cycle. Puking up the old er..
luminous green bile.</b>

297
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,083
Yeah, I was withdrawing.

298
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,995
I've got my minder with me.

299
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,038
- Lynn?
- She might not seem tough

300
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,583
but I once saw her stamp on
50 cockroaches in a minute.

301
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,467
He didn't see. He was in the next room.

302
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,503
<b>- It was in Wales.
- It's true, yeah.</b>

303
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,594
All I could hear was crunch, crunch,
crunch, stamp, stamp, stamp.

304
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,851
I thought she was country dancing
whilst eating cereal.

305
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,013
I thought it was the End of Days.
They were legion.

306
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,601
Lynn likes The Bible.

307
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,604
I've never understood moths.

308
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,394
They only come out at night,
yet they're attracted to light.

309
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,802
I don't know why they just don't
come out during the day.

310
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,657
I've nothing to add to that.
If you substituted butterﬂy..

311
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,739
Could you go and get me
some sausage rolls?

312
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,826
If you substituted butterﬂy for moth,
I think it would sound like poetry, yeah.

313
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,787
Unfortunately, Wordsworth didn't say:

314
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,795
"I wandered lonely as a moth
to eat some jumpers in a drawer"

315
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,211
"As if that wasn't bad enough,
it ate my sock upon the moor"

316
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,266
Yeah. It's just.. I don't know why
a sock could be on the moor.

317
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,393
A mitten, maybe.

318
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,896
I actually spewed up some
of my stomach lining.

319
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,103
I don't know if you've ever done er..
done any horse, have you?

320
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,940
- I've ridden a donkey.
- No, no, no, I mean heroin.

321
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,525
I know what you mean.
No, I've not done heroin.

322
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,532
- I don't like subtitles in my films.
- If you can read, read a book.

323
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,240
Citizen Kane. Black and white.
I haven't seen that.

324
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,656
I tell you what, the best film for me,
ever, is still The Godfather.

325
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,916
- Ah, amazing film.
- Perfect film.

326
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,543
"I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.“

327
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,545
- Amazing acting, though.
- Great acting.

328
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,001
I tell you what's even better-

329
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,714
a lot of people are shocked when I say
this - the camera angles.

330
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,719
<b>- Alan, I need a word.
- Camera angles?</b>

331
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,263
It's rather delicate.

332
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,517
Remember when you took me for that
Christmas meal at the ice rink?

333
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,973
You remember that woman
disinfecting the boots?

334
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,313
The one that took a shine to you?

335
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,600
I went home and you and her..

336
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,727
Well, it's.. none of my business.

337
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,148
It is none of your business, but for
the record, went back to her place,

338
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,818
watched Air Crash Investigation,
then I fell asleep in her big armchair.

339
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,406
A perfectly normal woman.

340
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,162
Well, she's here.

341
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,369
Lynn, get rid of her.
She's a drunk racist.

342
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,121
- I'll tolerate one, but not both.
- Fine.

343
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,541
But you said I could pop by any time.

344
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,956
I know, but my career's
hanging by a thread.

345
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,295
- And I'm an embarrassment, am I?
- No, no.

346
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,923
You just wanted sex, you used me.

347
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,679
Well, maybe you used me.

348
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,932
L-I didn't have much of a say
over what went on that night.

349
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,602
Didn't hear you complaining.

350
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,271
- I couldn't speak.
- See you round mine again, then.

351
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,976
I.. don't know, I'm.. I'm..

352
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,357
- What's wrong with my place?
- Well.. all those dogs barking.

353
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,192
But it's their bedroom too.

354
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,490
May I have a word?

355
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,538
You're talking clap.. crap!!

356
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,496
I sound like a fucking Chinky
when I'm pissed!!

357
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,548
There we go. All done.

358
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,169
- What did you say to her?
- I told her that God loves everyone.

359
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,629
<b>Even sluts.</b>

360
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,015
- Good night, Lynn.
- Night, Alan.

361
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,160
Hello?

362
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,287
V funny. Tee-hee.

363
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,706
Very impressive.

364
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,215
Oh, they must have left in a hurry.
Something weird's happened.

365
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,977
All right, you freaked me out, so just..
pack it..

366
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,356
There you are!!

367
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,983
Pat? Agh!!

368
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,609
I'm down.

369
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,497
You..

370
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,788
You step to me?

371
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,420
Simon.

372
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,175
Er..

373
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,336
Yeah, all right.
I'll go on without you.

374
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,237
Stop!! Stop!! Stop!!

375
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,819
- I need to commandeer this vehicle.
- What?

376
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,824
- There's a mad man with a gun.
- Um..

377
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,077
- He's Irish!!
- Get in.

378
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,329
Why do you sit so close to the wheel?
I could steer with my balls!!

379
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,745
- Where's the nearest police station?
- Just here.

380
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,789
Oh.. thanks.

381
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,050
Are you Alan Partrid..?

382
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,676
Assault, battery, kidnap,
chronic thuggery,

383
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,430
brandishment, actual bodily harm,
grievous bodily harm..

384
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,887
<b>- ..harm.
- Just stick to what you saw</b>

385
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,393
and we'll decide if it's ABH or GBH.

386
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,729
- You mean aitch?
- That's what I said.

387
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,518
Nearly, you said haitch.

388
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,685
"Ha" is the sound of the letter,
aitch is its name.

389
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,864
One is ha, the other is aitch.
Neither is "haitch".

390
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,899
<b>- I'm sorry, I'm a bit nervous.
- Mr Partridge?</b>

391
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,319
- Something else we need to talk about.
- Oh..

392
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,579
- You're not in trouble.
- Oh, fine.

393
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,084
I've never been in a police car before.

394
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,336
May I lower the window, please?

395
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,090
<b>Foxtrot Sierra. Alpha
Papa arriving at the school building.</b>

396
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,971
- Officer.
- Mr Partridge.

397
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,009
- You were at the police station.
- I was just in the car with you.

398
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,222
- If you want to follow me, please.
- Huh.

399
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,479
- This way, please, sir.
- Yep.

400
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,391
Let's do it.

401
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,314
Mr Partridge, this is the Gold Commander
of the operation.

402
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:22,326
- Seriously, is that what you're called?
- On this operation, yes.

403
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,403
I'm Acting Chief Constable
Janet Whitehead.

404
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,286
- An honour.
- And I'm Martin Fitch.

405
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,284
Send.

406
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,999
From Scotland Yard's
Hostage and Crisis Unit.

407
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,004
Here to lead the negotiation.

408
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,257
Er.. little bit awkward.
Who's in charge?

409
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,964
Make no mistake, this lady is in charge.

410
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:43,423
So here's the situation.
Pat is refusing to speak to us directly.

411
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,560
He's willing to give us three hostages but
only if he can talk to us through you.

412
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:52,394
Now, we need to know why Pat has done this so
we can draw things to a peaceful conclusion.

413
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,354
Yeah, sure, I'll talk to him. Deal.

414
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,610
Sorry, wrong person.

415
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,609
Come here.

416
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,531
OK. Now, are you on any medication?

417
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,695
Er.. Just some cream.

418
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,742
I've got very aggressive athlete's foot but
that's the only thing about me that is.

419
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,003
Do you suffer from any nervous
conditions, such as panic attacks?

420
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,255
Do I look like I suffer
from panic attacks?

421
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,542
I've had one panic attack in a car wash.

422
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,837
It was a perfect storm
of no sleep, no wife,

423
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,673
and angry brushes whirring towards me.

424
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,768
By the time the giant hair dryer
came on, I was in the footwell.

425
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,435
Does the idea of weaponry trouble you?

426
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,228
Er.. no. I've fired several riﬂes,
at fun fairs, and won prizes.

427
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,364
But I've never fired one
in anger, or at a cat.

428
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,571
We'll have you fully briefed
by the tactical firearms team.

429
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,700
Cool.

430
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,362
We'll keep in regular phone
contact with you when you go in.

431
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,122
Very cool. Sorry, go in?

432
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,749
- What, into the building?
- Mm-hm.

433
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,412
- To speak to Pat in person?
- Yes, is that not what you..

434
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,711
- Erm..
- Everything OK?

435
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,553
I'm just a little nervous about
going into a car wash.. er.. siege.

436
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,427
So what do you say, Al?
Will you help us?

437
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,103
Yep.

438
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,066
Guys, none of us choose
the hand we're dealt..

439
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,483
- You know..
- We do need an answer, I'm afraid.

440
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,284
Do you have another siege to go to?

441
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,204
It's my understanding that if you say
yes, you're allowed a few words.

442
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,577
- So you are saying yes?
- I was leaving that to the end.

443
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,367
- If you'd like to come with me.
- Sure.

444
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,535
Can I get a copy of that?

445
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,296
- Let's keep this simple, shall we?
- Roger, that.

446
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,207
<b>- No heroics.
- Ten-four, good buddy.</b>

447
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,417
Do not physically engage him.

448
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,053
- Fight a gun, ﬂee a knife, yeah?
- Where do you read that?

449
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,179
Big fans of you guys in TFU.

450
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,887
If I had my way, all police
officers would carry firearms.

451
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,929
I think that firearms should remain
in the hands of specialists.

452
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,314
I was going to say that only specialists
should be allowed to fire them.

453
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,192
If you think I've just made that up,
you can call my assistant.

454
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,523
Alan!! Read my lips.

455
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,939
If you jeopardize the safety
of any of my men,

456
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,450
or any of those hostages
because you've not been listening to me,

457
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,239
I will take off this police uniform
and I will make you pay for it.

458
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,749
You want me to buy your police
uniform off you?

459
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,536
No. I'll give you a fucking good hiding,
is that clear?

460
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,579
Yes, that's clear. Yes.
That's clear.

461
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,840
You're close to me.

462
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,339
Now, you're a smart bloke,
I know you can handle it.

463
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,675
- I know you won't disappoint me.
- I won't.

464
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,636
<b>I aim to please you,
and I.. I hope to impress you.</b>

465
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,469
- Good man.
- Yeah, you're a good man too.

466
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,225
Right, well, Dom will fill you in.

467
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,528
He has to say all that
shit for the insurance.

468
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,405
- Right.
- Tell me this much, mate.

469
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,942
- What's your favourite siege?
- Iranian Embassy.

470
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,235
Same. Why?

471
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,002
They used the sound of a pneumatic drill

472
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,332
to disguise the noise of them removing
bricks from a neighbouring wall.

473
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,285
- So they could smash through and..
- Take them out the game.

474
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,545
It's just a great siege.

475
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,789
Right.

476
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,709
Do you want to see my gun?

477
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,178
Does erm.. Yes, please.

478
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,474
Let's clock the Glock.

479
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,803
You'll have to move quicker than that.

480
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,723
- Any last messages for your kids?
- Oh.. Er..

481
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,607
No, they don't speak to me any more.

482
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,689
Yeah, "Why don't you
speak to me any more?"

483
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,399
I wouldn't know the answer, would I?

484
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:30,442
<b>So just um.. just..
tell them I love them.</b>

485
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,910
Pat, Alan's coming in now.

486
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,472
- Greg!!
- Oh.. Hey, Alan. Thanks.

487
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,559
- They let you go as well?
- I'm relieved to be getting out of there.

488
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,191
- Aren't there still women in there?
- Yeah, well..

489
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,770
I think it would be a bit sexist
to let all the women go out first.

490
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,234
Yeah. Sleep well, Greg.

491
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,944
Thanks.

492
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,493
Pat?

493
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,243
Pat?

494
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,290
Pat?

495
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,597
<b>- Prepare to die.
- I'm not ready to!!</b>

496
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,183
Alan, it's OK, it's OK, it's me.

497
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,344
It's me - Pat.

498
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,602
God, you..

499
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:45,187
I just thought a little jokey costume
would, you know, put you at ease,

500
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,353
- give you a giggle.
- Well.. mission accomplished.

501
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,570
Oh, God.

502
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,697
- It's great to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

503
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,700
I bought you some cake,
not that you deserve it after that.

504
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,237
I should just crush it in my hand.
Oh, I already have.

505
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,327
- How the devil are you?
- Yeah, not bad, not bad.

506
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,912
How are you feeling?

507
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,748
- Great!!
- Good.

508
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,296
Oh, er.. the police told
me to bring you this.

509
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,127
It's just a standard field phone,

510
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,509
should you feel the inclination
to communicate with ze authorities.

511
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,138
Good thing about these things, they're
immune to the problems and glitches

512
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,390
you get with satellite phones.

513
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,427
But, like I say, it's
just an option, really.

514
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:27,108
I just realised, when you asked me
now how I was feeling, you meant..

515
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,268
Yes, I did.

516
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,280
- Does this answer your question?
- Yes, it does.

517
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,532
Oh, hello.
Didn't see you there.

518
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,693
Someone's been in the wars.

519
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,157
- That's just Simon.
- Can he breathe through that?

520
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,197
Of course. It's just
like wearing a mask.

521
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,163
At least when someone puts you in
a mask, you've got a safe word,

522
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,373
like "airbag", or "crayfish".

523
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,752
What's the er..
That thing?

524
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,550
Oh, we made that. It's a head holster.

525
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,430
- Never heard of one of those.
- Yeah, I'll show you. Simon?

526
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,848
You insert the shotgun.

527
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,350
Place on stand.
And.. voilá.

528
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,978
Hands free. I can move around
the studio, do anything I want.

529
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,266
And if something happens..
I don't even have to look.

530
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,814
Boom. Hit the target.

531
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,195
Yeah.. well,
you don't need an accomplice.

532
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,321
Well, I've got you now.

533
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,982
Yeah.

534
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,827
Thank you.

535
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,328
So you're with the police now?

536
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,745
<b>Oh, this.. no, this is just..</b>

537
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,879
I think it's Velcro.
There you go.

538
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,586
Feck the police.

539
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,339
I think they thought that
if they did take a pot shot at you -

540
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,174
it's a siege, you've got a gun -

541
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,510
that the bullet might pass through you
and hit me.

542
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,925
Unless they use dum-dums,
which explode inside the body.

543
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,262
I said, do not use dum-dums on
Pat Ferrell, Farrell, Ferrell.

544
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,227
Just use a high-velocity round
that passes through his body

545
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,933
because he's a friend of mine.

546
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,943
And I suppose if I want to shoot you,
I can always aim for the head.

547
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,479
Exactly. Exactly.

548
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,940
Um.. I don't even
know why I'm wearing it.

549
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,363
- So take it off.
- I'll happily take it off.

550
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,697
Go on, then.

551
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,302
- If you want me to, I'll take it off.
- Fucking take it off!!

552
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,949
Oh, Pat, now you're making
me want to wear it.

553
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,080
This is not my bag.

554
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,877
I'm-I'm-I'm.. a disc jockey.

555
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,004
I'm sorry you got the sack.

556
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:17,418
I'm 55 years old, I should be at home in
bed watching funny videos on YouTube.

557
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,429
"Sneezing panda" or
"Charlie bit my finger".

558
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,558
Have you seen
"Fat woman falls down the hole"?

559
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,647
- That's hilarious. Isn't it?
- Yeah.

560
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,774
I've seen it before, but, yeah.

561
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:37,029
That.. That should be fenced off really,
but erm.. I'm glad it wasn't.

562
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,026
Great.

563
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,151
Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to ask,
where are the hostages?

564
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,069
In there.

565
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,624
Oh, my God!!

566
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,869
That's like some son of zoo
from Planet Of The Apes.

567
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,539
Danny looks a bit.. bruised.

568
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,749
I lost my temper a couple of times.

569
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,669
- Three times.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was three.

570
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,887
Go and say hello.

571
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,890
- Give him a slap yourself, if you want.
- Oh, no..

572
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,761
No, I'll just..
I'll just say hello.

573
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,395
- Alan..
- Look, do the police know we're here?

574
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,184
Alan!! What the hell's going on?

575
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,025
Hey!! Hey, hey, hey!!

576
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,278
Cool it with the cross-talk,
you're professional broadcasters.

577
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,069
- I'm not, I'm a writer.
- We'll get through this with each other.

578
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:28,865
I want everyone to shake hands with everyone else.
Now!! Whether you want to or not.

579
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,907
This is ridiculous.

580
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,701
Ow.

581
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,911
Hello, er.. Connor.

582
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,257
- Paper.
- Hi.

583
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,420
OK. Pat will not communicate
directly with the police.

584
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,634
Only through me.

585
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,141
So as of now, I am bullhorn.

586
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,803
- But I think we're gonna be OK.
- OK? He hit me!!

587
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,644
Let's not get into who hit who or,
you know, who may have deserved it.

588
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,854
You need to keep him away from me.
Understand?

589
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,735
What I need to do, Danny,

590
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,108
in conjunction with Jason,
is crisis management.

591
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,432
I'm sure he'll agree
there has been plenty of crisis..

592
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,239
<b>- But no management.
- Cowabunga. Walk with me.</b>

593
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,455
Alan, you do realise
you're in the box seat here?

594
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,036
You've got the guy's confidence.

595
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,291
Yeah. I don't know why.

596
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,712
I go for a curry with him once a year,
and even then I don't have a starter.

597
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,122
Trouble is, he does.

598
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,256
All I need to know is can
you handle it?

599
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,792
Well, er..

600
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,586
Would you ask that of a man
who'd gone paint-balling,

601
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,927
realised he'd left his goggles at
reception but carried on anyway?

602
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,678
- Why?
- You're looking at him.

603
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,848
OK, guys,
quick wa-wa.

604
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,513
Just had a pow-wow with Jase,
upshot is..

605
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,274
I'm gonna be his right-hand
man on this one.

606
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:40,273
He'll be um.. my left-hand man.

607
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,771
<b>- Er..
- Sorry.</b>

608
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,657
The point is,
Pat has not gone mad.

609
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,701
He has a grievance.
He needs some son of outlet.

610
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:55,084
This is Pat Farrell, welcoming you to Roll
Out The Farrell on North Norfolk Digital.

611
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,627
OK. Pat may have..
may have gone mad.

612
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,834
He may have gone mad.

613
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,672
<b>And now we have a text from
Cynthia in Holt, who writes,</b>

614
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,551
<b>Dear Pat, we are sending you a bottle..</b>

615
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,972
<b>- Ma'am, you'd better listen to this.
- ..Of our homemade plum brandy.</b>

616
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,098
<b>We use it to make brandy butter..</b>

617
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,683
- Why am I listening to shit radio?
- That's Pat Farrell, ma'am.

618
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,437
He's broadcasting from the siege.

619
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,019
<b>Mm, yum, Cynthia.
Can't wait.</b>

620
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,943
Can you gently remind Pat
that we had an agreement?

621
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,070
You are there to communicate with us.

622
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:27,733
Listen, I don't know what it says
in your police operation manual..

623
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,618
- ..or in Psycho-babble Weekly.
- Penguin Book of Sieges.

624
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,742
or The Penguin Book of Sieges,

625
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,995
but out here in the field,
it's plenty different.

626
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:41,209
I've got a guy with a gun and a gripe
to grind, and he say, "No speaky."

627
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,375
I would really like to establish
a dialogue here, Alan.

628
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,715
A simple tri-lateral exchange,
from Pat, to you, to me, to you, to Pat.

629
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,847
- Do you understand?
- No more interruptions or else!!

630
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,680
You think I don't have balls?
I've got plenty of balls!!

631
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,311
I've got balls coming
out of my arse!!

632
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,853
- Er.. did you hear that?
- Yes.

633
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,270
<b>Well, that's.. that's the
end of the call. Bye.</b>

- Jason wanted them deleted.

00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,645
- He won't have deleted them all.
- He did delete them all.

640

- He did delete them all, Pat.
- What?

641
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,215
- It was jingle genocide.

00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:44,077
And if that jingle isn't word for word
what I just said,

664
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:48,715
I am going to shoot you in the feet,
then the knees, then the hands.

665
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,216
And basically anything you've
got two of, like your face.

666
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,177
Oh, yeah. Two-faced.

667
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,387
One hour.

668
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:05,850
One hour? This is impossible.
I'm gonna fucking die.

669
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,767
What are we gonna do?

670
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,902
You can't do a top-quality
jingle in an hour.

671
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,065
We can do this. Let me
tell you a story, um..

672
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,610
Back in the day, I was MC-ing a
conference for Reynard Pharmaceuticals.

673
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,321
Some of the marketing guys
were doing karaoke.

674
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,161
I didn't join in,
I tended to shun Japanese culture.

675
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,667
This was the mid-90s,
it was more acceptable.

676
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,921
But high on a cocktail of champagne
and cheap Fosters lager,

677
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,002
I lunged at the microphone.

678
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,418
A few minutes later,
I was making grown men cry

679
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,554
with my rendition of Summer Of '69
by Bryan Adams.

680
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,594
Thing is, I twisted the
lyrics to the Summer Of '29,

681
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,098
evoking memories of the Wall Street
Crash and German hyperinﬂation.

682
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,106
- Remember, these guys were in sales.
- Alan, where are you going with this?

683
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,608
The point is, he didn't think
he was any good at singing,

684
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,610
and it turns out he was quite good.

685
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,067
- Yeah, that.
- And that if you really, really try

686
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,697
- you can do anything.
- And that.

687
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,405
I don't care!! I'm going to fucking die!!

688
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,034
Hey, hey, I'm trying to save your head,
shoulders, knees and toes.

689
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,325
- Knees and toes.
- OK, man up, musos.

690
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,994
- I played synth in a jazz funk band.
- Great, who else?

691
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,128
I used to be the drummer
in Marillion.

692
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,381
Really? There's no time for that.

693
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,133
<b>- But wow and great.
- What are you gonna do first?</b>

694
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,385
I'm gonna lay down a rhythm track.

695
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,315
Oh.

696
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,148
Lynn Benfield?

697
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,154
<b>- I am she.
- Do you know Mr Alan Partridge?</b>

698
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,690
OK.

699
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,574
He wasn't stealing crisps.

700
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,031
He just gets ﬂustered at
self-service checkouts

701
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,822
- and takes things without scanning them.
- Miss Benfield..

702
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,913
He doesn't like being told to put things
in bagging areas by automated women.

703
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,670
No, Miss Benfield, we're here
because Mr Partridge is

704
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,668
currently involved in an armed siege.

705
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,758
- Oh.
- We're informing you as his next of kin.

706
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,175

Thanks for waiting, Miss Benfield.

723
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,152
We're speaking to anyone who can
help us build a picture of Pat Farrell.

724
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,908
- You said you know him?
- Ah, well..

725
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,615
I made three cakes for
him over the last year.

726
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,705
But there was nothing in them
that would have led him to do this.

727
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,038
- They were very plain.
- That's not one of our lines of investigation.

728
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,244
Just tell us what you know about Pat.

729
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,039
Irish. Shock of brown, curly hair.

730
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:20,176
He's a strong man, with strong arms
and a good walk. Moves well.

731
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,761
- That's very helpful, Lynn.
- Oh.

732
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,923
- Thank you.
- Now, how about some coffee?

733
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,057
Oh, of course. How do you take it?

734
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,436
No, no, we'll get it for you.
Just sit there, I'll be back.

735
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,267
Oh..

736
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,432
Wichita Lineman

737
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,484
I hate all this shit.
Telling us how to speak.

738
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,116
They think they're giving us
an identity but they're..

739
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,867
Turning us into nobodies.

740
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,154
We're just unit-shifters
for the money men.

741
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,197
Sounds quite good.

742
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,921
Alan, did you ever imagine
what life would be like in your 50s?

743
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,879
I had hopes and dreams.
I think we all did.

744
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,635
Penny for them.

745
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,217
Keep the penny,
you've got a gun.

746
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,975
But, yeah, I used to dream that one day
I'd drive a brand-new Range Rover

747
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,976
towing a speed boat.

748
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,309
I used to dream about growing old
with someone I love.

749
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,982
Hm. Both valid.

750
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,235
It's not gonna happen now, is it?

751
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,864
I miss my Molly so much.

752
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,999
- Who's this chap?
- That's Molly.

753
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,376
Yes, of course.

754
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,624
She's got such.. brown hair.

755
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,884
A year after that was
taken, the angels took her.

756
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,551
Must have been a few of them.

757
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,642
Now I've nobody.
No wife.

758
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,440
No family. No kids.

759
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,735
I've gotta say, Pat, kids
don't make you happy.

760
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,151
Some of the unhappiest times of my life
have been with my kids.

761
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,365
I remember..

762
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,407
a holiday on the
beach in Prestatyn.

763
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:18,287
The kids came over to me and said,
"Papa, Papa!! Follow me,"

764
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,547
and.. you know..

765
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,918
I followed them about 200 yards
across the sand dunes.

766
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:28,008
When I got there, finally,
all they'd done was dug a big hole.

767
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,390
Miserable.

768
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,604

Yeah. Or put on a compilation album if
you were tired or couldn't be bothered.

00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,066
Yeah.

796

was Molly's favourite too.

803
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,960
And Always On My Mind
was her favourite song.

804
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,888
Do you remember that?
The old road show bus.

805
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,303
Remember it? I took my
family camping in that.

806
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,437

- That was a tough nine days.

807

You see, this bus brought
joy to hundreds.

808
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,102
I wonder where it is now.

809
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,021
Probably impounded
after it crushed those scouts.

810
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,065

- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,430
Cuddle me, cop!!

832
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,272
Argh!!

833
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,058
Target down.

834
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,977
Yours, I believe.

835
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,737
You probably thought I was gay
when I gave you that cuddle.

836
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,273
Don't worry, I'm not.

837
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,942
- You're really cool, Alan.
- Yeah, we think you're cool.

838
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,862
Thank you. Sorry, who are you?

839
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,865
Jason Statham.

840
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,290
Jason Bourne.

841
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,543
Jason Argonaut.

842
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,584
- Jason Argonaut?
- Mm.

843
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,340
- It's Jason and the Argonauts.
- Yes.

844
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,671
Are you all right?

845
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:38,805
You just said, "clobber"
and then "Jason and the Argonauts".

846
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,933
- Oh, sorry.
- All right.

847
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,185
- We go?
- Yeah.

848
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,188
Oh, er.. by the way,
thanks for not taking the gun.

849
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,768
Oh.. that's fine.

It's taken from the

861
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,319
0100 hours. "Partridge:

862

I wish this was abroad because it would
make a brilliant Banged Up Abroad.

870

Just get to the bit where they stop
saying Banged Up Abroad.

871
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,174
I once banged up a broad.

872
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,469
That's the best you've got,
even with a gun to your head?"

873
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,979
He's got a gun to his head.

874
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,687
I remember once coming to
in a skip in the middle of the afternoon

875
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,476
with my underpants in my mouth.

876
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,528
"Oh, these are not my pants!!"

877
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,863
Oh, I can laugh about it now
but, you know, back then..

878
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:26,367

00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,039
It's the police.

If you like canapés that are on the
turn, we've hit the motherload.

882
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,174
Oblong plate, square bowl. Go figure.
Whatever happened to circles?

883
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,711
I mean I've heard of a square meal
but that's ridiculous.

884
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,921
I was just saying
I've heard of a square meal.

885
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,590
Alan!! Alan!! Ssh, ssh.

886
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,882
OK.

887
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,185
- We think it's the police.
- Wait.

888
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,805
- That definitely came from in there.
- That's just a cupboard.

889
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,690
- It's not even an outside wall.
- Careful.

890
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,227
- No, Jason..
- I'll protect you.

891
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,985
It's not an outside wall.
Look, I'll show you. Look.

892
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,992
- Michael?
- Aye, aye, Mister Partridge.

893
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,573
What are you hiding in there for?

894
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,864
I found myself a place of concealment,
like when I was on manoeuvres.

895
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,871
Take your light off.
You're blinding everyone you speak to.

896
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,501
- Now it's ﬂashing.
- Sorry.

897
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:19,257
Michael. You look like some
sort of big Geordie Anne Frank.

898
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,585
- How long have you been here?
- All night.

899
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,351
- What did you eat?
- I had me lunch box.

900
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,134
- Where did you go to the toilet?
- No.

901
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,173
I had me lunch box.

902
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,717
Thank God it's got a smoky finish
with an airtight seal.

903
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,768
I tell you what. It
seals in the freshness.

904
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,097
No, Michael. It seals out the freshness.

905
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,810
What is going on in here?

906
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,226
Michael's just visiting
us from the cupboard.

907
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,609
No need to get shouty-shouty.

908
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,066
Did those Goredale bastards
put you up to this?

909
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,903
<b>- No.
- No, no. I've been in here a few nights.</b>

910
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,783
- No, one night.
- No, a few nights.

911
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,785
A few nights this week
and the week before.

912
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,038
- Why?
- Me brother wanted the bed to himself.

913
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,120
Ah, yes.
Michael suffers from night terrors.

914
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,875
He thrashes about like a big salmon.

915
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,377
What's in the box?

916
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:00,127
Er.. Michael.. Michael
let himself down.

917
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,465
I'm really sorry.
I done a shit in the box.

918
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,722
Well, get rid of it.
Throw it out the window.

919
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,761
Fall back!! Fall back!!

920
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,852
Armed police!!

921
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,858
- Identify yourself!!
- Identify yourself!!

922
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,063
Alan Partridge.
Who the f.. Alan Partridge!!

923
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,778
You know who I am.
I haven't been off the TV that long.

924
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,069
- "Identify yourself."
- Alan, it's OK, I'm here. You're safe.

925
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,488
Yeah, tell them to stop
pointing their guns at me.

926
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,658
- Lower your weapons.
- Yeah, lower your weapons.

927
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,120
Take your hand off your gun.
Take your hand off your gun.

928
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,664
And the other hand.
I can wait here all day.

929
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,374
<b>Do as he says.</b>

930
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,135
Thank you. Why do you have to
turn it into a competition?

931
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,512
Just because I won. OK.

932
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,344
OK. Stop. Pat, stop tugging me.

933
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,349
I told you I've got a
very sensitive tummy.

934
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:53,680
Who are you talking to, Alan?

935
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,890
I've got Pat on the end of
the line in both senses.

936
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,772
I'm tethered to the building via
this rope and relaying messages

937
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:02,231
from Pat via this state-of-the-art
Sennheiser 1,000 head set.

938
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,441
Nice bit of kit. Yeah, I'm
telling them that now.

939
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,651
If you'd listened, you'd
know I'm telling them.

940
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,318
- Pat says “Hi".
- Hi, Pat.

941
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,578
And hi to your fellow officers.

942
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,163
Hi. Hi, Pat.

943
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:19,460
Alan, listen. Pat works with us here,
this can all end well. OK?

944
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,179
<b>- I give him my word.
- OK, just.. Yep.</b>

945
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,456
OK. Pat, you've got to..
you're rambling.

946
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,713
You've got to be more concise.
What do you want? “I want a helicopter."

947
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,011
That's just an example, by the way.

948
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,884
Yeah, OK. He wants a helicopter.

949
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,217
<b>That might not
be possible, Alan.</b>

950
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,057
<b>But let's dialogue.
What else can we do for him?</b>

951
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:47,066
Pat says, "Fucking stupid pigs.
What the hell's going on?"

952
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,199
Pat, listen to me. That
was not an attack, OK?

953
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,827
We just had to dispose of a box around
the corner in a controlled manner.

954
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,229
Pat would prefer it if you
spoke through me, as would I.

955
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,833
Marlin says they deployed
a remote RV fitted with a disruptor

956
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:04,122
to neutralise a suspected IED. He doesn't know
what you're talking about. He's quite angry.

957
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,258
He's honking in my ear
like a mad Irish goose.

958
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,293
- Aha!!
- We love you, Alan!!

959
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,929
Um.. do you mind? It's
not a radio road show.

960
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,512
<b>- I'm trying to host a siege here.
- We love you, Alan!!</b>

961
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,223
Get away. Who said that?

962
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,811
What's it like in there?

963
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,850
Ah.. scary, stressful, lots of shouting.

964
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,107
A bit like being married again.

965
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,026
And there's a crazy person
running around with a gun.

966
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,113
So it's a lot like being married again.

967
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:38,702
And er.. when I saw a guy with a shotgun
in his mouth begging for mercy then..

968
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,954
You're ahead of me.

969
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,596
You're ahead of me. A lot of you are.

970
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,542
He's still got his hand on his gun.
He thinks I don't know. Yeah, you.

971
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,957
- I'm looking at you. Peripheral vision.
- Alan.

972
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,467
I'm not retreating,
Pat's tugging me off.

973
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:51,843
No, come on.

974
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,630
- We're better than that. Guys, seriously.
- Alan, wait!!

975
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,641
By the way, there's an extra hostage.
Meant to tell you that.

<b>In a surprise development,

told me she never knew her mother, and I said,

"Well, my mother raised me

And then the next time -
surprise, surprise, my arse again.

1142
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,495
I was only telling people about you.

1146
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,877
You make friends with the bully
so they bully someone else.

01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:32,355
I want to, if you like,
lend my soul to Goredale Media

1151
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,152
on a long-term basis for cash.

1152
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,234
It's a very different thing.

1153
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,944
I don't know how
you can look yourself in the eye.

1154
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,613
I can't, Lynn. My nose is in the way.

1155
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,952
You can talk,
prattling away on every news bulletin.

1156
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,501
I mean, who the heck
do you think you are?

1157
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,623
- I'm Lynn Benfield.
- You don't look like Lynn Benfield.

1158
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:58,168
I mean, what has happened to you,
with your attitude and your hair?

1159
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,087
You've literally become a big head.

1160
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,719
- I like it.
- I take no pleasure in saying this, Lynn,

1161
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,177
but a lot of people think it looks
like a photograph of an explosion.

1162
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,596
I don't know if I want to
work for a man like you.

1165
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,484
I mean, one who lives in a terraced
house behind a train station.

1166
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,706
- Doors opening!!
- Armed police!! Armed police!!

1167
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,046
Oh, shut up, will you?
Stop shouting.

1168
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,509
- Easy, Pat. Mind the steps.
- I'm able to walk down steps, all right?

1169
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,718
He means because the gun's
against my head.

1170
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,852

- Hear, hear. Well said.

1171
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,100
- On.
- Hi, Pat.

1172
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,765
Hey, Alan. What happened?
We were in the middle of a show,

1173
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,809
and then your arse is all
over the internet.

1174
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,398
Looked like you had a turkey's head
between your legs.

1175
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,859
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
It doesn't have a beak.

1176
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,070
And, yeah, I took an executive decision

1177
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,656
to stow my cock and balls up
against my backside.

1178
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,158
I can't believe you left
me with this nutcase.

1179
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,289
Hang on a minute, you're
the one with the gun.

1180
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,076
- See? He's hilarious.
- He's solid. He's solid.

1181
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:17,623
- Pizzas coming through now, Pat.
- Hey. Hey, hey. Hold on. Helmet off.

1182
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,514
Oh, hello.

1183
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,428
Actually, I want Alan to bring them in.

1184
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,267
That might not be possible, Pat.
Alan's not prepared to do that.

1185
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,482
No.. I am prepared to do that.

1186
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,193
<b>- It's not that simple.
- Do you want me to release some people?</b>

1187
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,865
Sure. Let's talk about that.

1188
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,151
Alan, what do you reckon
if I let the women go?

1189
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,321
Yeah, let a couple of the women go.
Maybe keep Angela.

1190
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,498
<b>- But her kids will be worried sick.
- She's got kids?</b>

1191

Yeah. Two boys, 14 and 15.

1192
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,996
I believe they're a real handful.

1193

Alan, come on.

- OK, come on, son.

Oh, shit.

1199
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,526
Why did you say hello
to that delivery guy?

1200
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:26,445
Oh, him? No, he just reminded me
of a man I know called Mike Cable,

1201
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:30,704
who did my accounts from '97 to '98.

1202
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,614
Actually, no. '99.

1203
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,999
Till he stopped
because his daughter was very ill.

1204
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:36,910
Yeah, it was touch and go, actually.

1205
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,247
He and Sandra were in bits,
they had to cancel their holiday.

1206
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:43,000
- It was a ﬂy-drive to Tuscany.
- Hm.

1207
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,796
I must tell him, actually, that there's
a policeman that looks just like him.

1208
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,217
What's that?

1209
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:51,349
Must tell Mike that there's a pizza man
who looks just like him.

1210
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,682
I'm famished.

1211
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,432
- Ladies, you're free to go.
- What?

1212
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:01,814
- Yep.
- God bless you, Pat.

1213
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,102
See you. Bye.

1214
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,317
I'll make you a home-made pizza
when you get out.

1215

Yeah, these pizzas are pretty good.

1219

- Well, just give me that one.

Yeah, sure.
Just bringing the pizza cutter.

1229
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,923

Six or eight?

Oh, my God, that's a taser!!

1231
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,054
This is no use, it's a pizza cutter.
And that is not a pizza.

1232

Thing is, how did it get there?
Erm..

1233
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:19,146
Unless the pizza company are running
a competition in which you win a taser.

1234

01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:49,575
They may be small and strange-faced, but they
bring a lot of pleasure to a lot of people."

1471
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:53,033
Now, that's a letter, once upon a time
I would have found offensively dull.

1472
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,321
- Yeah.
- Not now.

1473
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,911
So maybe everything that happened
has changed you.

1474
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:58,792
I think I have changed a little bit.

1475
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:01,329
Well, for my part,
I was a bit worried about my head..

1476
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:02,712
- Here we go.
- But um..

1477
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:06,634
- I think I've got a handle on it now.
- Oh, yeah, that's a good joke.

1478
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,757
You've used that joke
about three or four times now.

1479
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,343
- I don't know if you're aware of that.
- I use it too much?

1480
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:16,010
I wouldn't say that. I just think
we're in that area and.. you know.

1481
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,178
- What about the hat?
- Good for the bin, I reckon.

1482
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,143
- Lose it?
- Yeah.

1483
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:23,058
But I think, like you say,
you're coming on leaps and bounds..

1484
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,568
and I think, 12 months' time,

1485
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,229
you'll probably have forgotten
there ever was a siege.

1486
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:29,569
- What siege?
- Er.. exactly. That's good.

1487
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,075
- You haven't really forgotten?
- No.

1488
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:36,955
OK, time now for our weekly phone call
with incarcerated DJ Pat Farrell.

a dental hygienist from Grantham.

1493
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:52,179
She asks, "Prison time is
often referred to as porridge

1494
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:57,389
but do they actually serve porridge,
and if so, is it compulsory?"

1495

<b>Yeah, they serve porridge
but you can have other things.</b>
