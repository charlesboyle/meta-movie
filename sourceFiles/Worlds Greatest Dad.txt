1
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:31,534
My name is Lance Clayton.

2
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:34,768
My biggest fear in life is that
I'm going to end up all alone.

3
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,334
I'm a writer.

4
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:40,067
I'm a writer, but so far
nothing I've written

5
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:42,601
Has ever been published.

6
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,100
Ernest Hemingway once said

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,634
All he wanted to do was
write one true sentence.

8
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:50,167
He also tried to scratch an
itch on the back of his head

9
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,667
With a shotgun.

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,467
I've always dreamed of
being a famous author,

11
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:00,834
of creating an important work...

12
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,801
¶ ooh la la la la la la la ¶

13
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:05,401
¶ la la la la la la

14
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:07,000
¶ saa la la la la la la la... ¶

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,667
...something that connected
with people and helped them

16
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,900
As they suffered through
the human condition.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,401
¶ ooh la la la...

18
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:16,267
also something that made
a shitload of cash.

19
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,401
¶ ooh la la la la la...

20
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:28,467
I've written novels, books,
magazine articles,

21
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,267
And even children's stories.

22
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:33,367
All have been rejected.

23
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:36,701
I did sell a few greeting
cards once, though.

24
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:40,067
It felt pretty good.

25
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,601
I don't find the creative process

26
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,900
In itself rewarding enough.

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,967
I have to be honest--
I want to reach an audience.

28
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,467
This is my fifth novel.

29
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:53,667
I've promised myself that
if this one is rejected,

30
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,267
I'll give up writing.

31
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:10,167
Come on, boy, we're late.

32
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,167
Hey, buddy, I--

33
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,701
Kyle?

34
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,900
Oh, fuc--
What the fuck?

35
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,967
- God! Kyle?
- D-Dad?

36
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,134
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

37
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:26,601
- God, I was coming, you fag!
- Jesus Christ.

38
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,868
- I thought you were dead.
- Do you knock? Please!

39
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:30,567
I knocked.
Okay, yep.

40
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,634
- Out!
- God, I--

41
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:34,634
- Get out of my room!
- I'm out. I'm going.

42
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,734
- I'm out of here.
- You ever heard of privacy?

43
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:38,601
- You freak!
- Yeah, I'm the weird one.

44
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,634
Yeah. Oh, god.

45
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:42,801
what the fuck?

46
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,933
Dad?

47
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,868
Dad?

48
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:58,234
- Dad!
- Oh, yeah. Right.

49
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:05,534
¶ what do you do? Where do you go? ¶

50
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,868
You were up early.

51
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:16,067
- You're not funny.
- Okay.

52
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,000
What a Monday.

53
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:22,300
¶ Somewhere else...

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,601
why are we
listening to this?

55
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,534
'Cause I like
Bruce Hornsby.

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,667
Stop it.

57
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,933
Bruce Hornsby is a fag.

58
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,667
He's got kids, Kyle.

59
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,634
- You have a kid.
- Mmm.

60
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:46,134
- And you're a fag.
- Why? Because I like Bruce Hornsby?

61
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:48,200
- Yeah.
- Well, put on some music you like. Okay?

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,701
No, I fucking hate music.

63
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,200
- You hate music?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,634
- All music?
- Yes.

65
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,768
The only thing queerer than
music are the people who like it.

66
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:59,434
All music is gay now?
What about heavy metal?

67
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:03,467
That's probably the faggiest
of all the fag music out there.

68
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,601
Kyle, you could have
died this morning.

69
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:08,634
Well...
of embarrassment.

70
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,634
What you're doing
is dangerous.

71
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,768
What? Beating off?

72
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:15,601
No no-- Not--
We all have needs, Kyle.

73
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,200
Needs? What-- What are you
talking about?

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,701
Masturbation is natural, okay?

75
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,300
- You know what's not natural?
- What?

76
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,234
Talking about jerking off with your dad,
that's not natural.

77
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:24,734
- Shit.
- Don't do that, please, okay?

78
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:27,067
- Why?
- Because your feet are dirty.

79
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,601
Because I said so.

80
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,434
- Whoa, let me out here.
- Let me park in the lot.

81
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:46,734
Lance, I'm gonna look like a
dillweed walking in with you, all right?

82
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:48,534
It's bad for my rep.

83
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,134
Don't call me Lance.

84
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:53,067
It's your name,
isn't it? Lance?

85
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,501
¶ what do you do?
Where do you go? ¶

86
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:58,834
¶ what do you say?

87
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,467
¶ and how do you know?

88
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,868
¶ I'll say who cares ¶

89
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,868
¶ when people stare

90
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:10,200
¶ I will make myself
invisible ¶

91
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,734
¶ yes, I will,
yes, I will ¶

92
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:16,134
¶ Mm-Hmm

93
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:18,267
¶ Mm-Hmm

94
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,234
¶ Mm-Hmm hmm...

95
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,501
slow down, boys.

96
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,000
¶ When I feel
like a freak... ¶

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,768
'Morning.

98
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:31,467
¶ When I'm on the other end
of someone's mean streak ¶

99
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:34,933
¶ people make fun,
I've got to lose myself... ¶

100
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,434
Danny.

101
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:40,367
¶ Take my thin skin and
move it somewhere else ¶

102
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:44,033
¶ I'm setting myself up
for the future ¶

103
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:48,900
¶ looking for the chance that
something good might lie ahead ¶

104
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:53,367
¶ I guess I'm looking for
the possibilities ¶

105
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,900
¶ and in my mind

106
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,134
¶ I've got this skin
I can shed... ¶

107
00:05:58,134 --> 00:05:59,801
¶ what do you do?

108
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:01,300
¶ Where do you go?...

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,734
- Good morning, Lance.
- 'Morning principal Anderson.

110
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,634
- What was that?
- Oh, personal mail,

111
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:07,267
But I used my own postage.

112
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,534
- Mmm. Good.
- Right.

113
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:11,467
May I speak with you
for a moment?

114
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,234
Sure.

115
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,634
Your poetry course,

116
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:17,434
It's not very popular.

117
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:20,033
- Neither is poetry, sir.
- Mmm.

118
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:22,234
But the few who take it,
they get a lot out of it.

119
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:24,200
Yes yes,
I'm sure they do.

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,467
But I am sorry--
If your class enrolment

121
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:29,234
Doesn't improve by next semester,
we're going to have to drop it.

122
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,701
We're only budgeted for
one English elective,

123
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:35,267
And Mike Lane's Creative-Writing
course is quite the hit.

124
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,401
I just wanted to give you
a heads up.

125
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, thank you, sir.

126
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,200
- Hey, what's going on, Mr. L?
- Hey, how you doin', man?

127
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,734
- Good. How are you?
- Ready for tonight's game?

128
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:47,234
- Yeah, you gonna be there?
- I'll be there. Of course.

129
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,933
- Good.
- Throw a touchdown for me, all right?

130
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,933
- Of course!
- Hey, Lancelot!

131
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,734
- What's up, buddy?
- Not much, Mike.

132
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,868
All right.

133
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,900
'Morning, Miss. Reed.

134
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,000
- Hello, Mr. Clayton.
- How are you?

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,033
- Good. How are you?
- Mmm.

136
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:06,467
Ahh, my favorite.

137
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,467
I thought teachers weren't
supposed to have favorites.

138
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,134
Not favorite students.

139
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,334
I'm a lucky guy.

140
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:20,434
How does a lump like me
get a dame like you?

141
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:22,667
Don't insult my taste.
I'm the lucky guy.

142
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,834
You finished?

143
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,434
Yeah. I wanted you to be
the first to read it.

144
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:31,601
I'm honored.

145
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:32,900
Really?

146
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,300
Maybe I'll take you
someplace fancy for dinner.

147
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
How about you come over to
my place for something hot and spicy?

148
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,900
Is that a double entendre?

149
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,933
- No, I was just going to make you my chilli.
- Oh.

150
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,300
And then bang you.

151
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,567
Great!

152
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,634
You have a very professional day,
Miss. Reed.

153
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,067
Right back at you,
Mr. Clayton.

154
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,967
- Take care.
- Extremely professional day.

155
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:57,567
Andrew, I want to show you something.

156
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:00,067
What is it?

157
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,267
Ew, is that woman
being crapped on?

158
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:04,734
Happy birthday.
It's fucking German Schizer porn.

159
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,933
All right, dude? It's fucking hot,
right, yo?

160
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,567
No, dude, what the fuck
is wrong with you, yo?

161
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,167
Nothing.

162
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,701
You wouldn't say that if
you lived in Europe.

163
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,033
I mean, these Europeans are much more
broadminded than these uptight Americans.

164
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,868
Shit's huge in Germany.

165
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:21,801
Yeah, well, we're not in Europe
and I don't like that kind of stuff.

166
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,067
Yeah, I know,
that's 'cause you're a fag.

167
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,900
Dude, it's gross.

168
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,200
I'd do it...

169
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,701
do someone.

170
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,401
- Oh.
- I would.

171
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:33,601
I'd chilli-dog her.

172
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,467
Hi, Jennifer.

173
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,701
Come on, baby, that pussy's
not gonna eat itself.

174
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,734
What the fuck did you just say?

175
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:45,134
Uh, nothing.

176
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,667
You're a fucking pig.

177
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,701
Wow, okay.

178
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,567
Hold that.

179
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,967
Get off me, you dumb jock!

180
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:06,200
What are you talking about?
I don't even play sports.

181
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,801
- You--
- Hey!

182
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,933
Come on, guys, knock it off.
Knock it off.

183
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,467
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

184
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:17,200
Oh, you're gonna help me up?

185
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,000
- Come on.
- Can't you control that animal?

186
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,667
Now come on, tough guy,
let's go.

187
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,467
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

188
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,801
Kyle,

189
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:32,467
What did you say to Jennifer?

190
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,501
Nothing.

191
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,801
He said that her pussy
is not going to eat itself.

192
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,501
Do you hear that?

193
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,434
You are--
That is rude.

194
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:44,267
- And you're a pervert.
- Be quiet.

195
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,100
Kyle, is that what you said?

196
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,667
No.

197
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,000
Jennifer, Chris, get back to class.

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,634
Kyle, I need to speak
with you and your father.

199
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,434
Kyle,

200
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,467
Right now you're
on academic probation

201
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,801
And your grades show no
sign of improvement.

202
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,401
If you don't straighten up,

203
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,601
I'm going to have to expel you.

204
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:15,933
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Mr. Anderson.

205
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:18,267
I do understand.

206
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:21,634
Now get out of here.
And no more trouble.

207
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:23,900
Wait for me outside.

208
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,167
Lance,

209
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,167
This isn't easy for me.

210
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,033
What isn't easy, Mr. Anderson?

211
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,768
How's Kyle been acting
at home?

212
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:41,900
I mean, does he seem
normal to you?

213
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Oh, yeah.

214
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,534
Oh. You and I both know
that sometimes

215
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:50,100
These things take
a long time to surface.

216
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,900
What things?

217
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,567
Well, I think that Kyle's
poor grades and acting out

218
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,701
Show signs of a serious
development problem.

219
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,768
He belongs in
a special-needs school

220
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,501
Where he can get the proper attention
and care that he requires.

221
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:03,167
- What?
- That's nothing to be ashamed of.

222
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,167
Sir, he's--
He's not slow.

223
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,734
He's just being a pain.

224
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,267
Give him
another chance.

225
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:12,033
Well, I have.
I've given him many chances.

226
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:14,300
That's true.

227
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,567
All right.

228
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:29,634
All right, but he'd better start
showing signs of improvement

229
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:33,000
And quickly. And he's got to stop
disturbing the other students.

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,334
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

231
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:37,033
Thank you.

232
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,900
- You're grounded.
- I'll run away.

233
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,534
Oh, and live with your mother?

234
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,234
And her boy-toy Todd?
That's a great idea.

235
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:45,933
- I'll take away your computer.
- No, you won't.

236
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,200
Yes, I will.
Jesus Christ, Kyle,

237
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,334
What did I do
to deserve this?

238
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,267
I didn't ask to be born.

239
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:55,033
Neither did l.

240
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,734
Boo hoo.

241
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:00,534
You are so funny!

242
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:03,067
Wait, read from here.
Starting there.

243
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,334
- What are you reading?
- "We don't experience it

244
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:06,734
As a restriction!"

245
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:10,234
- What's that?
- Oh, god, you are so funny.

246
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:12,234
It's-- Come here.
Give it to me.

247
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,467
- Oh, this is embarrassing.
- Mike got published

248
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,401
- In "The New Yorker."
- "New Yorker"!

249
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,000
- Hello!
- "The New Yorker"?

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,434
It's about the first robot that joins the N.B.A.

251
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:23,467
- It's like a parody about racism.
- MISS. REED: Racism.

252
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,634
- It's hysterical.
- No, it isn't.

253
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:28,267
No, it is seriously so good.

254
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,300
Called "I, forward."
Get it?

255
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,634
Yeah, like "I, robot."

256
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:34,467
- Right, but "I, forward."
- Yeah.

257
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,667
It's-- It's really hard
getting in "The New Yorker."

258
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,067
- It is?
- Yeah, really.

259
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,601
It's the first thing I submitted.

260
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:41,367
that's amaz--
I'm amazed.

261
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,534
The first thing?
No.

262
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:45,900
That's great.
Good for you.

263
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,567
- What's that?
- Mike got published in "The New Yorker."

264
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,367
You don't say!
May I see it?

265
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,234
- Sure.
- It's about racism.

266
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:55,000
Hot dog!
Now don't go getting too famous on us.

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,768
What's that?

268
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:58,567
Mike published an article
in "The New Yorker."

269
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,734
- Take a look at that.
- Ho ho!

270
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:03,334
Right on.
You dog, you dog!

271
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,567
Yeah!

272
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,367
This should be read at assembly.

273
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,868
Now that is a great idea.

274
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:10,734
Mike, would you read it
at the assembly?

275
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,634
If you twist my arm,
all right.

276
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,334
May I take this with me?

277
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,000
- Yeah, sure.
- Can I read it after him?

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,467
That's awesome.
Congratulations.

279
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:20,134
Hey, blow my whistle.
Come on-- "The New Yorker"!

280
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,367
For "The New Yorker"!
Yeah!

281
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:28,401
Wow, I cannot wait
to get my own copy.

282
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,667
"New Yorker."
It's not a national,

283
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:35,300
- But that's amazing.
- No.

284
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,401
Actually, it is
a national magazine.

285
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,900
- It's national.
- Really?

286
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,734
Whoa, I didn't know that.

287
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:41,900
Mmm.

288
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,134
How's Kyle?

289
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:45,134
Great.

290
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:47,534
Raising a son
is so hard.

291
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:50,567
Don't get me wrong, my hunter is the
best thing that ever happened to me.

292
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,734
But man, can he be a handful.

293
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:54,967
- How old is he?
- Two, going on 20.

294
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,601
Oh, god.

295
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:57,868
The kid's a player.

296
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:59,501
Well, I wonder where
he gets that from.

297
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,434
I have no idea.

298
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,701
How's he dealing with
the separation?

299
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,601
Real well.

300
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:08,100
I didn't know
you were separated.

301
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,167
Yeah.
It's been tough,

302
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:13,834
But his mother and I were supposed
to make a baby together.

303
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,134
We just weren't supposed
to live together.

304
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:18,300
- That's so sad.
- Yeah.

305
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,534
Thanks.

306
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:23,200
How often
do you see him?

307
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,067
Every other weekend.

308
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:28,167
They're not kidding when
they say that raising a child

309
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,900
Is the toughest job
you'll ever love.

310
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,567
Mmm. Well, you sound
like a great dad.

311
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,967
Ah, well,

312
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,000
I try my best.

313
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,100
Hi, Andrew.

314
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,801
Hey.

315
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,033
I enjoy our little chats.

316
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,567
oh, yeah.

317
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,000
- Kyle?
- Hi-- Hi, dad.

318
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,567
- What are you doing?
- What? Nothing.

319
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,267
What's Andrew doing here?

320
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:09,367
What, Andr-- Don't
bother Andrew, all right?

321
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,167
- He has asthma.
- Then he shouldn't be having milk products.

322
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,334
- What?
- Listen, you're grounded. Send him home.

323
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:18,234
I can't send him home, dad!

324
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,967
God, man, you never listen to me.

325
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,734
I told you, he doesn't have a father

326
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:23,467
And he has a mother
who's an alcoholic.

327
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,300
Kyle, send him home.
You don't get to have friends over.

328
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,334
Fine, you know what?
You can send him home.

329
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,401
I'm not gonna do that to this guy.

330
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,933
Okay? You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

331
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,601
- Kyle?
- You're so-- What?

332
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,567
- What do you want?
- Do you want to do some homework?

333
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,634
I would love to, but I can't.

334
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:40,267
You have to go home.

335
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,801
Why?

336
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,667
Oh, well, that's a question
for my father.

337
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,734
Fine, Andrew can stay.
You can do homework.

338
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,100
Oh, you can stay now!
You can--

339
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,567
Go on, get in.
Shut up.

340
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,467
Oh, you're gonna tell me
to shut up now.

341
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,167
- Yeah, I am.
- Prick.

342
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Mr. Clayton, do you
have anything to eat?

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,601
Sure, Andrew.

344
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,933
Uh, I'm a vegetarian.

345
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,601
Here you go, Andrew.
It's just cheese.

346
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,100
I hope you're okay
with that.

347
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,900
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Thanks, Mr. Clayton.

348
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,434
Kyle, let's see
how much you've got here.

349
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:17,067
On, online.
Well, "farmers relied on good soil,

350
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,434
worker animals, sunshine and...

351
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:20,868
perspiration."

352
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:22,434
You mean like sweat?

353
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:25,134
No, perspiration--
When it rains!

354
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,267
Uh, that's--
That's precipitation.

355
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,334
No, I meant "sweat."

356
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:30,634
Oh.

357
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:33,067
It's hot. You want
something to drink, Andrew?

358
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,200
No.

359
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,467
You okay?

360
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm trying to write.

361
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,667
- Sorry.
- Please.

362
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,667
Hello?

363
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,067
- Hey.
- Hi.

364
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,367
As soon as I finish helping
Kyle with his homework,

365
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,667
I'm coming over to your house and
putting my penis in your vagina.

366
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's a single entendre.

367
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh, I should have
called you earlier.

368
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,401
I didn't get to the store
so I didn't make chilli.

369
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:58,067
Oh. Well, I'll
take you out to dinner.

370
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,768
Oh, I don't know if
that's a good idea.

371
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,768
I mean, we really shouldn't go out
where students might see us.

372
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:04,701
Well, you know what?
I'll pick up some takeout and bring it over.

373
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:08,900
Oh, would you just hate me if we
did this tomorrow night instead?

374
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,801
I'm just not feeling that great,
and it's already kind of late.

375
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:15,567
No. No, tomorrow night'll be great.

376
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,768
Okay.

377
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:18,900
Are you sure you're
not mad at me?

378
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,834
No, not at all.

379
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,067
Okay.

380
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,701
Then good night, sugar.

381
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:24,834
Good night, popsicle.

382
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,501
Let's see how you're doing
on that report, huh?

383
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:40,067
- It's good.
- Yeah.

384
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,734
See, Kyle?

385
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,467
What are you doing?

386
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:45,501
- Cool down.
- Oh.

387
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:47,634
What time do you
have to be home, Andrew?

388
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:48,834
It doesn't matter.

389
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,567
Well, you know, it's just 9:30.

390
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,734
We can go to a video store,
get a movie.

391
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:55,801
Are you stupid?
I hate watching movies.

392
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,834
You used to like watching
movies when you were a kid.

393
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,834
Yeah, only 'cause
you wanted me to.

394
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:02,267
Movies are for losers
and art fags.

395
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:05,067
Oh.
What would you like to do?

396
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,434
Um...

397
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:10,234
can Andrew and I play "Doom"
on my computer?

398
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,267
Yeah.

399
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,200
Just "Doom,"
nothing else.

400
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,167
I like your dad.

401
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,534
My dad?

402
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,367
He's a fucking idiot.

403
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:28,801
"Insanity laughs

404
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:32,367
under pressure we're cracking

405
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:36,200
can't we give ourselves
one more chance?

406
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,067
why can't we give love

407
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,000
one more chance?

408
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,100
why can't we give love

409
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,601
give love

410
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,167
give love..."

411
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,801
Stop.

412
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:54,801
Jason, you didn't
write that.

413
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,933
"Under Pressure."

414
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,801
What were you thinking?

415
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:02,033
I didn't think
you knew that one.

416
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,933
Jason, I'm white.

417
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:05,601
- Oh, boy.
- Sit down.

418
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:06,967
Thank you.

419
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:11,868
Guys, why are you here if
you're not gonna even try?

420
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:15,033
Poetry is about saying
something from your heart,

421
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,734
Something personal.
Okay?

422
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes, Ginger?

423
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,734
I have something
that's kind of personal.

424
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:23,467
Great. Go ahead.

425
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,601
"It was raining yesterday afternoon

426
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:38,367
water dripping off the lilac
bushes my mother loves

427
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,234
and as I sat and watched the blood
pour out from between my legs

428
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:44,667
and felt the pain of motherhood myself

429
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,601
I wondered if it would have
been a boy or a girl"

430
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:54,768
Thank you.

431
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,768
That was very personal.

432
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,834
Thanks.

433
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,567
If you ever need to talk
to someone, I'm here.

434
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:08,167
Why?

435
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:12,900
¶ yes, it's a good day ¶

Hello, lamb chop.

446
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,501
Hello, honeydew melon.

447
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:35,200
What's wrong?

448
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,634
Nothing.

449
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,234
Something's bothering you.

450
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,667
Do you like Mike?

451
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,768
What are you talking about?

452
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,667
Don't get mad. I mean,
I know we've never talked

453
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,933
About not seeing
anyone else.

454
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:49,601
I'm sorry I said that.

455
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,900
I--

456
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:54,868
Are we still on for dinner?

457
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:58,734
¶ I've got a gal

- MISS. REED: Hello, jerk.

469
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,467
I am so sorry.

470
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,267
Yeah, you're a real shitbird.

471
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,768
Don't let it happen again.

472
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:46,801
I am such a jerk.

473
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,933
And it will never happen again.

474
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,834
¶ Mmm, a woman
is a creature... ¶

475
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,267
- Hello?
- In here!

476
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:58,601
¶ that has always
been strange ¶

477
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,033

00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:05,167
¶ you find she's gone
and made a change... ¶

479
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,100
Oh, great.
Thanks.

480
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,734
¶ is you is or
is you ain't... ¶

481
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,134
That's great.

482
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:11,768
It's an interesting piece.

483
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:14,234
- Yeah? You're an interesting piece.
- Oh!

484
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,601
This is just like high school, right?

485
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:25,367
Ah. Except I didn't have
any girlfriends in high school.

486
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,367
Oh, well, those girls were idiots.

487
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,134
I would have been your girlfriend.

488
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:30,601
Oh.

489
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,501
If we had a time machine,

490
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,200
Let's see--

491
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,534
Mmm...

492
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:38,200
I'd be in high school
and you'd be a fetus.

493
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,134
- I think that's--
- No, that's not cool.

494
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:41,467
No, not cool.

495
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:44,601
Ala la la la.

496
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:45,900
Weekend Summary:

497
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,067
We did nothing,
followed by nothing,

498
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,000
With a grand finale of nothing.

499
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,634
About time, Felter.

500
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:55,000
I think they're doing it.

501
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,534
What?

502
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:59,033
You-- You think that they're fucking?

503
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:00,667
Andrew, Andrew, look,

504
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,200
You have to know that fucking
pussy is virgin shit, all right?

505
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,634
When I'm with a bitch, I just go
straight for the brown-eye.

506
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,634
What?

507
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:08,801
I stick my cock in her asshole.

508
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:11,933
I got that part, but you've
never been with a woman.

509
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,234
Fuck you.

510
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:14,734
Kyle, I'm always with you.
I know.

511
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,334
No, you're not
always with me.

512
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:17,601
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

513
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,768
Loser.

514
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,801
Oh, you're fucking fucked!

515
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:26,033
- You're fucking--
- Let it go, Kyle. They're not worth it.

516
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:28,701
"Aha," yeah. That's right,
laugh it up, you fucking whores.

517
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:36,701
don't be shy.

518
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:39,033
There you go.

519
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:41,501
Ahh, yeah.

520
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:43,534
Oh.

521
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:45,134
hey, buddy, what you doin'?

522
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:47,734
I'm doing my homework.
What does it look like I'm doing?

523
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:48,667
Oh.

524
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,267
What?

525
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:54,801
Nothing.
Need a hand?

526
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,501
You know,
your report, or...

527
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,868
no. No, it's-- No.

528
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:02,267
Okay.

529
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,100
Hey, listen, I'm going
on a date tonight.

530
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
And if you're hungry, I could
fix you some food before I go.

531
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
You're going on a date
with who?

532
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,834
Well, no one's
supposed to know

533
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,967
Because it could cause
problems at school.

534
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:15,467
Claire.

535
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,634
Claire?

536
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,334
Do I know this Claire?

537
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,401
Miss. Reed. Hmm?

538
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:24,768
Really? You're going out
with the T.I.L.F, that's great.

539
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:26,200
- The what?
- T.I.L.F.--

540
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,601
- "Teacher I'd like to fuck."
- Nice mouth.

541
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,933
Hey, it's just what the other
kids at school call her.

542
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,701
What do you think
about Miss. Reed?

543
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:35,900
Well, she's got a hot body,
helmet's okay.

544
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,267
- Do her from behind.
- Hey, come on now!

545
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:40,501
Kyle, when did you become
such a pervert?

546
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:42,000
You sound like
your uncle Pete.

547
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,567
There's more to
a woman than that.

548
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,134
What do you think about
her personality?

549
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:48,367
Oh, um, nah.

550
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,701
She's pretty stuck up
and she's a phony.

551
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:53,401
Why do I even
tell you these things?

552
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,300
- Hello?
- Hey.

553
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,367
- Hi.
- We still on for some vittles?

554
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,601
Oh, I'm so sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

555
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:11,701
My mother is having
a nervous breakdown.

556
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:15,167
Her dog got burnt
by a hair crimper.

557
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:18,334
They were playing fetch or something--
She's fucking bananas.

558
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:19,501
Ahh.

559
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:21,667
I'm so sorry about tonight.

560
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,300
You're not mad,
are you?

561
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,601
Mmm, not at all.

562
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:27,401
Okay, good night, cupcakes.

563
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,367
Good night,
watermelon sherbet.

564
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:41,200
¶ when I get high

565
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,634
¶ this world's so nice ¶

566
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:49,434
¶ when I get high

567
00:25:49,434 --> 00:25:53,200
¶ it's paradise... ¶

568
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,367
Your pot smells like shit.

569
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:01,267
- Oh. Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

570
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,768
- Would you like some?
- Are you kidding?

571
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:06,534
I can barely breathe.

572
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:08,567
Oh, I'm really sorry.
Oh.

573
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,267
However,

574
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,834
If you were to offer me
some pot brownies,

575
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,334
I wouldn't say no.

576
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

577
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,401
Tonight when you're
getting changed,

578
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:26,067
Would you mind pulling
your bedroom drapes?

579
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,667
Why?

580
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,801
I think my son watches you.

581
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,334
Get out of here.

582
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:34,267
No no. I think he watches
you change.

583
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:36,267
Your son?

584
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:37,501
Mm-Hmm.

585
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,134
I thought he was a zombie.

586
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:40,933
I wish. I like zombies.

587
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,300
Oh, yeah, you do?
Me too. I do.

588
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,834
- Really?
- Yeah.

589
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:47,100
Oh, I like the early zombie movies like
"Night Of The Living Dead."

590
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,634
Me too.

591
00:26:48,634 --> 00:26:50,634
Oh, yeah, don't watch
that one alone.

592
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:52,334
- I don't like the new ones.
- No.

593
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:54,834
- Zombies are too fast, you know?
- Yeah, too fast. Yeah.

594
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:57,933
I believe like Simon Pegg said,
"The death is an impediment,

595
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,401
not an energy drink."

596
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:26,067
What you doing?

597
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,933
Jesus, dad.
You almost made me crap.

598
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:32,467
Did you get your homework done?

599
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,467
Yeah, a long time ago.

600
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:35,634
Yeah.

601
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,067
- Yeah.
- What--

602
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,100
Are you stoned?

603
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,467
No.

604
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:44,000
Seriously, you smell like pot.
Are you smoking pot?

605
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,834
- No.
- You can tell me.

606
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:48,267
- No.
- You're not using grass?

607
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,768
No, you don't use grass.
No.

608
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:52,768
Then what's--
What's that smell?

609
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:54,334
What smell?

610
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:57,267
It's probably a skunk outside
or something, you know.

611
00:27:57,267 --> 00:27:58,868
Oh yeah, sure, a skunk.

612
00:27:58,868 --> 00:28:00,401
Hey, you know what?

613
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:02,634
Why don't we do something
together tomorrow?

614
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:04,434
Why?
'Cause you feel bad?

615
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,234
Yeah. No.

616
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:09,868
I mean, it'd be just fun to do
something together, you know?

617
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:11,100
- Okay.
- Mmm.

618
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,401
Yeah. Yeah,
like build a rocket.

619
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,100
Sure, if you want to.

620
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,134
That's retarded.

621
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:18,868
Yeah.

622
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:20,467
Yeah.

623
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,300
- What do you want to do?
- Nothing.

624
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,967
Oh, come on now, Kyle, you must
be passionate about something.

625
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:27,534
- You want to know what I like?
- Yeah.

626
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:29,234
- I like looking at vaginas...
- Ahh.

627
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:30,467
...all day long.

628
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:35,601
- There you go.
- Yeah.

629
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:39,300
But maybe do something
non-vagina related.

630
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,100
You know, outside the vagina.

631
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,501
Okay, uh,
we could go to the mall.

632
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:47,834
Okay. And then
we'll catch a movie.

633
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:50,167
Yeah, sure,
at the mall, you know?

634
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:53,167
And then we'll maybe
look for a new computer.

635
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:54,768
No no, we'll just hang.

636
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:57,300
Dad, did I tell you that
we had to buy a new computer?

637
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,701
No, I said-- If you
were listening to me--

638
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,834
That we could look
for a new computer, okay?

639
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:04,100
And then we'll go
to your movie.

640
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,234
Okay. But we're not
buying a new computer.

641
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:09,434
Yeah, all right.
Sounds fun.

642
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:11,234
This isn't the biggest screen.

643
00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:13,100
Jesus Christ,
how about a "Thank You"?

644
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,667
Are you on your period
or something?

645
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,100
Can I not say anything?

646
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,868
Hey, isn't that-- Isn't that
Mike with Miss. Reed?

647
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:24,300
Yeah, it is.

648
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,868
Dude, I wouldn't let
my bitch treat me that way.

649
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:28,534
- You don't have a "Bitch."
- How do you know?

650
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,401
- Hi, Kyle.
- Hey.

651
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,300
- Mr. Clayton.
- Hello, Andrew.

652
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,167
Oh, wow, so he
got it for you.

653
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:37,801
- Sweet.
- Not that sweet. It's not the biggest one.

654
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:41,167
What-- Dad, we're gonna
go home and hook this up.

655
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,534
What about going to
the movies?

656
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:44,868
Dad, we'll go
to dinner later!

657
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,701
Okay, fine.

658
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,100
Uh, what are you gonna do,
Mr. Clayton?

659
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,634
Oh, probably go to the movies
by myself, Andrew.

660
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:54,501
Andrew!

661
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,667
What are you doing?

662
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,501
You're carrying that
the rest of the way.

663
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:02,300
What, are you gonna cry?

664
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,801
Fucking pussy.

665
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,367
God damn it.

666
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:22,567
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

667
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:25,167
What did you do today?

668
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:28,634
I was with Mike. He was having
a breakdown about his divorce.

669
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:31,067
He was depressed 'cause
he had to go to this wedding,

670
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:34,634
So I went with him to the mall and
helped him pick up a suit to wear.

671
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,667
I know,
I saw you two there.

672
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:39,134
You did?
Why didn't you say hi?

673
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:42,567
I don't know.
It seemed weird.

674
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,734
Does it bother you
that I have male friends?

675
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:47,634
No, it bothers me you keep
our relationship secret

676
00:30:47,634 --> 00:30:49,501
And you're out
in public with him.

677
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,667
Okay. What are you
doing tonight, hmm?

678
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,401
Let's go out.
We'll go out someplace fancy,

679
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:57,334
Someplace the world
can see us.

680
00:30:57,334 --> 00:31:00,367
How about
outback steakhouse?

681
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,667
Oh.

682
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,634
Anyone who's anybody
will be there.

683
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:06,567
You know, we can have
Aussietizers...

684
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,933
you know, wait, I can't.
I promised Kyle I'd take him out.

685
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,501
Let me take
both of you out.

686
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:13,501
- It'll be my treat.
- Really?

687
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:17,067
Oh.
That's so nice.

688
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:23,367
- Hey, Kyle.
- I'm in here.

689
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:27,200
Why do you always
tip over this photo?

690
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,868
'Cause I hate it.
I look inbred.

691
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,167
I think you look handsome.

692
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,234
We're going out to dinner
tonight with Claire.

693
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:35,100
What? No.

694
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,567
- No, we're not.
- Oh, come on.

695
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:38,501
I thought she was
seeing Mr. Lane.

696
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:41,200
No no, they're just friends and she's
trying to help him out through a tough time.

697
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,801
Why am I explaining
this to you, Kyle?

698
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,367
Dad, okay, look,

699
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,900
It's bad enough being seeing
with a teacher as a dad,

700
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,134
But being seen with
two teachers is aids.

701
00:31:49,134 --> 00:31:50,701
Okay, get dressed.
Put on something nice.

702
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,234
If you don't act right at dinner,
I'll stab you in the face.

703
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,967
So what do you like to do, Kyle?

704
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,401
Nothing.

705
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:04,501
Nothing? You must like
to do something.

706
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:06,534
No.

707
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,834
Kyle just got a new monitor
for his computer.

708
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:12,467
So what do you like
to do on the computer?

709
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,167
Oh, well, you know,
it's funny you ask.

710
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,967
- I like--
- Games, mostly.

711
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,701
- Kyle, who are you texting?
- Andrew.

712
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:23,900
Why don't you give it a break
while we're eating, son?

713
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,267
No, I can't do that.
It's important.

714
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:27,067
Put it away.

715
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:36,401
So, Kyle,

716
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:38,634
Do you have a girlfriend?

717
00:32:38,634 --> 00:32:42,234
I'm not gonna talk to you
about my personal affairs.

718
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:45,834
- Okay.
- Ooh.

719
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:47,100
Watch out.

720
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,067
Are you guys doing it?

721
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,300
Yeah, all the time.
Non-Stop.

722
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,334
I'm hurting right now.

723
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:02,234
Let's not make me throw up.

724
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,567
So do you play sports?

725
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:10,467
No no.
I'm a big spaz like my dad.

726
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,601
Well, I was on the dive team
in college.

727
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:16,000
Diving is not really
a sport, it's falling.

728
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:20,634
I'm sorry.

729
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:24,033
No offense.
It's just funny.

730
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:26,467
Hey, why don't we rent
a movie after dinner?

731
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:29,267
Sure, as long as
it's not horror.

732
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:31,434
- Really?
- I do not like horror.

733
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:33,701
Zombies? Are you
okay with zombies?

734
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:35,567
- No.
- Oh.

735
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:38,834
Do you like musicals?
I love musicals.

736
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:42,267
Bob Fosse was a great
director.

737
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:45,534
He did "sweet charity"
and "all that jazz."

738
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:48,667
- "Cabaret."
- One of the great nazi musicals of all time.

739
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,534
Besides "the sound of music," you know?

740
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:53,167
Then he did "star 80."
That was not a musical, but...

741
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:55,933
- I only like the musicals.
- Oh, well.

742
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,868
- Me too.
- "Willy Wonka."

743
00:33:57,868 --> 00:33:59,534
Which one?

744
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:02,200
Well, Gene Wilder.

745
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,801
- I like Johnny Depp.
- Oh.

746
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,401
- Yeah.
- Mm-Hm.

747
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:07,367
But, you know what? I like Gene Wilder...

748
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:12,100
- ...In "Young...
- Frankenstein."

749
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,933
"What hump?"

750
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,033
Did you see it?

751
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:19,167
- No.
- Oh, you should.

752
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,601
- It's amazing.
- Really wonderful.

753
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,167
Yeah.
Everybody's seen it.

754
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,601
- I'm sure.
- Yeah.

755
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:28,367
- Night, Miss. Reed.
- Good night, Kyle.

756
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,933
Do you think you're gonna
hit that shit tonight?

757
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:34,100
- Shut up!
- Come on, dude. That shit's tight, dude.

758
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,634
Seriously, if you don't nail her--

759
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,467
Hey hey, if you don't nail her,
dude, you're--

760
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,200
- You're an asshole.
- Will you stop it?

761
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Don't act like you don't think
about pussy all the time too.

762
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,734
- I know you do.
- Kyle.

763
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:44,834
You're dropping me off first, I get it.

764
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:47,234
- You want me to go.
- I just wanna say good night to her alone.

765
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:49,033
- Okay?
- With your cock.

766
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,768
Kyle, you ruin everything.

767
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,701
Would you just
shut the fuck up?

768
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:56,000
Jesus, man. You fucking need
to get laid. Go over there.

769
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,801
I'll be right back.

770
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:00,000
All right. Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, okay?

771
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,734
Short of killing her, that leaves
me a lot of room.

772
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,933
Hey, baby.

773
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,701
See you tomorrow, Kyle.

774
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:09,701
Night, whore.

775
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,100
Hey.

776
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,000
- That was fun.
- The kiss?

777
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,634
- Mm-Hmm.
- I'll show you something, come on.

778
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:22,434
- Not tonight.
- Wow.

779
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,033
Are you shooting me down?

780
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:26,467
Listen, I'd love to stay, but l
promised Kyle I'd be right back.

781
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,834
Kyle doesn't like me.

782
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,701
Oh no. He likes you a lot.

783
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:32,200
- No.
- Mm-Hmm.

784
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,467
He told me that when
I dropped him off.

785
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,200
- He did?
- Yeah.

786
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,933
He said I was a lucky guy.

787
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:39,734
No, I'm the lucky guy.

788
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:42,534
I gotta go.

789
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:44,801
Oh, come on.
He's almost an adult.

790
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:46,768
- Yeah.
- Mm-Hmm.

791
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:49,933
Whoa.

792
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:52,200
How are you gonna drive
home with that boner, huh?

793
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,834
I don't know. There's a stick-shift
joke there somewhere

794
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,300
But I can't find it 'cause all the
blood's leaving my brain.

795
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:03,167
- Sleep well.
- Hey.

796
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:08,167
Oh, that's sweet.
Mmm.

797
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:11,567
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Oh. Boo.

798
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:14,033
- You're mean.
- Good night, sweet pea.

799
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,401
Good night, cream cheese.

800
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:22,167
You know I--
Oh!

801
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,601
- Hmm?
- Damn you.

802
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:24,601
You sure?

803
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:33,367
I'm back.

804
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,501
Kyle.

805
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:41,234
Hey, Kyle.

806
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:44,467
Oh, Kyle. I told you to
stop doing that.

807
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,933
Kyle?

808
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:22,334
¶ don't be afraid ¶

809
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:26,900

836
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,801
Welcome back, Lance.

837
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:36,801
Hi.

838
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:39,033
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

839
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:41,701
If you need more time off,
take it.

840
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:44,067
Nobody here would
fault you for that.

841
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,100
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.

842
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:01,734
Ginger.

843
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:04,567
Hey, Mike.

844
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:07,067
It's good to have
you back, Lancelot.

845
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,567
Thanks.

846
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:26,234
Mr. Clayton.

847
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:28,334
Andrew.

848
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:30,967
How are you doing?

849
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,634
Okay.
I'm really sorry.

850
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,667
Thanks.

851
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,667
And I'm sorry
about my mom.

852
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:40,267
- Why?
- 'Cause she threw up in your planter

853
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,501
At that thing at your house after
the funeral.

854
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:43,933
I wondered who did that.

855
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:45,734
She drinks too much.

856
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:47,467
I know.

857
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:49,134
Don't worry, Andrew.

858
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:51,200
It meant a lot to me
that you came.

859
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Thanks, Mr. Clayton.
Mr. Clayton.

860
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,701
Something doesn't
make sense to me.

861
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:58,200
What, Andrew?

862
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,067
Did Kyle seemed that
bummed out to you?

863
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:03,033
What do you mean?

864
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:04,734
To do what he did.
He just--

865
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:08,033
It's just, he didn't
seem that sad.

866
00:43:09,701 --> 00:43:12,967
Andrew, Kyle was
a complex guy.

867
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,100
Yeah,
I'll say.

868
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:39,100
Hey.

869
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,634
Hey.

870
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:45,701
How are you?

871
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,567
I'm okay.

872
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:49,367
Good.

873
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,601
I want to apologize that I haven't
been there more for you.

874
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:58,467
It's just that I don't do death well.

875
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:00,467
Don't worry about it,
you know, I--

876
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:03,601
I've been kind of a zombie
lately anyway.

877
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:05,501
I'm really sorry.

878
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:07,134
Please don't be mad.

879
00:44:07,134 --> 00:44:08,868
I'm not.

880
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:12,267
Let's do something soon,
all right?

881
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:14,167
All right.

882
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,634
Cheer up, pumpkin.

883
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:21,434
I like you.

884
00:44:21,434 --> 00:44:23,401
Thanks.

885
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:36,300
hardly anyone came to the funeral.

886
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,033
I felt bad.
I should have gone.

887
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:40,734
Don't blame yourself.
It was a weekday.

888
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:45,834
Lance,

889
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,834
This is Mr. Pentola.

890
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:49,134
- Mr. Pentola.
- Dr. Pentola.

891
00:44:49,134 --> 00:44:50,701
Oh, doctor.

892
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:53,667
Nice to meet you, Mr. Clayton.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

893
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:54,801
Thank you.

894
00:44:54,801 --> 00:44:57,134
Dr. Pentola is a therapist.

895
00:44:57,134 --> 00:44:59,701
We called him in
because we were afraid

896
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:03,334
Kyle's death may
trigger other suicides.

897
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,167
He's a grief counsellor.

898
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,567
Oh.

899
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:07,967
Before we begin,

900
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,701
I've read a lot of
suicide notes,

901
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:13,200
And this one seemed...

902
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,067
deep.

903
00:45:15,067 --> 00:45:16,667
Really?

904
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,567
I need to ask you a question.

905
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:21,167
And I want you to be
completely honest with me.

906
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:23,234
Of course.

907
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:25,534
Did Kyle have any friends?

908
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:27,067
Excuse me?

909
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:29,067
Well, it's just
no one's come to see me.

910
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:30,701
You'd have to know Kyle.

911
00:45:30,701 --> 00:45:32,701
Well, I shouldn't say no one.

912
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:35,367
A couple of kids came in with age-
Appropriate depression,

913
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:36,734
Eating disorders.

914
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,534
One kid came in with head lice.

915
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:39,801
I know him.

916
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:41,834
Not really my area of expertise.

917
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:44,701
But no one's come to talk about Kyle.

918
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,701
Hmm.

919
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:50,167
- Oh.
- Who were his friends?

920
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:54,267
- Andrew Troutmen.
- And who else?

921
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:57,967
That's it.

922
00:45:57,967 --> 00:46:01,868
Kyle was kind of a loner.

923
00:46:01,868 --> 00:46:03,768
A lone wolf.

924
00:46:03,768 --> 00:46:07,300
Uh, I'll have to ask Andrew

925
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,134
To come and see me.

926
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,567
And, Lance, that goes
for you too.

927
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:14,534
If you need to talk, if you wanna
get anything off your chest,

928
00:46:14,534 --> 00:46:16,300
Please, just come and see me.

929
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,734
Of course, doc, I will.

930
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,868
Thank you, Lance.

931
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,367
You're welcome,
Mr. Anderson.

932
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:27,900
All right, guys,
who wants to read next?

933
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,701
- Right here!
- All right.

934
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:31,434
Who's gonna give me $20?

935
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:33,367
- Oh.
- Oh, come on now.

936
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:36,200
All right. Okay.

937
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,567
Jason.

938
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:48,134
Go ahead.

939
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,734
"Negro?

940
00:46:54,734 --> 00:46:56,868
I may be young
but I'm not your boy

941
00:46:56,868 --> 00:46:59,601
I won't pick your cotton
or pick up your dishes

942
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:02,801
Yeah, I sing, I dance

943
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:05,900
But I do it with the dignity
of my ancestors

944
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,334
I am not your monkey"

945
00:47:10,768 --> 00:47:12,100
Right on.

946
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:16,900
Stay black, y'all.

947
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:21,534
Anybody else
have their haiku?

948
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:20,300
- Hello?
- Hey, sweet tarts.

949
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,567
- Hey.
- How are you?

950
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,734
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching mike play basketball.

951
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:26,933
Oh.

952
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:31,367
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

953
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,300
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

954
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,033
- oh my god!
- What?

955
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:37,801
I gotta go.
Mike just won the basketball game.

956
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:40,868
Yeah, Mike!

957
00:48:53,134 --> 00:48:54,701
- Hi.
- Hi.

958
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:57,033
I made you something.

959
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:58,100
What?

960
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,267
- Those brownies.
- Oh.

961
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:03,134
- Oh.
- Yeah.

962
00:49:03,134 --> 00:49:05,134
Well, I'll come over and have some.

963
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:07,401
I was thinking maybe I could come in
and we'd eat them together.

964
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:08,768
No, I can't.

965
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:10,534
- Why not?
- I'm busy.

966
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,334
Bonnie, I really need
to talk to somebody.

967
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:14,734
I don't like people
in my apartment.

968
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:17,667
My apartment is a little
sad right now, you know?

969
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:23,634
If I-- If I let you in,
you can't tell anybody.

970
00:49:23,634 --> 00:49:25,768
- Okay.
- Okay.

971
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:28,967
So...

972
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:31,167
- Brownies, huh?
- Yeah.

973
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:33,401
- Come in.
- Ah.

974
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:42,401
Please, don't tell
anybody, okay?

975
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,834
Because I--
I don't wanna get thrown out of here.

976
00:49:44,834 --> 00:49:47,200
- Oh, I promise.
- Thanks.

977
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,701
I-I know
it's a fire hazard

978
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:52,834
And I know it's not
rational, but...

979
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:57,067
I feel that if I throw anything out,

980
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:59,267
Something terrible will happen.

981
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:01,000
- No, I understand that.
- Good.

982
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:13,000
What's wrong, sweetie?

983
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,801
I know my son was a jerk,
but I miss him.

984
00:50:18,801 --> 00:50:21,000
Hey.

985
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,100
- Of course you do.
- Mmm.

986
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,868
It'll get better.

987
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:28,467
It doesn't feel like it right now.

988
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:30,167
Do you know that

989
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:33,367
I have read every one
of your books?

990
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:34,834
How?

991
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:36,434
How?

992
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:38,134
You threw 'em out.

993
00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:39,900
Oh, yeah.

994
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,801
You are very talented.

995
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,100
Really?

996
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,601
Honest.
You have a gift.

997
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:49,601
And you can't give up.

998
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:51,100
I won't.

999
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,501
Listen,

1000
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:55,834
They're gonna have a zombie
marathon on television

1001
00:50:55,834 --> 00:50:58,967
And I cordially

1002
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:00,534
invite you, sir.

1003
00:51:00,534 --> 00:51:02,401
Oh, well, bless you, madam.

1004
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:04,200
- Uh-Huh.
- It's a date.

1005
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,401
Good.

1006
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:07,534
Don't forget the brownies.

1007
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:09,567
- I won't forget.
- No.

1008
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,167
Your dog's staring at me.

1009
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:17,801
What dog?

1010
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,267
I got ya.

1011
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:27,367
- Lance!
- Oh.

1012
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:29,567
- I'm glad I caught you.
- What's up?

1013
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:33,434
You know that while we
respect individual privacy,

1014
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:36,701
We also respect freedom of speech
and expression here at school?

1015
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:39,167
- Yeah.
- Well, one of the kids on the paper

1016
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:41,967
Went online and they found
Kyle's police report--

1017
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:45,667
The report of his death. And now they've
gone and published his suicide note.

1018
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:48,467
- Oh my god.
- Yeah. I just found out about it.

1019
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:50,933
I thought you should know
it's all over campus.

1020
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:53,367
- Really?
- Yeah.

1021
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:55,634
You--
Are you gonna be all right?

1022
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:57,667
Sure.

1023
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,933
I'm really sorry
about this, Lance.

1024
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:02,200
It's that goddamn first amendment,
huh?

1025
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,601
Yeah.

1026
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,334
"to all those I hate,

1027
00:52:11,334 --> 00:52:14,200
I don't know why
I'm writing this.

1028
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,900
You never cared about what l
thought or felt while I was alive.

1029
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,567
Besides you're all
too shallow

1030
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:21,734
To comprehend
the pain I feel."

1031
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:24,768
¶ I hope
I become a ghost ¶

1032
00:52:24,768 --> 00:52:28,100

00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,300
"which brings me to you, dad.

1052
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,367
don't blame yourself.

1053
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:15,267
You tried hard and were the
best dad a kid could want.

1054
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:18,634
I blame me doing this
on a defect in me...

1055
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:21,801
in my soul.

1056
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:23,768
I'm sorry."

1057
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:34,900
¶ now that I've become
a ghost ¶

1058
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:41,667
¶ I don't get to laugh
with friends like you ¶

1059
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:46,601
¶ there's nothing sad
about it ¶

1060
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:51,734
¶ there's nothing
sad about it. ¶

1061
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,534
I love you, dad.

1062
00:55:02,768 --> 00:55:06,667
Has anyone seen Carl or Steven?

1063
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:07,900
Mm-Hmm.

1064
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,467
Oh, you have?
So they're in school?

1065
00:55:10,467 --> 00:55:12,768
Yeah, I saw 'em
this morning.

1066
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:17,967
First of all I want to thank you
all for being here,

1067
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,834
Especially the newcomers.

1068
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:22,000
It means a lot to me.

1069
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,501
Who has experience
with writing poetry?

1070
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:27,167
-Yes, Heather.
- Can I ask a question?

1071
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,534
Sure.

1072
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:31,501
What was Kyle's favorite band?

1073
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:32,701
Uh...

1074
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:35,000
he liked Bruce Hornsby.

1075
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,200
Yes, Ray?

1076
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,967
Did he listen to any metal?

1077
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:41,601
- A little Ozzy.
- I knew it.

1078
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:44,967
Anybody have any questions
about poetry or...

1079
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,000
yes, Jason?

1080
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,868
Did the boy know Jesus
before he went?

1081
00:55:47,668 --> 00:55:50,434
Well, I would say
he was an Agnostic.

1082
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:52,934
But I think he was
spiritual in his own way.

1083
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:54,534
Yeah-- Yes, Heather?

1084
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:55,767
What's his sign?

1085
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:58,568
Oh, he was born
April 18th, so--

1086
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:00,601
Aries.

1087
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:03,301
I can't believe
you didn't know that.

1088
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:06,334
You know, anybody know
ezra pound?

1089
00:56:06,334 --> 00:56:08,601
Lawrence Ferlinghetti?

1090
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,201
You know what Kyle really liked?

1091
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:15,733
Emily Dickinson.

1092
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:17,501
What band is that?

1093
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:19,568
It wasn't a band.
She was a poet.

1094
00:56:19,568 --> 00:56:22,833
- She hot?
- Um, she was a Victorian.

1095
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:25,900
If you like your buttoned-down girl,
she was one of 'em.

1096
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,367
Nice.

1097
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:29,833
- Mr. Clayton.
- Peter.

1098
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:33,201
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

1099
00:56:33,201 --> 00:56:34,867
It's about Kyle's note.

1100
00:56:34,867 --> 00:56:36,867
It-- It affected me a lot.

1101
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:40,900
Well, it seemed to affect
a lot of students.

1102
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,167
- I'm not happy, Mr. Clayton.
- Mm-Hmm.

1103
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:46,201
I'm living a lie. I'm gay.

1104
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:48,201
And Kyle's suicide note,

1105
00:56:48,201 --> 00:56:51,234
It's helped me get the courage to
come out finally.

1106
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:53,467
Well, are you sure
you want to do that?

1107
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:55,634
I'm misunderstood too,
just like he was.

1108
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:57,700
I just want to be happy.

1109
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,668
Good for you, Peter.
I-I wish you the best.

1110
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,367
Thank you.

1111
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:09,668
Hey, Mr. Clayton.

1112
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:11,134
- Mr. Clayton.
- Ginger.

1113
00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:13,334
Kyle was right.
Emily Dickinson's great.

1114
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:15,234
Isn't she?

1115
00:57:15,234 --> 00:57:16,867
- Mr. Clayton?
- Yes.

1116
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:20,301
- I wrote another poem.
- Can't wait to hear it, Heather.

1117
00:57:20,301 --> 00:57:23,401
- John. Doctor.
- Hey.

1118
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:25,100
Claire.

1119
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,833
Mr. C, what's up?

1120
00:57:30,134 --> 00:57:34,301
"Milky white skin
and hair so brown

1121
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:37,234
I wish I had known
how bad you hurt

1122
00:57:37,234 --> 00:57:39,900
I could have held you
while you cried

1123
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,100
you were too sweet
to stay

1124
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,867
In this harsh world

1125
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:47,234
but I will always
keep you close to my heart

1126
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:51,000
Oh, wow.

1127
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:10,034
He was such
a sweet kid.

1128
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:12,234
And kind.

1129
00:58:14,034 --> 00:58:17,034
Oh, please.
They're everywhere.

1130
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:19,034
as a father,

1131
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:22,167
I don't know what I'd do if
hunter did something like this.

1132
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:24,100
My heart really goes
out to you, Lance.

1133
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,767
Thanks.

1134
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:28,301
It's so sad. I didn't know he was
such a good writer.

1135
00:58:28,301 --> 00:58:31,067
Did he write anything else?

1136
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,767
Yeah, he did.

1137
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:39,167
I know it's really personal, but do
you think I could read it?

1138
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,000
Well, if you came over
to my apartment.

1139
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,934
I just don't want his stuff out there,
you know, floating around.

1140
00:58:44,934 --> 00:58:47,267
Sure.
How about tonight?

1141
00:58:47,267 --> 00:58:48,534
Great.

1142
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:55,234
My playoff game's tonight.

1143
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,134
All right.
Not the lip.

1144
00:59:00,134 --> 00:59:01,700
You know I can't take the lip.

1145
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,401
Oh, thanks, Mike.

1146
00:59:05,234 --> 00:59:06,833
What time?

1147
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:10,334
I'm gonna need a little time because
you know, I haven't cleaned.

1148
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,134
Yeah, I understand.

1149
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:16,301
- Well, 8:00?
- That's great.

1150
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:25,267
Good luck tonight.

1151
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:27,833
Thanks.

1152
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:31,100
If you think this
is a bad idea--

1153
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,301
No no no.
Not at all.

1154
00:59:33,301 --> 00:59:35,800
I found something Kyle wrote

1155
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,301
And I really think
you need to hear it.

1156
00:59:39,301 --> 00:59:41,267
Okay.

1157
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:57,500
This is from his journal.

1158
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,400
"I went out to dinner with
my dad and Claire tonight.

1159
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:04,901
I'm so happy for him,

1160
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,701
But at the same time
seeing them together

1161
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:10,534
Only proves that I'll
never be happy.

1162
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:14,367
I know I'll never find
a woman like her--

1163
01:00:14,367 --> 01:00:18,001
So pretty,
so perfect.

1164
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:21,500
She seems to complete him.

1165
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:27,367
I hope they make it.

1166
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:30,134
I hope they last.

1167
01:00:30,134 --> 01:00:33,134
I hope I'm leaving
my dad in good hands.

1168
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,834
No one could ever get me.

1169
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,967
I don't even get me."

1170
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,368
Oh.

1171
01:00:45,368 --> 01:00:48,667
I didn't know anyone
could feel that way about me.

1172
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:51,034
He did like me.
He really did.

1173
01:00:51,034 --> 01:00:52,700
He did.
He really did.

1174
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,967
I thought you were lying
to make me feel better.

1175
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:57,600
No.
I'd never do that.

1176
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,834
- Really?
- Really.

1177
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:26,201
Mr. Clayton.

1178
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:28,401
- Good morning, heather.
- Yes.

1179
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:30,101
Good morning.

1180
01:01:30,101 --> 01:01:33,201
Do you have anything
of Kyle's?

1181
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:34,401
What?

1182
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:37,034
That I could have?

1183
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:38,967
- No.
- Oh.

1184
01:01:40,034 --> 01:01:41,867
Wait a second.

1185
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:47,734
Here you go.

1186
01:01:47,734 --> 01:01:49,234
Bruce Hornsby?

1187
01:01:49,234 --> 01:01:52,834
That was his favorite.

1188
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,533
Thank you.

1189
01:02:12,434 --> 01:02:15,401
I need to talk
about last night.

1190
01:02:15,401 --> 01:02:17,600
Yeah, I need to talk
about last night too.

1191
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,201
Yeah.

1192
01:02:20,201 --> 01:02:23,134
I'm tired of hiding
our relationship.

1193
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,700
Mmm.

1194
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,267
- Dan.
- Lance.

1195
01:02:56,267 --> 01:02:59,368
- Ginger.
- Mr. Clayton, look at this.

1196
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:01,101
Oh.

1197
01:03:04,867 --> 01:03:06,867
Heather.

1198
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:08,567
Hey, Mr. C.

1199
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:11,600
Oh, Peter.

1200
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,867
- Don't leave me hanging.
- Oh.

1201
01:03:13,867 --> 01:03:16,101
I don't know if Kyle
ever told you,

1202
01:03:16,101 --> 01:03:17,767
But he and I were
kinda bros.

1203
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:19,767
I'm gonna win this game
tonight in his honor.

1204
01:03:19,767 --> 01:03:21,600
Great, Peter.

1205
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:37,267
Mr. Clayton?

1206
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:38,468
Andrew.

1207
01:03:38,468 --> 01:03:40,900
It doesn't seem right,
does it?

1208
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,734
What doesn't seem right?

1209
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:44,533
How everyone is acting.

1210
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:46,468
Like they liked Kyle.

1211
01:03:46,468 --> 01:03:48,600
No, it doesn't.

1212
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,734
You know what else
is weird?

1213
01:03:50,734 --> 01:03:54,267
- What?
- Kyle's suicide note.

1214
01:03:54,267 --> 01:03:56,134
In what way?

1215
01:03:56,134 --> 01:03:58,633
That stuff about being
an insignificant molecule

1216
01:03:58,633 --> 01:04:01,401
Bouncing around in a
meaningless godless universe.

1217
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:05,034
Don't take this the wrong way,
but Kyle was...

1218
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:07,067
what?

1219
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:09,101
Kinda dumb.

1220
01:04:09,101 --> 01:04:11,301
Ha. No.

1221
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:14,401
Kyle was actually smart, Andrew.

1222
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:17,600
You know, he just pretended
to be dumb, even around you

1223
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,533
So, you know, people
wouldn't pick on him.

1224
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,600
Yeah, maybe.

1225
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,500
- It's mine!
- Let go, you crazy--

1226
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,001
Hey!

1227
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:28,567
Oh! Get off!

1228
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:30,101
You didn't even
like Kyle!

1229
01:04:30,101 --> 01:04:31,633
You didn't like Kyle!

1230
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:33,567
Shut up, whore!

1231
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:46,134
Bruce Hornsby?

1232
01:04:46,134 --> 01:04:48,368
I need to talk to someone.

1233
01:04:48,368 --> 01:04:49,834
That's why I'm here.

1234
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:52,734
I feel terrible.

1235
01:04:52,734 --> 01:04:54,734
Suicide leaves many victims.

1236
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:56,900
Don't beat yourself up.

1237
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,267
Kyle may have been suffering
from a chemical imbalance.

1238
01:04:59,267 --> 01:05:01,967
And I know that the note
being published

1239
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:04,034
Has caused you some
distress,

1240
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:07,633
But in many ways it's been
a very positive thing.

1241
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:09,700
Students are
coming to see me.

1242
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,667
It's the breakthrough
I've been waiting for.

1243
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,001
Who knows how many
of these kids

1244
01:05:14,001 --> 01:05:17,101
I can help because they're
reaching out for the first time?

1245
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:20,600
You have to remember
the part where Kyle writes:

1246
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,667
"I love you, dad."

1247
01:05:24,201 --> 01:05:26,401
But what if he didn't
really feel that way?

1248
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:28,567
But he did.

1249
01:05:28,567 --> 01:05:32,001
Lance, suicide

1250
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:34,533
is a permanent solution

1251
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:36,834
to temporary problems.

1252
01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:38,867
and who knows

1253
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:41,633
how many kids we won't lose
because of that note?

1254
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:44,633
Keep your chin up knowing

1255
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:47,900
that Kyle may have not
died in vain.

1256
01:05:50,067 --> 01:05:53,734
¶ in light of all
I've learned so far ¶

1257
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:56,500
¶ I don't believe
I'm so strange ¶

1258
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,600
¶ in spite of all
this time I spend ¶

1259
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,234
¶ calling the air
by a name ¶

1260
01:06:02,234 --> 01:06:05,267
¶ when the first light
goes over the trees ¶

1261
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:07,600
¶ he will be
singing with me ¶

1262
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,767
¶ and if I feel like
singing alone ¶

1263
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:13,600
¶ he always
leaves me be ¶

1264
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,367
¶ I'm shaking
my shadow hand ¶

1265
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:19,234
¶ as the sun moves
round the bend ¶

1266
01:06:19,234 --> 01:06:22,134
¶ with an imaginary man

1267
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:28,001
¶ and we'll make-Believe
around and around again ¶

1268
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:31,067
¶ I'm shaking
my shadow hand... ¶

1269
01:06:37,433 --> 01:06:38,801
Dr. Pentola.

1270
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:40,534
Lance, you don't look so good.

1271
01:06:40,534 --> 01:06:42,467
Well, I had kind of
a rough weekend.

1272
01:06:42,467 --> 01:06:44,168
I did a lot of soul searching

1273
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,667
And I thought about what
you said about Kyle's note

1274
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:48,433
And the effect
on the other kids,

1275
01:06:48,433 --> 01:06:50,767
And...

1276
01:06:50,767 --> 01:06:52,767
this is Kyle's Journal.

1277
01:06:52,767 --> 01:06:54,734
I brought it to you to read.

1278
01:06:54,734 --> 01:06:57,834
I want you to read it, and if you think
it'll be of value to the other kids,

1279
01:06:57,834 --> 01:07:00,168
I wanna publish it
and hand it out to them.

1280
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:05,268
- I'll see if I can't give it a look.
- Oh, thanks.

1281
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,934
well?

1282
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,201
It's so sad.

1283
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:17,567
Yeah.

1284
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,801
I mean, Kyle was such

1285
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:22,600
A strong powerful writer.

1286
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,467
So tortured.

1287
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:27,168
Yes, he was.

1288
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,300
What are you
gonna call it?

1289
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,567
I was thinking
"l am what I hate."

1290
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:36,967
What?

1291
01:07:36,967 --> 01:07:41,367
"I am what I hate."
Kyle wrote that in chapter six.

1292
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:42,934
Oh.

1293
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

1294
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,300
I don't like it at all.

1295
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,600
Why?

1296
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,634
- To me, a better title...
- Mm-Hmm.

1297
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:56,834
...would be
"you don't know me."

1298
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:58,201
- Oh.
- You know?

1299
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:01,201
Because
we didn't know him.

1300
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:05,700
But he didn't write
that though, I mean...

1301
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,834
yeah, but
he felt that.

1302
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,168
- You're inferring that from him.
- Yes.

1303
01:08:10,168 --> 01:08:12,300
Oh.

1304
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,268
"I am what I hate"
doesn't make sense as a title.

1305
01:08:17,467 --> 01:08:21,034
Give me a kiss.
Aw.

1306
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:26,834
- Come here.
- Oh.

1307
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:31,934
¶ everybody wants
to be a genius ¶

1308
01:08:34,268 --> 01:08:37,433
¶ you're not the only one ¶

1309
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:40,400
¶ with all things that
you might do ¶

1310
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,534
¶ which one of them
will you get to? ¶

1311
01:08:43,534 --> 01:08:46,433
¶ tomorrow when
you wake up ¶

1312
01:08:46,433 --> 01:08:49,134
¶ then you'll show them ¶

1313
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:57,134
¶ nobody wants
to break your heart ¶

1314
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,600
¶ you do it on your own

1315
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,300
¶ there's nothing wrong
with you today ¶

1316
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:09,034
¶ nothing you had
that they took away ¶

1317
01:09:09,034 --> 01:09:12,201
¶ but all the time
you've waited for ¶

1318
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:14,400
¶ what is owed to you

1319
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,734
¶ you wanna fight,
they will fight you blue ¶

1320
01:09:17,734 --> 01:09:21,600
¶ you wanna lie,
who will lie with you? ¶

1321
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,734
¶ you're the only one
waiting for a sign ¶

1322
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:30,700
¶ so you're the only one ¶

1323
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,767
¶ so you're
the only one ¶

1324
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:47,134
¶ everyone's had
some situation ¶

1325
01:09:47,134 --> 01:09:51,168
¶ keep it to yourself

1326
01:09:51,168 --> 01:09:53,834
¶ there's no need to answer
questions ¶

1327
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:57,767
¶ your lies have spoiled
two confessions ¶

1328
01:09:57,767 --> 01:10:00,101
¶ and all the time
you've waited ¶

1329
01:10:00,101 --> 01:10:02,967
¶ won't come back to you ¶

1330
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:06,867
¶ you wanna fight,
they will fight you blue ¶

1331
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:10,234
¶ you wanna lie,
who will lie with you? ¶

1332
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:13,700
¶ you're the only one
waiting for a sign... ¶

1333
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,834
¶ so you're the only one ¶

1334
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:21,067
¶ so you're
the only one ¶

1335
01:10:21,067 --> 01:10:24,801
¶ everybody wants to be
a genius. ¶

1336
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:28,967
Everybody loves the book.

1337
01:10:28,967 --> 01:10:30,901
Yes, they do.

1338
01:10:30,901 --> 01:10:33,600
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1339
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,101
Fuck me.

1340
01:10:35,101 --> 01:10:37,567
- I am.
- Harder.

1341
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,067
No no no.
From behind.

1342
01:10:42,067 --> 01:10:44,001
Okay. Okay.

1343
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,700
- Like that?
- Yeah.

1344
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,101
- Okay.
- To the left.

1345
01:10:50,101 --> 01:10:52,867
To the left.
My left. My left.

1346
01:10:52,867 --> 01:10:54,967
Okay.
Yeah!

1347
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:56,467
Yeah.
Don't stop.

1348
01:10:56,467 --> 01:11:00,234
Don't stop.
Don't stop!

1349
01:11:00,234 --> 01:11:01,867
- Stop! Stop. Stop.
- Okay. Sorry.

1350
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:03,534
- Pull my hair.
- Like that?

1351
01:11:03,534 --> 01:11:05,300
- Not-- Not so hard.
- Oh, okay.

1352
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,901
Are you ready for
our undead marathon?

1353
01:11:07,901 --> 01:11:10,134
Well, that's the thing.
Something came up.

1354
01:11:10,134 --> 01:11:12,300
Kind of an emergency.
I can't make it.

1355
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,333
- Sorry.
- Oh. No, it's okay.

1356
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:17,634
- Can I take a rain check?
- Oh yeah, dear. Good.

1357
01:11:17,634 --> 01:11:19,734
Yeah, listen l--
I hope everything's okay.

1358
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:21,534
Oh, yeah.
It's just a small emergency.

1359
01:11:21,534 --> 01:11:25,500
- Okay. See you.
- Sorry. Bye.

1360
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,700
Everything okay there, pal?

1361
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,901
Yeah, great.

1362
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:31,367
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1363
01:11:31,367 --> 01:11:33,400
You know what line
really blew me away,

1364
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,201
Is when Kyle wrote:

1365
01:11:35,201 --> 01:11:38,667
"America is one of the finest countries
anyone ever stole."

1366
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:40,834
That was brilliant.

1367
01:11:40,834 --> 01:11:43,201
He reminds me
of my hunter.

1368
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:46,667
Lance, I have
a confession to make.

1369
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:49,300
I lured you out here
under false pretenses.

1370
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,634
I need to ask you
something.

1371
01:11:51,634 --> 01:11:54,867
Would it be all right with
you if we renamed the library

1372
01:11:54,867 --> 01:11:57,600
The Kyle Clayton Memorial Library?

1373
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,967
But you were gonna put him
in a special-needs class.

1374
01:12:01,168 --> 01:12:02,801
Yeah.

1375
01:12:02,801 --> 01:12:05,067
Yeah, and I feel
really bad about that.

1376
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:07,333
- Oh.
- He wasn't slow.

1377
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,333
Obviously he was brilliant.

1378
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,934
He was just bored.

1379
01:12:11,934 --> 01:12:14,034
You know, we had him totally wrong.

1380
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:17,867
I just hope to god that our mistake
didn't have anything to do with--

1381
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:19,967
Well, with
what happened.

1382
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,400
I'm pretty sure
it didn't.

1383
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,567
Thanks, Lance.

1384
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:24,667
Your saying that
means a lot.

1385
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:27,767
This tribute will be an inspiration
to other students

1386
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:29,734
And it'll help keep
Kyle's memory alive.

1387
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:33,300
Sure, sir.
Wyatt.

1388
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,801
Thanks, Lance.
Thanks.

1389
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:42,234
Oh!

1390
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:45,634
Just like my prom night,
nothing went in the hole.

1391
01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:50,168
No, it's good.
It's gonna be a tasteful dedication.

1392
01:12:50,168 --> 01:12:51,634
Very tasteful.

1393
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,433
Hello?

1394
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:03,001
You're kidding me.

1395
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,901
Thank you so much.

1396
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:07,700
- Wow.
- What?

1397
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,834
Pentola-- He sent
Kyle's Journal to Dr. Dana.

1398
01:13:10,834 --> 01:13:12,667
She loves it. She wants me
to be on the show.

1399
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:14,201
She's gonna fly me
to LA.

1400
01:13:14,201 --> 01:13:16,901
- What's Dr. Dana?
- She's like Oprah.

1401
01:13:18,134 --> 01:13:20,433
Well, she's not as big as Oprah.

1402
01:13:22,467 --> 01:13:24,467
I mean, it's a good show,
you know?

1403
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:26,367
Women seem to
really like it.

1404
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,834
- Andrew.
- Are you busy, Mr. Clayton?

1405
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:42,268
Oh, no no.
Just packing for my trip.

1406
01:13:42,268 --> 01:13:44,567
Yeah, that TV show.

1407
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:46,767
"Dr. Dana."

1408
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,934
What's up?

1409
01:13:49,934 --> 01:13:51,333
I feel bad.

1410
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:54,134
I wish I knew
he was that depressed.

1411
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:56,001
You and me both.

1412
01:13:56,001 --> 01:13:58,333
You know what's strange
about the book?

1413
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,534
What?

1414
01:13:59,534 --> 01:14:02,967
Kyle never talks
about vaginas, anal sex,

1415
01:14:02,967 --> 01:14:05,367
Fisting, felching
or rim jobs.

1416
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:08,734
It is a little light on the felching area,
you're right.

1417
01:14:08,734 --> 01:14:12,500
But I think it's there,
Andrew, in its own way.

1418
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,300
I was his best friend.
The book is so smart and sad.

1419
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,433
He never talked
with me like that.

1420
01:14:18,433 --> 01:14:21,667
I wish he did. Maybe he wouldn't have
done what he did.

1421
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:23,834
Don't blame yourself,
Andrew.

1422
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,134
One thing I know,
he liked you.

1423
01:14:26,134 --> 01:14:27,767
Then why didn't he talk to me?

1424
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:29,367
What do you want me
to tell you, Andrew?

1425
01:14:29,367 --> 01:14:30,934
Maybe it's like
I told you before,

1426
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:32,934
He was super smart.
He didn't want people to know

1427
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:34,734
Because he was afraid
of being treated differently.

1428
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:37,333
But it doesn't make sense.
He was already treated like a freak.

1429
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:39,901
If he was that smart he would have
loved to rub their noses in it.

1430
01:14:39,901 --> 01:14:42,500
Oh, Jesus Christ, Andrew.
Why can't you let it go, okay?

1431
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,934
No wonder your mother drinks.

1432
01:14:44,934 --> 01:14:47,901
You know one of the last
things Kyle said to me?

1433
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:50,901
He said that you're
a stupid fucking idiot.

1434
01:14:50,901 --> 01:14:52,934
Have a good time
on your TV show.

1435
01:14:52,934 --> 01:14:54,801
Kyle's still dead.

1436
01:14:54,801 --> 01:14:56,367
Andrew.

1437
01:14:59,034 --> 01:15:01,534
Are you almost ready?
I think we should get going.

1438
01:15:01,534 --> 01:15:03,600
I think you should keep
your pants on.

1439
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,433
I think you should put
your pants on.

1440
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:07,134
I'm not going
to wear pants.

1441
01:15:07,134 --> 01:15:09,667
Oh.
I'm really nervous.

1442
01:15:09,667 --> 01:15:11,067
Yeah, you should be.

1443
01:15:11,067 --> 01:15:12,767
Mmm. Thanks.

1444
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,901
I'm using backward psychology.

1445
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:17,667
It's not working. I have to pee again.

1446
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:25,333
- Hello.
- Mr. Clayton,

1447
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:28,201
I don't wanna be rude
but the show called again

1448
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:31,034
- And we really should be leaving.
- Okay, thank you very much.

1449
01:15:32,867 --> 01:15:34,967
Baby, that was the driver.
He said the show called.

1450
01:15:34,967 --> 01:15:36,834
We gotta get going, okay?

1451
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:39,268
Oh, you look gorgeous. Let's get going, come on.

1452
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,801
- Does this make my ass look big?
- No no. Not at all.

1453
01:15:41,801 --> 01:15:44,034
- You can't see your ass.
- What do you mean?

1454
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:46,867
- I mean--
- So you're saying I don't have an ass?

1455
01:15:46,867 --> 01:15:49,901
I'm saying your ass is there,
but it's not too much.

1456
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:51,867
- I'm changing again.
- No.

1457
01:15:53,901 --> 01:15:55,667
You know,
sweetheart,

1458
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:58,168
I really should get over there so l
could sit down with the producer

1459
01:15:58,168 --> 01:15:59,667
And go over with what
I'm gonna say.

1460
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:01,201
That would
really help me a lot.

1461
01:16:01,201 --> 01:16:02,467
- All right.
- Okay.

1462
01:16:02,467 --> 01:16:04,433
- What do you think?
- Fabulous.

1463
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:06,168
- I really--
- Nope.

1464
01:16:06,168 --> 01:16:07,734
I like that dress.

1465
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:12,101
Sometimes people on the way,
they throw up in my car.

1466
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:13,734
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1467
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:15,901
Okay, let's go.

1468
01:16:15,901 --> 01:16:19,300
- You look pretty.
- Thank you. You're so sweet.

1469
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,367
Thanks. Which one of you
is on the show?

1470
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:24,034
- I am.
- Oh.

1471
01:16:24,034 --> 01:16:26,201
- No, you're gonna do great.
- Thanks.

1472
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:29,034
Hi, Lance Clayton
for the "Dr. Dana" show.

1473
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:30,934
- Hi, guys.
- Dr. P.

1474
01:16:30,934 --> 01:16:33,600
Lance, hi.
Jerry Klein-- We spoke on the phone.

1475
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,467
- Mm-Hmm.
- We can let them in.

1476
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:38,134
Follow me. We can go right in.
We're running a little late.

1477
01:16:38,134 --> 01:16:40,067
- You guys hit some traffic, huh?
- Oh yeah.

1478
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:41,634
- Ah, wonderful.
- This is Claire, my girlfriend.

1479
01:16:41,634 --> 01:16:43,333
- Hi, Claudia. Jerry Klein.
- Claire.

1480
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,901
We're not gonna have time
to go through the notes

1481
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,433
In the greenroom
as we planned,

1482
01:16:47,433 --> 01:16:48,967
- So we're gonna do it in makeup.
- Makeup?

1483
01:16:48,967 --> 01:16:50,934
- And that's this way. Claudia?
- Claire.

1484
01:16:50,934 --> 01:16:53,333
Thank you so much for sending
the photos of Kyle. They're beautiful.

1485
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:55,101
- And also the book.
- I sent the book.

1486
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:56,901
Is she gonna be holding
up the back of the book?

1487
01:16:56,901 --> 01:16:59,067
That's a director question.
I'm a segment producer.

1488
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:01,168
How do we know
when the camera is on me?

1489
01:17:01,168 --> 01:17:03,667
You're gonna be in the
friends-and-family section.

1490
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,467
Could you grab a seat?

1491
01:17:05,467 --> 01:17:07,001
Okay, yeah.
Sure.

1492
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:09,901
I just have a couple of
issues to discuss with Lance.

1493
01:17:09,901 --> 01:17:12,101
- Lance, do you have questions?
- No no.

1494
01:17:12,101 --> 01:17:13,500
- Look over here, please.
- Good. Good.

1495
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,333
So, Lance, if you should start to talk
about your son...

1496
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,667
- mm-Hmm.
- ...and begin to cry...

1497
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:19,367
- yeah.
- ...or well up...

1498
01:17:19,367 --> 01:17:21,500
- okay.
- ...just go with it. Don't be ashamed, okay?

1499
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,867
- Yeah.
- And if you cry...

1500
01:17:22,867 --> 01:17:24,433
- mm-Hmm.
- ...look up.

1501
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:25,901
- No, look down, please.
- Oh.

1502
01:17:25,901 --> 01:17:27,534
- Don't look down. Look up.
- Can you look down?

1503
01:17:27,534 --> 01:17:29,300
- Don't tuck your chin.
- Oh.

1504
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,767
And above all,
don't be nervous.

1505
01:17:31,767 --> 01:17:33,600
Lance, hi.

1506
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,867
- Look this way, please.
- I don't mean to bug you right now.

1507
01:17:35,867 --> 01:17:37,967
My name is Bert Green.
I'm with with McKenna Artist.

1508
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:40,534
- Hi, Bert.
- Your son's memoir is so strong.

1509
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:43,300
My god, it's so moving.
My heart goes out to you.

1510
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,834
Mm-Hmm.

1511
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:46,901
- Oh, thank you.
- Have you been talking to publishers?

1512
01:17:46,901 --> 01:17:48,767
- No.
- Because I honestly think this could be

1513
01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:50,201
The biggest posthumous
autobiography

1514
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:51,734
Since "the diary
of Anne Frank," honestly.

1515
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:52,834
- Really?
- Oh my god.

1516
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:55,500
You know
what she's done for...

1517
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,367
yes.
Yeah, that's huge.

1518
01:17:57,367 --> 01:17:59,500
Look, I'm gonna get out
of your hair right now.

1519
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,967
But if any of this
interests you,

1520
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,400
- Give me a call, okay?
- Okay.

1521
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,168
Just give me a ring.
It's great to meet you.

1522
01:18:04,168 --> 01:18:07,201
Great to meet you.
Go out there and kill 'em.

1523
01:18:07,201 --> 01:18:09,700
- Do it.
- Okay.

1524
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:13,667
- Now I'm nervous.
- Oh, great.

1525
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:15,268
- It's go time, all right?
- Okay.

1526
01:18:15,268 --> 01:18:17,934
So again, Lance,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1527
01:18:17,934 --> 01:18:20,400
And let's have
a great show.

1528
01:18:27,834 --> 01:18:31,367
My guest today
is Mr. Lance Clayton.

1529
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:35,634
Lance's 15-year-old son
Kyle tragically took his own life.

1530
01:18:35,634 --> 01:18:38,168
But from this terrible
story of loss

1531
01:18:38,168 --> 01:18:40,268
Arose one of hope.

1532
01:18:40,268 --> 01:18:44,400
Here he is to share this powerful story,
Mr. Lance Clayton.

1533
01:18:47,433 --> 01:18:49,433
Thanks so much
for joining us.

1534
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:52,001
- Thank you, doctor.
- We know it takes great courage for you to do this.

1535
01:18:52,001 --> 01:18:54,467
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1536
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:56,700
Now, Lance--

1537
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,067
Is it all right
if I call you Lance?

1538
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,201
Yes, that's my name.

1539
01:19:02,967 --> 01:19:06,934
One of the most difficult things
is for a parent to lose a child.

1540
01:19:06,934 --> 01:19:09,834
Yes. Yes it is.

1541
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:12,268
Tell us about
your son Kyle.

1542
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,201
It's difficult,
isn't it?

1543
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:25,067
Yeah.

1544
01:19:25,067 --> 01:19:27,767
He was a sweet boy.

1545
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:33,500
Kind.

1546
01:19:37,168 --> 01:19:39,101
I'm sorry.
He was a sweet boy.

1547
01:19:46,367 --> 01:19:49,634
- I'm sorry.
- But there was a lot brewing underneath?

1548
01:19:49,634 --> 01:19:53,667
The tragedy is I didn't
know until his death

1549
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:56,201
How sad he was
or profound.

1550
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,333
Mmm.

1551
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:02,300
Here's a tissue
for you.

1552
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,700
Profound.
Indeed profound.

1553
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,001
Indeed.

1554
01:20:07,001 --> 01:20:09,634
"You don't know me."

1555
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:11,667
This is so beautifully
written.

1556
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:14,500
I just--
You know, the thing is,

1557
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,834
I didn't know-- I'm so proud of him.
He was a great writer.

1558
01:20:17,834 --> 01:20:20,934
Yes, this is really
remarkable work.

1559
01:20:20,934 --> 01:20:23,300
No matter what page
I turn to,

1560
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:27,300
There's something here
that really moves me.

1561
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,400
- I want to read this.
- Okay.

1562
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:33,268
"Is it more important
for me to be a good person

1563
01:20:33,268 --> 01:20:36,367
Or to be thought of
as a good person?

1564
01:20:36,367 --> 01:20:39,268
I'm so sick
of living a life in fear

1565
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:42,101
Of being found out
for the phony I am,

1566
01:20:42,101 --> 01:20:45,101
A life where I don't trust
anyone's intentions,

1567
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:48,534
Including my own."

1568
01:20:48,534 --> 01:20:50,067
Wow, that is really deep.

1569
01:20:50,067 --> 01:20:54,101
Hard to imagine that it was written
by a 15-Year-Old.

1570
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:57,168
- He was an old soul.
- Mmm.

1571
01:20:57,168 --> 01:21:00,700
You know, I'm not gonna pretend
that I know what's going on

1572
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,600
In the mind
of a teenager.

1573
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,867
All I'm saying is,
Kyle made a mistake.

1574
01:21:04,867 --> 01:21:06,934
If you're that depressed,

1575
01:21:06,934 --> 01:21:09,801
Reach out to someone.

1576
01:21:09,801 --> 01:21:13,168
And remember, suicide
is a permanent solution

1577
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:14,734
To temporary problems.

1578
01:21:14,734 --> 01:21:19,034
- You want my job?
- No. Please, Dana, no. Thank you.

1579
01:21:19,034 --> 01:21:22,467
Again, the book,
"you don't know me."

1580
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:24,767
And my guest has been
Lance Clayton.

1581
01:21:24,767 --> 01:21:27,734
Thank you.

1582
01:21:27,734 --> 01:21:30,101
You were so good!

1583
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:32,634
Thanks, doll.

1584
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:35,367
And I'm so glad
you used my title.

1585
01:21:35,367 --> 01:21:36,901
It's a great title.

1586
01:21:38,367 --> 01:21:40,168
Hello?

1587
01:21:40,168 --> 01:21:41,967
Lance, hi.
It's Bert Green.

1588
01:21:41,967 --> 01:21:44,634
- Hi.
- You were so great on "Dr. Dana."

1589
01:21:44,634 --> 01:21:46,567
Oh, thanks, Bert.

1590
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:49,567
It was like--
It was like watching a ballet.

1591
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:51,967
Hey, do you have time
to meet tomorrow?

1592
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:53,901
Because there's a number
of publishers

1593
01:21:53,901 --> 01:21:56,400
Who are dying

1594
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,767
- To meet with you.
- Well, really, no.

1595
01:21:59,767 --> 01:22:01,867
Actually we have
to head back tomorrow.

1596
01:22:01,867 --> 01:22:05,067
They're dedicating the school library
in Kyle's honor.

1597
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:07,433
Good for him.
I mean, good for you.

1598
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:09,168
That's good.

1599
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:11,767
Hey, let's do it soon.

1600
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:14,034
Because this book is hot.

1601
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:17,700
It's like a volcano on the sun.

1602
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:19,901
Wow. That's a lot of heat.

1603
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:21,367
I'm gonna get a hold
of you soon.

1604
01:22:21,367 --> 01:22:23,400
Okay? Bye.

1605
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:55,934
Lance, Lance.

1606
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:57,734
Oh, god.
I'm glad I caught you.

1607
01:22:57,734 --> 01:22:59,500
Oh, your book is on fire.

1608
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,934
- Oh.
- It is.

1609
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,101
This is--
This is Bill Tobin.

1610
01:23:03,101 --> 01:23:04,600
- Hi.
- From Simon & Simon.

1611
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,767
- Carl Klienman from Howard Publishing.
- Hi.

1612
01:23:06,767 --> 01:23:09,967
And this is George Kenny,
from Kaufmann Press.

1613
01:23:09,967 --> 01:23:11,967
They love your book
and they wanna meet with you.

1614
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:13,967
- It's true.
- Really.

1615
01:23:13,967 --> 01:23:15,867
We're not gonna bother
with that right now.

1616
01:23:15,867 --> 01:23:18,901
They're gonna have a chance to talk
with you after the dedication, okay?

1617
01:23:18,901 --> 01:23:20,201
- Good.
- Okay?

1618
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:24,801
And they also want
a book of yours too.

1619
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:28,367
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

1620
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:30,500
- Okay.
- See you in there.

1621
01:23:35,433 --> 01:23:38,367
I'm so proud of you,
lamb chop.

1622
01:23:38,367 --> 01:23:39,901
Thanks.

1623
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:48,367
Mr. Clayton.

1624
01:23:48,367 --> 01:23:49,834
Bruce Hornsby.

1625
01:23:49,834 --> 01:23:51,901
We wrote Mr. Hornsby and he came.

1626
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:53,901
Hey, man, when I heard
what a fan Kyle was

1627
01:23:53,901 --> 01:23:55,934
I thought,
how can I say no?

1628
01:23:55,934 --> 01:23:57,168
Aw.

1629
01:23:57,168 --> 01:23:59,234
- Thanks.
- God, he's so sweet.

1630
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,067
Bruce Hornsby.

1631
01:24:16,268 --> 01:24:19,234
I'd like to dedicate
this song to my biggest fan,

1632
01:24:19,234 --> 01:24:23,333
Kyle Clayton.

1633
01:24:37,567 --> 01:24:41,034
¶ another song
came and went ¶

1634
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:44,168
¶ like the times
that we spent ¶

1635
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:47,234
¶ hiding out
from the rain ¶

1636
01:24:47,234 --> 01:24:50,600
¶ under the carnival tent

1637
01:24:51,801 --> 01:24:54,333
¶ I laughed
and she'd smile ¶

1638
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:57,268
¶ it would last
for a while ¶

1639
01:24:57,268 --> 01:24:59,600
¶ you don't know
what you got ¶

1640
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,634
¶ till you lose it
all again ¶

1641
01:25:03,634 --> 01:25:06,467
¶ listen to
the mandolin rain ¶

1642
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:09,534
¶ listen to the music
on the lake ¶

1643
01:25:09,534 --> 01:25:13,001
¶ listen to
my heart break ¶

1644
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:16,234
¶ every time
she runs away ¶

1645
01:25:16,234 --> 01:25:19,500
¶ listen to
the banjo wind ¶

1646
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:23,134
¶ a sad song
drifting low ¶

1647
01:25:23,134 --> 01:25:25,467
¶ listen to
the tears roll ¶

1648
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:29,767
¶ down my face
as she turns to go ¶

1649
01:25:29,767 --> 01:25:32,834
¶ listen to the tears
as they roll ¶

1650
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:36,300
¶ down my face
as she turns to go. ¶

1651
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:49,567
Mr. Clayton,

1652
01:25:49,567 --> 01:25:52,634
I want you to know that

1653
01:25:52,634 --> 01:25:55,934
I've always felt not enough.

1654
01:25:55,934 --> 01:25:57,934
My dad

1655
01:25:57,934 --> 01:26:00,867
rides me all the time.

1656
01:26:00,867 --> 01:26:02,534
He calls me a loser.

1657
01:26:04,467 --> 01:26:07,134
I almost killed myself

1658
01:26:07,134 --> 01:26:09,433
until Kyle's note and book came out.

1659
01:26:11,101 --> 01:26:13,433
It saved my life.

1660
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,467
I know he's looking
down on you so proud.

1661
01:26:22,234 --> 01:26:24,034
Thanks, Pete.

1662
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:35,400
Thank you, Bruce Hornsby.

1663
01:26:36,867 --> 01:26:39,834
Welcome students, faculty

1664
01:26:39,834 --> 01:26:42,134
and guests.

1665
01:26:42,134 --> 01:26:44,134
Today

1666
01:26:44,134 --> 01:26:46,901
we celebrate Kyle.

1667
01:26:48,867 --> 01:26:51,367
Kyle has shown us
so many things;

1668
01:26:51,367 --> 01:26:53,567
How fleeting the time

1669
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:55,767
we spend on this earth
really is.

1670
01:26:55,767 --> 01:26:59,234
Kyle did not die in vain.

1671
01:26:59,234 --> 01:27:00,500
Through his book

1672
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,767
And through our hearts
he will live on.

1673
01:27:05,567 --> 01:27:08,634
Today we dedicate
this library

1674
01:27:08,634 --> 01:27:11,168
In his spirit.

1675
01:27:11,168 --> 01:27:14,101
A tribute to his deep
intelligence

1676
01:27:14,101 --> 01:27:18,234
and to the profound impact
he made on all of us

1677
01:27:18,234 --> 01:27:21,433
In the brief time we were fortunate
enough to know him.

1678
01:27:24,067 --> 01:27:26,600
And now to accept
this honor on his behalf,

1679
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,834
I give you his father

1680
01:27:28,834 --> 01:27:30,934
Mr. Lance Clayton.

1681
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,034
You guys didn't like Kyle.

1682
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:30,034
But that's okay, I didn't either.

1683
01:28:31,967 --> 01:28:34,433
I loved him.

1684
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:36,867
He was my son,

1685
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:40,300
But he was also a douche bag.

1686
01:28:44,834 --> 01:28:48,467
He wasn't very smart

1687
01:28:48,467 --> 01:28:50,700
And he didn't kill himself.

1688
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,500
Kyle died accidentally while masturbating.

1689
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,967
I made it look like a suicide

1690
01:29:04,967 --> 01:29:07,967
And I wrote a suicide note.

1691
01:29:12,867 --> 01:29:16,101
I also wrote his journal. Thank you.

1692
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:33,433
Thanks.

1693
01:29:33,433 --> 01:29:36,934
You are an asshole.

1694
01:29:36,934 --> 01:29:38,634
Yeah.

1695
01:29:38,634 --> 01:29:40,834
I used to think
the worst thing in life

1696
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,967
Was to end up all alone.

1697
01:29:42,967 --> 01:29:45,367
It's not.

1698
01:29:45,367 --> 01:29:47,801
The worst thing in life
is ending up with people

1699
01:29:47,801 --> 01:29:50,268
Who make you feel
all alone.

1700
01:29:50,268 --> 01:29:54,234
¶ pressure pushing down
