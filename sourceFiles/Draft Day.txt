1
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,804
Thirty-two teams, seven rounds,

2
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,605
224 young men who, today,

3
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:45,405
are about to become players in
the National Football League.

4
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,529
A day where lives are changed,

5
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,657
fates are decided,

6
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,655
dynasties are born,

7
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,285
and the clock is always ticking.

8
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,670
Of course,

9
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,747
I'm talking about...

10
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,571
Hello.

11
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,782
Yes, sir.

12
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,618
Sir?

13
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,703
What is it?

14
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,877
He's waiting in his office.

15
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,290
What time is it?

16
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,792
4:15.

17
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,173
What are we gonna do with it?

18
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,385
Well, we've gone over
this a lot, Walt.

19
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm really nervous about
trading away the top pick.

20
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,846
Callahan could be huge.

21
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,098
That's true.

22
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,100
But it might be worth it if
someone's willing to give us

23
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,644
their weight in gold to get him.

24
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,770
What'd the Rams get

25
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,480
when they traded away
number two overall

26
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,148
to the Redskins a few years back?

27
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,984
Three number one picks
and a number two.

28
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,820
Well, shit, that'd work for me.

29
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,072
Nobody's offering us that, Walt.

30
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,620
Look.

31
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,119
Do you want the entire city of
Seattle calling for our heads

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,214
because we didn't pick Bo Callahan?

33
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,626
Our fans know a good deal
when they see one, Tom.

34
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,212
Which is why we're not even
gonna think about doing this

35
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,755
unless we can find someone...

36
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,716
Stupid enough to give
us more than he should.

37
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,800
Exactly.

38
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,427
So,

39
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,853
who's the most desperate
guy you know?

40
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,567
We got a fun one
today, don't we, fellas?

41
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,818
Boom, more intrigue this year

42
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,153
than I can remember in a long time.

43
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,155
There's no intrigue
at the number one pick.

44
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,950
Bo Callahan, Wisconsin Badger,
overall number one to Seattle.

45
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,034
That's gotta be a slam dunk.

46
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,327
We haven't had a
quarterback like this

47
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,079
enter the Draft since Andrew Luck.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,456
Right, so you got
the Heisman Trophy winner

49
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,040
going to the Seahawks.

50
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,793
But what about the other 31 teams?
What are they gonna do?

51
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,378
Who you lookin' at today, Jon? Mel?

52
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,505
I think it's Cleveland
at number seven.

53
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,716
Sonny Weaver Jr., he's gotta have
a lot on his mind this year.

54
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,800
I'm with Mel.

55
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,512
As we all know, Sonny's dad, former
Browns coach Sonny Weaver Sr.,

56
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,098
he's a legend in Cleveland,
he died last week.

57
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,810
This kid, Ray Jennings,
Heisman Trophy finalist his senior year.

58
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,355
2,159 combined yards,
running the ball,

59
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,441
catching the ball, 22 touchdowns.

60
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,109
He's looking to take
it to the house.

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,029
The only downfall is this guy
got into a little skirmish.

62
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,032
Assault and battery, landed
a kid in the hospital.

63
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,494
But guess what? He was a
model citizen up until then.

64
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,704
And you guys know me.
I'm all about values.

65
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,706
And this kid's number
two on my board.

66
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,958
And when I look at that
incident, I kind of say, "Look.

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,251
"It's not medical,
it's not drug-related."

68
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,920
Good morning.

69
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,963
So if I got a kid at number two,

70
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,382
and he's slidin' down
towards number seven...

71
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,853
You look nice.

72
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,689
Are you gonna say anything to me?

73
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,942
Anything at all?

74
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,694
Well, it's big.

75
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,038
It's a pretty big thing
we're talkin' about here.

76
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,620
Look.

77
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,249
You can understand why
this week, of all weeks,

78
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,251
I might feel just a
little conflicted about

79
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,378
the news I'm suddenly
gonna be a dad.

80
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,796
I know.

81
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,765
Shit timing.

82
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,023
Hey!

83
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,906
Hey!

84
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,867
Where are you goin'?

85
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,827
I need to go to my
place before work.

86
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,788
Look, I'm, uh...

87
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,507
Shit.

88
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,513
Hey, Tom. You're up early.

89
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,307
Well, it is Draft Day.

90
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,892
How're you doin'?

91
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,393
Uh... Well, I'm great.
I'm havin' a great day.

92
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,644
How 'bout you?

93
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,398
Well, I'm sittin' here,
eatin' my pancakes,

94
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,233
thinkin' about movin' number one.

95
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,526
Really?

96
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:47,578
Yeah, as you know, Connors did
a great job for us last year.

97
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,533
But Callahan looks like...

98
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,743
Well, hell, Sonny, he's gonna be

99
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,078
a franchise player for someone.

100
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,956
You'd consider a trade?

101
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,300
I'd consider the right one.

102
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,799
Well, Jesus, Tom, at least act
like you called me, all right?

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,259
What do you want for it?

104
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,763
I want your first pick this year,
your first-rounder next year,

105
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,431
and your third-rounder
the year after that.

106
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,975
Ouch. Ouch. No, thanks.

107
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,060
I know what it sounds like...

108
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,895
It sounds like you're trying
to take advantage of me.

109
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,355
I would never do that.

110
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,106
Your seventh pick gives you, what?

111
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,733
A running back with a rap sheet?

112
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,234
You don't know who I'm
pickin' seven, Tom.

113
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,403
I'm not gonna sell the
farm for one guy.

114
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,905
Well...

115
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,209
You should. Your farm sucks.

116
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,077
Pick number one.

117
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,244
Get Bo Callahan.

118
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,329
I got a quarterback.

119
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,831
Brian Drew?

120
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,421
Are you talking about Brian Drew?

121
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,168
Jesus, you're hilarious.

122
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,795
Guy barely made it
through half the season

123
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,713
before gettin' injured last year.

124
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,882
I have the golden ticket, Sonny.

125
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,263
If I give it to you, you get
to save football in Cleveland.

126
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,357
You have 10 seconds, but
then I gotta go to work.

127
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,321
Enjoy your pancakes, Tom.

128
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,492
Folks, I believe
the word "Clevelander"

129
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,705
comes from the Latin word that means
"to have idiotic hope at all time,"

130
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,082
and don't we ever?

131
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,420
We don't have beaches and
beautiful weather and sunshine

132
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,006
and hot babes
roller-skating all over.

133
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,716
You know what we've got?

134
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,385
We got our sports teams.

135
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,012
And that's the only hope we have.

136
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,722
Let me explain to you.

137
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,642
Football was invented 20 miles
down the road in Canton, Ohio.

138
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,603
This is a football town.
It's in our DNA.

139
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,980
No doubt about it.

140
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,649
To me, losing the team altogether,

141
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,696
having the team go and move to
Baltimore, go there and win,

142
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,781
that was so painful for the town.

143
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,832
And then the new expansion
franchise having to come back in.

144
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,288
One of the amazing
things to me is that,

145
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,292
in the midst of all of this losing,
people are still hopeful that...

146
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:07,379
- Yeah.
- ...eventually, this is going to be our year.

147
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,133
Maybe to a fault, with the hope.
But that's really all we have.

148
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,344
- Because this is a sports town.
- And I want Sonny Weaver to know...

149
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,138
Sonny, I hope you're listening.
You better be.

150
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,601
Can you please do somethin' tonight
to turn this thing around?

151
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,322
- Otherwise, you will be gone.

152
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,898
Hello?

153
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,609
Good morning, Mr. Sonny Weaver Jr.

154
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,612
It's your number one
fan, Vontae Mack.

155
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,447
Vontae, how'd you get this number?

156
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,371
You gave it to me. At the Combine.

157
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,118
It's all right if I called?

158
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,620
That's all right.
It doesn't matter.

159
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,456
Vontae, the Draft doesn't
start until 8:00.

160
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,041
Where are you? New York?

161
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,542
Naw, man.

162
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,920
They wanted me up
there at Radio City,

163
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,594
but I wanted to be here in
Virginia with my grams.

164
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,718
Since she old, she
can't make that trip.

165
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,636
So?

166
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,846
Who you picking?

167
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,972
If I was you,

168
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,141
I'd take a lightning-quick
middle linebacker

169
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,690
who can murder the gaps in a 3-4.

170
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,062
Totally agree.

171
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,648
You got Reggie Wilson's
number down there in Purdue?

172
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,067
Now, I really don't
find that funny.

173
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,445
Yeah, it's funny, Vontae. You're
just not feelin' it right now.

174
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,615
Look, there's gonna be a lot of ups
and downs before this is all over.

175
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,700
Try and keep a sense of humor.

176
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,661
I ain't stupid.

177
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,623
You don't take me at seven,
I'll drop down to the late teens.

178
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,999
I watch the mock drafts!

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,211
I know who takin' who and I
can't afford to fall that far.

180
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,630
I can't take no
late-teens paycheck.

181
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,550
Vontae needs a seven-pick paycheck.

182
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,386
I got a gaggle of nephews
who need to get fed now.

183
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,720
I'm taking 'em tumblin'.

184
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,181
- Nephews, you love tumbling, yes or no?
- Yes!

185
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,308
See, that's the difference
between them and me.

186
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:48,814
I do not like tumblin'. Especially
if I'm tumbling 13 picks. Feel me?

187
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,190
Seventh pick...

188
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,238
Listen, I appreciate that,
Vontae, I really do.

189
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,153
- But I gotta go.
- Seventeen or 18...

190
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,871
Then I got tax...

191
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,292
Y'all ready to go?

192
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,376
Yes!

193
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,170
- Y'all ready to tumble?
- Yes!

194
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,421
- Yes?
- Yes!

195
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,299
That's what I want!

196
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,388
Hello?

197
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,223
Sonny. Earl Jennings.

198
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,102
- Hey, Earl. You're with your boy today?
- Yeah.

199
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,395
You guys in the Big Apple?

200
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,647
Listen, Sonny.

201
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,358
It's none of my business who
you draft today, all right?

202
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,487
Ray will play for
whoever wants him.

203
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,906
But if you're thinkin'
of pickin' him...

204
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,283
I need you to know that
I raised Ray right.

205
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,744
C'mon, Earl. I know
what the papers say.

206
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,213
I'll have him explain it to you.

207
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,915
What's goin' on, Mr. Weaver?

208
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,957
First of all,

209
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,168
I'm not in a gang.

210
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,462
The guys that were with
me, I grew up with them,

211
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,756
I've known 'em since I was a kid.

212
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,884
But the dudes we ran into,

213
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,304
they were big dudes,
and they came at us.

214
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,264
What was I supposed to
do, just stand there?

215
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,558
Well, they say you whooped
on that kid pretty good, Ray.

216
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,935
He's still in the hospital.

217
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,394
He's not a kid.

218
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,980
None of 'em were.
They were grown men.

219
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,482
They should have known
better, Mr. Weaver.

220
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,068
Well, that's not the point.

221
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,866
Did you hurt your hands?

222
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,864
You need your hands, Ray.

223
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,537
I know.

224
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,170
I just lost my head.

225
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,122
Did you find it?

226
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,165
Yes, sir.

227
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,001
Well, good. Now hold on
to it, you understand me?

228
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,503
Yes, sir.

229
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,214
Enjoy today, Ray.

230
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,424
You only get drafted once.

231
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,927
Yes, sir. I appreciate
that, Mr. Weaver.

232
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,695
Ah...

233
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,648
Jesus...

234
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,817
What? What'd he say?

235
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,489
I just wanna be a Brown.
Like you, Pop.

236
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,243
Yeah, I want that, too.

237
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,079
But you'll play where you play.
That's the way it works.

238
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,789
I know.

239
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,088
I'm just nervous, man.

240
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,087
You see that?
That's the Dungeon Drop.

241
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,673
Kids waited an hour to take it.

242
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:23,593
It's exactly 50 feet from the end
of the slide right into the pool.

243
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,137
Huge splash.

244
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,763
Anybody within shouting distance

245
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,598
would've gotten completely soaked.

246
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,767
And people pay for that.

247
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,187
I need you to make a splash,
Sonny. We need to sell tickets.

248
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,316
Well, I'm trying to help you do
that, Anthony, in my own way.

249
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,443
You can help me, by
makin' a splash.

250
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,738
And if you can't do it,
then I have to do it, and...

251
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,832
I don't wanna have
to do that, Sonny.

252
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,590
Just to be clear here, you're
threatening to fire me, right?

253
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,544
Let's talk about the Draft.

254
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,297
What do we need?

255
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,799
I hear a quarterback is
a good thing to have.

256
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,135
- We have Brian Drew.
- Well...

257
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,221
Word on Drew is that he's weak in
the knees. That's what I heard.

258
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,514
Well, that's because
you heard it from me.

259
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,974
We were 6-and-10 last season.

260
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,185
We were 5-and-1 until
Drew went down.

261
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,485
And he went down because
he's weak in the knees.

262
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,693
There's not a quarterback in
this draft after Callahan

263
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,446
that can make a difference
to our team, all right?

264
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,114
And we're way too far
down to get him.

265
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,616
Okay, okay. What else?

266
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,950
Our shiny new head coach

267
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,203
wants a shiny new running back.

268
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,127
Ray Jennings. He's
Cleveland royalty.

269
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,713
I know what Penn wants.

270
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,752
Come on, Anthony, you said
you would stay out of this.

271
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,712
Coach Penn has a Super Bowl ring.

272
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,214
He used to coach the
Cowboys, you know?

273
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,924
He took over for a team
that won the Super Bowl

274
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,926
and then proceeded to
run it into the ground.

275
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,225
Got himself fired. Lucky for us.

276
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,311
The Cowboys really
have great helmets.

277
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,982
Well, Anthony, you're the owner. You
can change the helmets if you want.

278
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,064
Look, you just gotta let me
do my job. I mean...

279
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,654
I like Vontae Mack.
He's special. He's different.

280
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,197
He could transform our
defense. Even as a rookie.

281
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,201
Defense doesn't make a splash.

282
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,584
Sonny.

283
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,010
People pay to get wet.

284
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,004
Shameful.

285
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,507
You're almost glad Coach
Weaver isn't around

286
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,218
to watch his son run this
team into the ground.

287
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,344
I mean, Tone, listen,

288
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,265
this guy comes two years after
supposedly saving San Francisco

289
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,934
and general manages us
right to a losing season.

290
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,564
Then you follow that up the next
season by firing his own father.

291
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,859
Coach Weaver, rest his soul.
Tone, he was football in...

292
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,576
- Have we tried everyone?
- Everyone worth asking.

293
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,375
So far, no one's
willin' to overpay.

294
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,210
Shit.

295
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,958
I really thought I could
get Sonny Weaver to bite.

296
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,501
I mean, he just lost his old man...

297
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,020
Fleece him.

298
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,060
Sonny! How can I help you?

299
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,731
Okay. I'm ready to do this, Tom.

300
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:29,080
Our next two number one picks and a
third-rounder for your pick today.

301
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,616
Correction. Your next
three first-round picks.

302
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,742
What?

303
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,335
You heard me.

304
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,583
You want me to give you

305
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,586
the Cleveland Browns' first-round
picks for the next three years?

306
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,962
That's right.

307
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,131
Well, that's insane, Tom. That...

308
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,591
That wasn't your offer.

309
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,301
Well, I changed my offer.

310
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,886
Hell, we live in a different world

311
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,429
than we did a couple of hours ago.

312
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,265
I made you a fair offer and you
told me to enjoy my pancakes.

313
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,976
You think I'm gonna give you my
next three number one picks?

314
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,562
You're panickin', Sonny, and I
intend to take advantage of that.

315
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,112
I'm not panicking.

316
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,530
Your next three first-round
picks. Yes or no?

317
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,626
You still there, Sonny?

318
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,339
It's fourth and forever.

319
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,424
I'm talking fourth
and, like, miles.

320
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,761
Fourth down and 26
yards to go, okay?

321
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,429
Everybody's dropped back deep.

322
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,181
Their safeties are
halfway to Abilene,

323
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,225
thinkin' they got this thing iced.

324
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,144
Everybody and their mother,
hell, their grandmothers,

325
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,648
think it's gonna be the deep ball,
the Long Bomb, the Hail Mary.

326
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,819
Instead, it's a toss out
to my man Ray Jennings.

327
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,945
And then, boom!

328
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,156
He gets swallowed up by this
huge, ugly nose tackle.

329
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,992
The Hee-ha or the Ho-ha.

330
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,828
One of those huge
Samoan kids, right?

331
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,871
And when he looks down,
guess what he sees?

332
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,498
Nothin'. 'Cause Ray ain't there.

333
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,708
You know where Ray is?

334
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:09,546
He teleported six feet to the
left and he's off to the races.

335
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,840
Every poor Sooner
bastard on the field

336
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,050
is soilin' his Pampers
tryin' to get to him.

337
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,012
What does Ray do?
He brings it back! He cuts!

338
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,932
Shimmy, shake-n-bake, and
hurdles over Kyle Danforth.

339
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,393
All-American Kyle Danforth
and he's ghost.

340
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,603
He's a good player.

341
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,939
67 yards. Touchdown. Ballgame.

342
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,524
I'm telling you guys.

343
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,776
Ray's dad was a special
player for the Browns,

344
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,862
but this kid might be even better.

345
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,238
'Morning, Sonny.

346
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,698
Good morning, guys.

347
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,450
Was just tellin' Jelly
Doughnut and the guys

348
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,076
my favorite Ray Jennings story

349
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,456
'cause they're tellin' me
we have not yet decided.

350
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,750
I mean, we're not seriously
considering anybody else, right?

351
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,423
What are you doing, Sonny?

352
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,589
I just made a trade
with the Seahawks.

353
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,342
For?

354
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,389
The number one pick.

355
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,269
Oh!

356
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,645
You got us Bo Callahan?

357
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,938
Certainly appears that way.

358
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,231
Ali, you here?

359
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,733
Yes.

360
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,903
Is this gonna screw us
up with the salary cap?

361
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,072
Moving from seven to one?

362
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,032
It's about another $1.5 million

363
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,450
we weren't anticipating
for this year.

364
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,625
Maybe an extra $5.5
million in signing bonus.

365
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,626
We have that?

366
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,123
We can make it work.

367
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,126
Let me get into it.

368
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,588
- Pretty good news, huh?
- Yeah!

369
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,591
Number one pick?

370
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,187
Pretty big! That's great!

371
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,268
I thought we had a QB.

372
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,487
Tell me, what did we give up?

373
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,483
A number one pick this year?

374
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,193
And?

375
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,611
First-round pick next year.

376
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,279
Okay, well, that's a lot, but
when you get a chance at

377
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,781
a player like Callahan...

378
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,825
And the year after that.

379
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,623
Three number ones?

380
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,288
You gave up three
consecutive first-rounders?

381
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,624
Sonny, that's our future.

382
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,875
No.

383
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,049
Bo Callahan's our future.

384
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,677
$30 million, Sonny.

385
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,215
Excuse me?

386
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,508
$30 million.

387
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,218
That's what you're paying
me to coach this team

388
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,553
for the next six years.

389
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,806
Did it cross your mind, did you
think it might be maybe important

390
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,401
to discuss this
decision with me first?

391
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,394
No.

392
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,647
It's my call.

393
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,484
As you can infer from
Coach Peon's reaction,

394
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,828
I just put all our
asses on the line

395
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,455
for a kid I think we all
agree is pretty good.

396
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,618
Until about 10 minutes ago,

397
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,495
I don't think any of us
thought this was possible,

398
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,664
and I seriously doubt that we have

399
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,167
looked at him the
way we might have.

400
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,378
That's my fault. All right,
guys? That's on me.

401
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,506
Now that's changed. So if
we go ahead with this,

402
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,341
if we pick him, and
find out tomorrow

403
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,012
that he has got knee problems,
he's got bedwetting problems,

404
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:07,015
or he's got goddamn OCD,
we're all gonna be fired.

405
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,984
What's beeping?

406
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,519
Hello?

407
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,943
Am I on the big phone?

408
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,026
Yes, Anthony, you're
on the big phone.

409
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,866
And can everybody hear me?

410
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,279
Good morning, Mr. Molina.

411
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,906
We can hear you.

412
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,034
Sonny! I'd like to
congratulate you.

413
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,379
I asked you to make a
splash and you did.

414
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,081
Is everybody still there?

415
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,709
Anthony, how do you
already know about this?

416
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,212
What can I tell you, my boy?
It's good to be the owner.

417
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,216
I'm about to board my plane.
I'm headin' for New York.

418
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,883
You're going to the Draft?

419
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,219
No, I'm gonna see Spider-Man,
Turn Off the Dark.

420
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,931
Of course I'm going to the
Draft! We got Bo Callahan!

421
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,224
Is that it?

422
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,726
Yes, sir.

423
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,603
Good.

424
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,396
Anthony? Anthony?

425
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,316
Sonny, my assistant Heather just
arrived from the equipment manager.

426
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,568
I had a jersey made
up for the young man.

427
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,239
I'm gonna hand it to him myself
personally when his name is announced.

428
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,116
Bo Callahan's gonna be
the son I never had.

429
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,743
Anthony, you already have a son.

430
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,917
Sonny, nice work!

431
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,166
Well, I guess that's settled.

432
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,502
Yeah. It may be.

433
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,629
We're still gonna have to
take another look at this kid

434
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,339
and everything there
is to know about him

435
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,808
before I can feel good
about what we just risked.

436
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,970
Meaning all of our jobs?

437
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,181
Yes. I do understand
how important it is,

438
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,766
but Mr. Weaver is
not here right now.

439
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,186
So the best I can do is, I can leave
him a message and get back to you.

440
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,729
Oh, you know, he
actually just walked in.

441
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,189
Can you hold for one
moment, please?

442
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,276
- Where's Ali?
- I don't know where Ali is.

443
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,361
She's not in her office. Ali!

444
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,114
I'm right here.

445
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,366
What's he doing here?

446
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,785
This is Rick. He's a new intern.

447
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,662
Yeah. We've met before, actually.

448
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,622
He'll be helping you today
because Rhona got mono.

449
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,126
I need Keith and Jeremy for
salary cap troubleshooting, so...

450
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,504
Um, I have Adam Schefter from ESPN
on the line. He heard a rumor.

451
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,507
Oh, great. Tell Schefter to
stick his rumor up his...

452
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,225
Sonny...

453
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,306
All right. Then tell him I'm not
taking any media calls right now.

454
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,390
Yes, sir.

455
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,017
And what kind of soda did you want?

456
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,643
I don't want a goddamn soda, Rich!

457
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,646
Don't yell at him. Thank you, Rick.

458
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,151
Listen, I know you're mad.

459
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,995
I'm not mad.

460
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,032
- And I'm sorry about the thing this morning.
- I'm not mad.

461
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,200
I understand the situation.

462
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,452
Whatever it is that you and I have,

463
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,495
you've been very clear
that it wasn't...

464
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,250
What are you talkin' about, "clear"?
I haven't been clear about anything.

465
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,843
Well...

466
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,676
Maybe that's the problem.

467
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,518
So, what did you have to give
up for the number one pick?

468
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,561
The first-round pick for
the next three years.

469
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,605
- Wow.
- Yeah, "wow."

470
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,274
The other one, you goat!
Get your head outta your ass!

471
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,525
What's going on?

472
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,735
Who the hell is this moron?

473
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,570
This is our new intern, Rick.
What do you want?

474
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,988
I need every tape of Callahan.

475
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,198
I have a call for Mr. Weaver.

476
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,533
And suddenly, every tape
of everyone is AWOL

477
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,826
and shit-show Johnny over here

478
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,536
doesn't have a goddamn
clue where they are!

479
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,580
Game tape is in the
archives. Chill out.

480
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,540
Chill out? They changed
the punch code!

481
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,251
Okay. I will get it, okay?
I will get the Callahan tapes.

482
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,378
For Christ sakes!

483
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,421
Just deal with the call
and handle lunch orders.

484
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,423
Don't ever speak to an
intern like that again.

485
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,926
Go back in the war room. Your
tapes will be here shortly.

486
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,804
Uh, Mr. Weaver.

487
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,304
What?

488
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,933
Chris Crawford is on line three.

489
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,558
Crawford!

490
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,394
How's my favorite super-agent?

491
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,270
I'm livin' the dream, Sonny Weave.

492
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,898
Dreamin' of a magical
wonderland called Cleveland

493
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,733
where my golden-armed quarterback

494
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,027
is gonna make all your
dreams come true.

495
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,113
Yeah. How is my favorite Badger?

496
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,490
He's doing great. He's excited.

497
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,826
You know, Bo loves Coach Penn.

498
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,079
He loves the Dawg Pound.

499
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,249
And did I mention that Bo loves
playin' in the cold weather?

500
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,793
'Cause Bo loves playin'
in the cold weather.

501
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,503
And we both know it's
cold in Cleveland.

502
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,588
I'd love to talk with him, Chris.

503
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,841
He's right here. Hold on.

504
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,599
Sonny Weaver. Cleveland.

505
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,099
How are you, Mr. Weaver?

506
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,810
I'm doin' fine. How are
you, son? Excited?

507
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:24,110
Well, of course I am.
It's an excitin' day. I can't lie.

508
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,525
Good, good. Well, try and
enjoy this part if you can.

509
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,694
You only get drafted once.

510
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,030
Well, thank you very much,
sir. I appreciate that.

511
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,114
Got a question for you, Bo.

512
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,458
Anything, Mr. Weaver. Fire away.

513
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,624
How important is winning to you?

514
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,455
Excuse me?

515
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,874
Well, I've seen all the tape on you

516
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,208
and talked to everyone
that matters,

517
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,544
but that's the thing
I still don't know.

518
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,298
How important is winning to you?

519
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,471
Well, winning is everything, sir.

520
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,888
Everyone says that, Bo.

521
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,357
I suppose they do, sir.

522
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,809
Look, I don't know
what else to tell you.

523
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,904
Winning is the only thing
that matters to me.

524
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,402
Oh, and by the way, I'd like to offer
my condolences for your father.

525
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,863
Thanks, Bo. Thanks for saying that.

526
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,656
Thank Chris for me.

527
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,075
Talk to you later, pal.

528
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,327
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Weaver.

529
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,120
Look forward to meetin' you, sir.

530
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,916
Great job.

531
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,000
Was I all right?

532
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,219
- Cleveland! Yeah.
- Cleveland.

533
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,841
Thank you.

534
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,677
Ali?

535
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,689
Great.

536
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,396
Hi, Mom.

537
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,566
You sold a cow for magic beans.

538
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,026
What?

539
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,737
You could have stole
Ray Jennings at seven!

540
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,698
How does the entire world
already know about this, Mom?

541
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,034
Because Vontae Mack
just tweeted it.

542
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,369
He tweeted it?

543
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,539
Yeah. Here.

544
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,709
"Agent just called. Browns
trade for number one.

545
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,922
"Sorry, Cleve.
You get Bo, no Vontae.

546
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,551
"Dumb move."

547
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,556
You're on Twitter?

548
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,562
You're not?

549
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,062
I'm sorry, Sonny.
Is this a bad time?

550
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,726
I gotta go, Mom.

551
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,229
This is the Draft Analysis
we've all been working on

552
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,272
for the last two months.

553
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,821
Fire! Ali! Fire!

554
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,901
- Ali! Fire!
- Did you hear that?

555
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,780
I'm coming. God!

556
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,331
Can I get you gentlemen
some coffee?

557
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,416
Love some.

558
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,959
Light and sweet, honey. Thanks.

559
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,758
Yeah, I'm not getting
you idiots anything.

560
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:58,134
I like her. Little Miss Salary Cap.
She's a sweetheart.

561
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,260
Yeah, she's the best.

562
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,434
Why am I here, Sonny?

563
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,431
Because Molina thinks
you coached the Cowboys.

564
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,807
I did coach the Cowboys.

565
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,356
And I think you were
a bad babysitter.

566
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,315
You know, my wife loved
livin' in Dallas, Sonny.

567
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,108
It's a rich town
full of fancy people

568
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,943
and she likes that kind of thing.

569
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,029
So she wasn't exactly
thrilled when I said,

570
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,699
"Hey, baby, pack your bags.
We're moving to Cleveland."

571
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,618
Well, there's fancy
people here, too.

572
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,994
No.

573
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,496
There's really not.
Which is okay by me.

574
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,874
But I dragged my pretty
wife to this town

575
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,084
because this city
deserves a championship

576
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,503
and I'm the guy that
can deliver it.

577
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,588
Well, then we're on
the same page, Vince.

578
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,672
Oh, yeah?

579
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,174
Then keep me in the loop.

580
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,009
There is no loop. All right?

581
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,762
There's me doing my
job, you doing yours.

582
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,222
Your job is to coach
the team I give you.

583
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,473
They do it different in Dallas?

584
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,103
Yeah, they do. They win. A lot.

585
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,648
I had my choice of teams to coach,
Sonny, and I chose this team, okay?

586
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,067
I chose to coach this team.

587
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,903
Not the team you're puttin'
together in your head, on the fly

588
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,655
'cause your old man died last week

589
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,829
and you're tapping
one of your execs.

590
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,992
What did you just say?

591
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,871
I'm sorry. Is that
supposed to be a secret?

592
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:14,090
You know, around here, we called
my "old man" Coach Weaver.

593
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,421
And yes, my father died last week.

594
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,173
So the next time you
refer to his name,

595
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,841
next time you say it, at
least, in front of me,

596
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,846
you say it with some goddamn
reverence, because he earned it.

597
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,228
Fair enough?

598
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,780
Keep your legs up now.

599
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,274
Don't even think about it.

600
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,910
Sonny Weaver Jr.

601
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,748
Vontae.

602
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,451
I'm disappointed in
you, Mr. Weaver.

603
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,577
Let me tell you something, Vontae,

604
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,704
and I don't have a lot of time,

605
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,299
so I want you to listen
to me carefully, okay?

606
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,375
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

607
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,876
Don't Twitter.

608
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,546
For the love of Jesus, just stop.

609
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:02,508
Delete your profile. Get off the web.
Do not do this to yourself.

610
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,260
I don't know why you
care what I do.

611
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,220
I can do whatever I want. Right?

612
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,888
Of course you can, Vontae,

613
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,473
but every GM in the league
has now read your tweet,

614
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,642
or whatever they call them,

615
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,894
and they've all made a mental
note that Vontae Mack,

616
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,565
however prodigiously talented, is a
guy who likes to talk, all right?

617
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,066
Who likes to spread rumors,

618
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,735
who's more than willing
to announce to the world

619
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:24,456
any inane thought that
passes through his head.

620
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,365
And be it your God-given
right or not,

621
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,825
Vontae, GM's hate
that shit, all right?

622
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,951
We hate it.

623
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,911
You made a mistake, Mr. Weaver.

624
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,663
No, Vontae. I made a deal.

625
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,415
And you're gonna be a
great player in the NFL

626
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,042
if you don't manage
to sabotage yourself

627
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,626
between now and the
end of this day.

628
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,254
Now, now, now, now,
that boy you wanna take,

629
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,090
that there is a mistake, Callahan.

630
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,592
Callahan's a poser.

631
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,676
Yeah.

632
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:50,097
And what do you know that every
scout and coach on Earth does not?

633
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,317
I know he got sacked
12 times last year.

634
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,853
No. It was 11. It was 11 times.

635
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,689
Yeah, well, four of 'em
were mine. In one game.

636
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,025
Yeah, I remember.
I saw your highlight reel.

637
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,444
I also remember that he beat you.

638
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,447
Watch it again.

639
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,199
Don't watch me. Watch him.

640
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,494
Watch me sack him four
times in one game.

641
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,794
Then watch what happens after.

642
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,052
Watch what happens after what?

643
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,508
Just watch.

644
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,808
Jesus Christ.

645
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,022
Jordan, come here.

646
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,077
Do it like you did it at home.

647
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,370
Yeah! Nice, nice, nice!

648
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,912
'Morning, boss man.

649
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,665
Tony Bagel. How's my
favorite strength coach?

650
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,333
Hey, boss. Boss.

651
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,085
Did you hear about Brian Drew?

652
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,336
No, what about him?

653
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,422
He came in here yesterday,
did a little workout.

654
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,382
Guess how much he squatted?

655
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,591
He's not supposed to be squattin'.

656
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,926
Four hundred!

657
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,886
Four bills! I know!

658
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,347
And what's even more
impressive is his arm.

659
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,057
Your star wide
receiver Andre Bello's

660
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,642
been tellin' me about
those secret workouts

661
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,602
they've been doin'
together all winter.

662
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,271
You know about those?

663
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,439
Yeah.

664
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,025
Yeah, well, Andre thinks Brian can
throw a good 15 yards deeper now.

665
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,195
I didn't believe it until
I saw what he benched.

666
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,405
What did he bench?

667
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,783
He benched 250, 25 times.

668
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,035
Just boom-boom!

669
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:39,540
Translation, Brian Drew's in
the best shape of his life.

670
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,208
- Good work.
- Yeah!

671
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,043
Let's go for it, boy. C'mon!

672
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,420
Pop it!

673
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,219
Snap it up! Yeah! Nice!

674
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,425
- This one...
- Yeah... Oh my God, she's hot.

675
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,551
I like the one in the red.

676
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,599
She's a babe!

677
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,806
How we doin' on Callahan?

678
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,266
You mean in the
weakness department?

679
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,061
Yeah, well, he has a weakness
for banging hot chicks, Sonny.

680
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,771
I mean, look, he has
a whole website

681
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:44,939
dedicated to all the
chicks he's smashed.

682
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,783
All right, c'mon.

683
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,320
Somebody's gotta have something.

684
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,615
He doesn't speak French real
good. He got a C-minus.

685
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,158
And he used to bite
his fingernails,

686
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,701
but then wait for it,
now he doesn't anymore.

687
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,495
But, Sonny, really, how
many chicks do you think

688
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,289
a guy like that sleeps with,
per week, on average?

689
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,291
We were thinkin' 20.
Minimum. Minimum.

690
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,376
I say 10.

691
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,962
That's 1.5 per day,
which makes sense.

692
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,922
- 2.5 sounds exorbitant.
- Listen, man.

693
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,674
Speaking as a former college
quarterback myself...

694
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,758
Division II.

695
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,510
I say he averages,
like, three per day.

696
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,888
Right? That's one in the mornin'...

697
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,850
I'm trying very hard
to not completely

698
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,186
lose my shit on all
three of you right now,

699
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,655
but you're not makin' it easy.

700
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,734
Sonny, so far, he's still the
best prospect we've ever seen.

701
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,986
Easily, Sonny.

702
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,988
We've been looking, Sonny. I swear.

703
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,906
We couldn't find anything
before and we can't now.

704
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,324
No other team could either.

705
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,243
If Callahan can't play
football, nobody can.

706
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,419
I get it. I get it. But
look, nobody's perfect.

707
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,044
Everybody has something.
Even the great ones. Right?

708
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,295
They said that Montana
was too small,

709
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,380
that he'd get hurt,
he'd get banged up,

710
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,600
but that didn't seem
to matter, did it?

711
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,179
A lot of people said that
Elway was too strong,

712
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,850
that he threw too hard,
didn't have touch,

713
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,274
but that didn't seem to
matter either, did it?

714
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,188
And pretty much everyone agreed

715
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,565
that Peyton didn't
have the arm strength,

716
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,774
that he couldn't throw deep.

717
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,860
But somehow, none of
it seemed to matter.

718
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,533
You get where I'm going here, guys?

719
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,033
We need to find out what Bo
Callahan's "something" is.

720
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,035
Then figure out if
it matters or not.

721
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,413
All right? Figure out if it's
somethin' we can live with.

722
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,632
- We're on it, Sonny.
- All right, Sonny.

723
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,215
Yo, I bookmarked that page.

724
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,428
I really like this
quarter outta Oklahoma.

725
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,551
His Combine scores
were off the charts.

726
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,059
Hey, Sonny.

727
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,062
What's up?

728
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,230
Got a question for you,
Tom. Straight up.

729
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,273
Sure.

730
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,401
Why'd you make the deal?

731
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,111
What?

732
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,490
This morning, for Callahan.
Why did you make that deal?

733
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,700
The same reason you did.

734
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,452
It's the best thing
for my franchise.

735
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,412
What knock did you
find on Callahan?

736
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,622
Bo! We want Bo!

737
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,500
Son of a bitch.

738
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,668
You all right, Tom?
You seem distracted.

739
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,252
We didn't find anything on him.

740
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,754
I'm sure you guys haven't either.

741
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,340
Come on, I already made the
trade. I'm living with that, Tom.

742
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,508
I'm not gonna hold it against you.

743
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,676
Tom must go!

744
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,344
- Tom must go!
- I'd just appreciate it if you could...

745
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,267
Sonny, I gotta go.

746
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,599
Hey.

747
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,774
I got you Bo Callahan's
scouting reports.

748
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,356
Dave, come here.

749
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,655
Does that look like me?

750
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,036
- What are you doing?
- Just...

751
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,883
I need two seconds with you in
a place that isn't out there.

752
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,719
Okay.

753
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,889
I don't like what's
happening between us.

754
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,674
Seeing you all day,
walk the other way,

755
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,092
watching you drive
away this morning,

756
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,594
it's killing me.

757
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,807
Look, I know I've disappointed you.

758
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,394
And maybe that's not even
a strong enough word.

759
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,020
If I didn't handle, if I
didn't have the right words

760
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,314
that you needed to
hear, then I'm...

761
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,483
Look, Sonny, you don't
need to do this.

762
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,985
Let me finish.

763
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,319
Men are supposed to step up.

764
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,988
And in the middle of
everything that's going on,

765
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,531
I didn't get it right, all right?

766
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,032
I didn't get all gooey.

767
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,409
I didn't jump up and want to know

768
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,702
what color to paint the bedroom,

769
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,828
you know, blue or pink.

770
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,497
And I wish I was one
of those kind of guys

771
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,459
that know how to make
the wallpaper line up.

772
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,169
The Home Depot
Dads-of-the-Year types

773
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,005
that make the rest of
us look like assholes.

774
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:41,601
Those guys are not the reason
you look like an asshole.

775
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,265
So I didn't react the
perfect way this morning.

776
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,601
I shouldn't be penalized for that.

777
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,025
I know that, Sonny.

778
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,117
I'm not the Mom-of-the-Year
type either.

779
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,279
I don't know how to pack a lunch.
I've never changed a diaper.

780
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,408
And God help me, the one thing I
do understand, Sonny, is football.

781
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:06,950
That's me.

782
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,546
I'm action-oriented.
I'm passionate.

783
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:14,217
I'm a Cleveland girl,
and I am football.

784
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,712
Maybe more than you.
I wasn't born into this game.

785
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,681
I had to fight my way in.

786
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,767
Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.
I can come back.

787
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,060
I'm gonna come back.

788
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,653
What do you need, Rick?

789
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,574
Brian Drew just
trashed your office.

790
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,569
What?

791
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,612
I told him you were busy

792
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,658
and he told me to have
intercourse with my mother.

793
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,245
Which... You know, she passed
away, so... I didn't tell him that.

794
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,997
Anyway, he got really mad and
started throwing stuff around,

795
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,751
and then he said he was gonna
go down to the locker room.

796
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,420
After all that rehab, you're just gonna
quit? You're just gonna walk away?

797
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,922
C'mon, Brian. Don't listen
to Coach. Don't leave.

798
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,090
I know what's goin' on here.

799
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,685
Then just compete with him!
Beat him out!

800
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,435
Did you trash my office?

801
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,770
Trade me.

802
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,814
Did you just trash my office?

803
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,983
Yeah. I'm upset.

804
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,150
Well, I don't care if you're upset.

805
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,944
If you're upset, call
your agent, all right?

806
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,154
Let him have this conversation.
That's what he's there for.

807
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,657
No, Sonny. You're gonna talk to me.
Man-to-man. You owe me that.

808
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,992
I owe you?

809
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,118
I drafted you.

810
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,578
Your dad drafted me.

811
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,456
No, Drew, I drafted you.

812
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,541
I may have been in San Francisco,

813
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,670
but my dad wasn't even looking
at you until I told him to.

814
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:44,298
Yeah, and when your knee crapped
out and no one wanted you,

815
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,591
I still extended your contract,

816
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,800
and I think I even
gave you a raise,

817
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,518
because I believed in you.

818
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,729
Then why pick Callahan?

819
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,019
You know why.

820
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,651
Then trade me.

821
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm gonna do what's
best for the team.

822
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:03,901
I've been in this league for eight
seasons. I've been to the playoffs.

823
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,904
I know the system that Penn wants to
run and I know I can make it work.

824
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,657
I've busted my ass this off-season.
I set the bar high.

825
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,002
I'm in great shape.
I feel 10 years younger.

826
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,705
I'm tellin' you,
man, I swear to you,

827
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:20,050
the best thing for this
team, this season, is me.

828
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,919
Are you finished?

829
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,421
No.

830
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,221
Well, get finished.

831
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,674
And then get back to work.

832
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,178
If I trade you, I trade you.
And if I don't, I don't.

833
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,681
Do yourself a favor. Worry about
Brian. Don't worry about Bo.

834
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,559
And definitely, most absolutely
goddamn importantly,

835
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,853
do not bother me with your
shit right now, Brian.

836
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,197
I'm workin' here!

837
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,713
Ali!

838
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,974
Ali!

839
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,719
Did you hear me, Rick?

840
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,388
I heard you. Yeah.

841
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,764
Do you think Ali heard me?

842
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,892
No, I don't think so. No.

843
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,070
Good answer.

844
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,232
Women are tricky. Problem is,
they're smarter than us.

845
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,484
Yeah. Women, they're like...

846
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,844
This is Sonny.

847
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,179
Hey, Sonny. It's Pete
Begler with the Chiefs.

848
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,932
Hey, Pete. What's up?

849
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,100
Well, we're in the market for a QB,

850
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,185
and now that you have number one,

851
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,939
I was wondering if Brian
Drew's available.

852
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,649
I don't know. Haven't
made up my mind yet.

853
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,109
Is he healthy?

854
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,821
Well, if you're askin' about his
knee, it's stronger than ever.

855
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,532
He's throwin' the ball a good 15
yards farther down the field.

856
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,659
Okay. Just confirming.

857
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,287
His agent sent over a tape of Drew
working out during the off-season.

858
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,122
We like what we see.

859
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,624
He did? That's great.

860
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,843
You seem surprised.

861
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,140
Why would I be surprised?

862
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,384
Okay, Sonny. You don't have
to play games with me.

863
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,809
What do you want for him?
I'm all ears. Let's talk.

864
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,641
Pete, we're still working
out some stuff over here.

865
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,934
Can I get back to you?

866
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,144
Okay.

867
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,897
Thanks.

868
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,072
Hey, Ali. How're you doin'?

869
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,656
Are you as jacked as everyone else

870
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,241
around here about
gettin' the first pick?

871
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,836
I don't really get jacked,
I just manage the cap.

872
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:01,995
Uh-huh.

873
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,873
How does a girl like you
get in this game anyway?

874
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,249
Law school.

875
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,709
Lawyer.

876
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,669
So you don't get excited
about anything.

877
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,712
If I do my job

878
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,672
and we haven't spent
more than $125 million

879
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,591
on players by the time
the season starts,

880
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,685
I get excited.

881
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,059
Mind if I sit down?

882
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,604
- I'm busy.
- Won't take long.

883
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,945
I could use your help.

884
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,821
Mmm?

885
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,857
The Browns brought me to Cleveland

886
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,453
so that everybody could
get one of these.

887
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,364
How is it that the ultimate prize

888
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,533
in the most macho
sport ever invented

889
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,036
is a piece of jewelry?

890
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:48,375
Yeah. Well, be that as it may,
I need some draft picks back, okay?

891
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,293
'Cause there's been some
pretty foolish moves

892
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,387
made by your boyfriend.

893
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,049
- My boyfriend?
- Please.

894
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,927
You have his ear. I don't.

895
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,887
Talk to him. It's not about me.

896
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,311
It's about the people of Cleveland.

897
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,060
You don't think Callahan's legit?

898
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,729
I think Callahan might be the
best prospect in the Draft.

899
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,190
But I hate rookie quarterbacks.

900
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,359
They're stupid and they're scared.

901
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,570
- Not the good ones.
- We already got a good one.

902
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,240
His name is Brian Drew. He can
run my offense like a pro.

903
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,742
So I'm tryin' to
figure out why I gotta

904
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,327
give away the future
of the franchise

905
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,705
and then sit around trying
to teach some rookie,

906
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,498
I don't know, everything, you know?

907
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,750
I'm talking shifts,
plays, protections,

908
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,961
snap counts, alerts,
check-with-me's,

909
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:36,464
Double X, jet, ice cream, 36, counter
naked waggle at 16-9 Tennessee Free.

910
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,966
Know what I'm sayin'?

911
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:41,141
Don't patronize me. You know
I know what you're saying.

912
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,599
I dedicated my life to
this sport, just like you.

913
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,195
And, no, I will not
speak to Sonny for you.

914
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,871
Bo Ridley Callahan.

915
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,281
He's an only child.

916
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:04,451
His mom's a homemaker, his father's
a medical malpractice lawyer.

917
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,785
He's made some money.

918
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,830
Pays his taxes. He's got three
years left on his mortgage.

919
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,292
The kid's pretty vanilla. Belonged
to a few clubs in high school.

920
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,794
He had a walk-on role
in Damn Yankees.

921
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,839
He was on the honor roll from
junior high through college.

922
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,508
Kept his nose clean,
he worked out and...

923
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,886
Well, you know, he threw a football

924
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:26,806
better than anybody in the great
states of Washington or Wisconsin.

925
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,058
But?

926
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,184
How do you know there's a "but"?

927
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,312
Because you're an
unoriginal bastard, Ralph.

928
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,564
So, go on. But...

929
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,693
But during his final
year at Wisconsin,

930
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,821
he had a big dinner for his 21st
birthday at some restaurant.

931
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,200
Locals find out who the dinner's
for, and they start filin' in.

932
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,160
Things get outta control.

933
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,120
Manager called the
cops when somebody

934
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,581
broke in his office
and stole some money.

935
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,667
Of course, none of
this is Bo's fault.

936
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,418
'Course.

937
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,920
But...

938
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:01,591
But the cops came and they took
everybody's name regardless.

939
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,220
It was a few hundred people.
Standard operating procedure.

940
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,722
But...

941
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,684
Ask me who wasn't there.

942
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,686
Who wasn't there, Ralph?

943
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,860
Any of his teammates.

944
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:20,285
None of his teammates came to the
poor guy's birthday party, Sonny.

945
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,957
Dick Moore.

946
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,376
Hey, Coach. Sonny Weaver.

947
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,254
You're about to be
a very happy man.

948
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:42,257
Bo Callahan's some
of my finest work.

949
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,217
What can you tell me about him?

950
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:48,054
I can tell you what I just told
you, he's some of my finest work.

951
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,556
Anything else?

952
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,274
You have the tapes.

953
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,601
He's the real deal, Sonny.

954
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,230
Don't overthink this like
your dad would have.

955
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,482
No offense.

956
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,276
Look. I love Bo.

957
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,153
My coaches love him.

958
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,322
The cheerleaders love him.
The fans love him.

959
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,574
Everyone loves him.

960
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,794
Then how come none of his teammates
went to his birthday party?

961
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,673
Are you kiddin' me with this?

962
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,167
Seems relevant.

963
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,586
You want to tear this
kid down, or what?

964
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,089
No, I'd just like your take on it.

965
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,090
I find it odd that
nobody on the team

966
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,760
was at their teammate's
21st birthday party.

967
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,430
I don't know, Sonny. What do
you think's more plausible?

968
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,766
That nobody on an 85-person squad

969
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,645
attended a party
thrown by the captain?

970
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,854
Or could it be that when
the cops got to the place

971
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,899
and realized that my boys
had done nothin' wrong,

972
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,360
decided not to take down
any of the players' names

973
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,444
because they didn't wanna jam up

974
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,039
a bunch of good kids
for doin' nothin'?

975
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,125
Oh, wait. Wait a minute.

976
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,128
Your theory seems right.

977
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,129
Bo Callahan.

978
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:59,719
Bo Callahan hasn't got any friends.

979
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,296
Good luck with the Draft today.

980
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,842
C'mon, you guys. You're
lookin' pathetic.

981
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,669
Hey, Max.

982
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,172
Hey, Sonny. Hope you're holdin' up.

983
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,599
I got an offer for number one.

984
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,685
Yeah? Well, I'm all ears.
What do you have in mind?

985
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,429
Okay, here's what we got.

986
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,181
Maurice Castillo, Antonio Taylor,

987
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,268
our first-rounder next year
and the year after that.

988
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,728
That's two number ones,
a blue-chip running back...

989
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,355
I know who they are, Max.

990
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,779
Then you know it's a fair offer.

991
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,905
I'm intrigued.

992
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,708
Good. Let's make a deal.

993
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,703
- Well, you gotta give me some time.
- Time?

994
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:19,414
Sonny, time's one thing
neither one of us have.

995
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,623
Make the deal.

996
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,216
Give me an hour.

997
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,970
We'll give you half that.

998
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,927
What's up?

999
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,138
I just got off the
phone with Max Stone.

1000
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,557
Yeah? How are things in Buffalo?

1001
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,058
Well, I guess you
didn't ask him then,

1002
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,186
when you called him behind my back.

1003
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,812
Max is an old friend of mine.

1004
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,440
He calls me up to congratulate
us on the Callahan thing

1005
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,609
and I express my
opinions on the matter.

1006
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,908
He call you, or you call him?

1007
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,405
It's such a crazy day.
Who remembers?

1008
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,865
Yeah, well, how 'bout
try and remember this,

1009
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,493
I can and I will fire your ass.

1010
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,995
Then do it, Sonny.

1011
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,083
You actually think
I'm gonna give up

1012
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,127
Bo Callahan for
Taylor and Castillo?

1013
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,171
Hmm? Maurice Castillo?

1014
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,672
And draft picks, okay?

1015
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,757
Don't forget the
draft picks, Sonny.

1016
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,056
You do remember what
those are, right?

1017
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,514
All right. Look. It's...

1018
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,599
On the surface, it's not
a terrible trade, but

1019
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,768
why do you think we
need to do this now?

1020
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,103
Because you burned up any currency
this team had this morning.

1021
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,980
Now you have the opportunity
to build it back up.

1022
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,607
And I don't know what your
problem is with Maurice.

1023
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,983
He's a beast.

1024
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,818
Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.

1025
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,779
Your opinion. He
plays in my system.

1026
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,821
He doesn't block!

1027
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,782
I don't need him to block.
I need him to run.

1028
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,700
Which he does, like
a bat outta hell.

1029
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,453
Which takes the pressure
off my offense, okay?

1030
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:45,050
I got 52 Tarzans in that locker
room. I could use a Jane.

1031
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,383
You should at least seriously
consider what I'm saying.

1032
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,013
All right. Get me the
numbers on all their guys.

1033
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,807
We got about 25 minutes
to see what's what.

1034
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,275
Great.

1035
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,946
Mr. Molina. How are you?

1036
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,075
Very good.

1037
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,544
Excellent. That's good.
Good to see you.

1038
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,667
I'll take you inside.

1039
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,877
Right up here.

1040
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,754
Sonny call you yet?

1041
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,172
Oh, not yet.

1042
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,215
What's he doing?

1043
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,925
Well, I'm sure he's
gonna call soon.

1044
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,678
These are our team reps.
This is Wyndham. This is Phil.

1045
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,513
- Mr. Anthony Molina.
- How do you do?

1046
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,348
- Sir.
- How do you do?

1047
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,516
Right up here.

1048
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,601
I'm not sitting here.

1049
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,685
Oh, no, of course you're not.

1050
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,604
You're with the Commissioner,
up in his lounge.

1051
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:50,699
Here, let me show you the way.
Let's go around here.

1052
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,702
He's even better.

1053
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:57,202
Mr. Commissioner?

1054
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,740
Hey, Anthony. How are you doing?

1055
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,908
What are you doing in my lounge?

1056
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,620
You guys sure made
tonight a lot more exciting.

1057
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,746
Thanks for inviting me in.

1058
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:05,955
Enjoy it. Good luck.

1059
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,582
- Will do.
- Okay.

1060
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,876
Can we talk football?

1061
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,711
Just football, for 30 seconds?

1062
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,464
We can always talk football.

1063
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,217
There's a deal on the
table from Buffalo.

1064
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,970
I heard.

1065
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,555
What's the war room think?

1066
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,182
Split.

1067
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,142
Penn wants me to do it.

1068
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,895
But you don't?

1069
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,062
I don't.

1070
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,229
Why?

1071
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,856
Because I know, in
my heart and my gut,

1072
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,399
that if I make this
trade with Buffalo,

1073
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,903
then I don't get to
make a pick this year.

1074
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,572
All I get back are
future draft picks

1075
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,997
for the guy that Molina
brings in to replace me.

1076
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,002
I've been here two years, Ali.

1077
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,590
Two years.

1078
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,797
I've never gotten a chance to

1079
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,926
see what a team I put
together can do out there.

1080
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,146
First year, it's my dad's team.

1081
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,766
Last year, Drew goes down
before I can see what we had.

1082
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,144
Then I get stuck with Penn,

1083
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,441
who I'm still trying to
figure out how to work with.

1084
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:16,948
This is finally supposed
to be my season.

1085
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:22,287
I just want the team
that I want. One time.

1086
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,577
So why are you bugging
me if you already know?

1087
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,460
I don't know.

1088
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,387
I'm makin' mistakes.

1089
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,219
Remember the '89 Super Bowl?

1090
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,472
49ers-Bengals.

1091
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,183
Niners down by three,
3:20 left in the game.

1092
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:53,312
93-yard winning drive, Taylor beats
the weak safety for a 10-yard TD.

1093
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:56,407
Yeah, but before the drive.

1094
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,820
Joe Montana's in the huddle. Right?

1095
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,780
And unbelievably, somehow spots

1096
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,824
the actor John Candy in the stands.

1097
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,827
He points at him and asks
the guys in the huddle,

1098
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:11,332
"Hey, isn't that John Candy?"

1099
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,668
They couldn't believe
the balls on him.

1100
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:19,093
To be that calm, in that
game, at that moment.

1101
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,015
His guys instantly
relax, they march...

1102
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,012
93 yards.

1103
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,431
93 yards.

1104
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,855
Montana throws a little
slant to Taylor.

1105
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,445
49ers win the Super Bowl.

1106
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,189
Great game.

1107
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,408
It was a great game.

1108
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,038
No one can stop a ticking clock.

1109
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,461
But the great ones,

1110
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,212
the great ones always find
a way to slow it down.

1111
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,045
So slow it down, Sonny.

1112
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,225
Okay. I made a decision.

1113
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,471
It's still Callahan. Let's
inform Buffalo that it's a no.

1114
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,224
That is beautiful.

1115
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,891
Okay, Sonny. We're with you.

1116
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,226
Like hell we are.

1117
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:16,062
All due respect, Sonny,
that is a bonehead move.

1118
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,564
Maybe so, but we're
back on Callahan.

1119
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,567
Do me a favor. Let's put up the
Wisconsin-Ohio State footage.

1120
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,735
Yeah, sure thing, Sonny.

1121
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,612
We've seen that footage,
like, two million times.

1122
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:27,031
What are you hopin' to find in
it that we haven't seen already?

1123
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,366
I'm just double-checking something.

1124
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,408
All right. Here we go.

1125
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,958
All right, roll it down to
the first time Vontae sacks Bo.

1126
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,131
All right. Here we go.

1127
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,294
Damn. He shook off two
blockers like they were rag dolls.

1128
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,754
And then Bo walks into a bear hug.

1129
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,130
Vontae wrapped him up pretty good.

1130
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,674
Yeah, Bo's hard to sack.

1131
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,473
He was one of the least-sacked
QBs in Division I last year.

1132
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,178
Go to the next play.

1133
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,596
The next sack?

1134
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,350
No. The next play after this one.

1135
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,856
What's he doing?

1136
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:03,359
He got flustered. Didn't wait
for the play to develop.

1137
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,944
Not Bo's finest moment.

1138
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,697
No. Whatever, it's one play.

1139
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,200
Take us down to Vontae's next sack.

1140
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,663
Ooh!

1141
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,372
Oh, man, that is sick!

1142
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,792
He absolutely bull-rushed that right
tackle. Bo didn't even have a chance.

1143
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,137
Yeah, I gotta give it to the kid.
He's got a wicked first step.

1144
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,723
- See what he does on the next play.
- All right.

1145
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,846
Speed kills. Look at that.

1146
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,639
Yeah, look at that.
He gets frantic.

1147
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,349
My favorite thing about rookie QBs.

1148
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,894
They get frantic when they
think they're gonna get hit.

1149
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:38,978
Although I gotta give him credit.

1150
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,521
Barrio' those two plays,
he was brilliant.

1151
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,400
He threw four TDs, including
the last one to win it.

1152
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,944
Take us down to that.

1153
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,446
Yeah.

1154
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,746
Looking downfield, staying calm.

1155
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,414
Sonny, this guy's textbook.

1156
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,959
Man, this kid is
strong. That's impressive.

1157
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,306
That's pure Roethlisberger.
He's pro-ready. End of story.

1158
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,174
Take it back.

1159
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:12,138
Rewind that back to the
start of the play.

1160
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,348
Just stop right here.

1161
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,681
What's missing?

1162
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,807
Fullback.

1163
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,309
But Wisconsin runs most of their

1164
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,019
passing plays out of
an empty backfield.

1165
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,363
No, not what I'm
lookin' at. Try again.

1166
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,152
Where's Vontae?

1167
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,281
You know what, Sonny?
I think he got ejected.

1168
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,200
- He got ejected from the game?
- Yeah.

1169
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,284
For what?

1170
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,119
Yeah, in the third
quarter, after he stripped

1171
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,038
the ball from Callahan
and scored that TD.

1172
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,539
He gave the ball to a fan.

1173
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,375
When he got flagged
for it, he went nuts,

1174
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,168
touched the refs. So
they threw him out.

1175
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,003
Bonehead move.

1176
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,676
Let's see that.

1177
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,490
This is college. What's
he thinkin', you know?

1178
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,745
See? That's it.

1179
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,037
There you go.

1180
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,498
He was showing off. You
can't do that in college.

1181
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,797
You can't hand the
ball to some girl.

1182
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,879
That's not some girl.

1183
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,428
That's not some girl, guys.
That's his sister.

1184
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,264
She died about six months later.

1185
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,268
Boo-friggin'-hoo.

1186
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,561
We ain't runnin' an
after-school special here.

1187
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,312
We're runnin' a football team,

1188
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,733
whose offense was ranked 28th
in the league last year.

1189
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,907
And I still need a runnin' back.

1190
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,469
What can I say, Rich?

1191
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,305
I love being here,
I love feeling the energy,

1192
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,807
and I love having the
number one pick.

1193
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,392
I hope that you would
love having it,

1194
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,478
because you sure gave
up a ton to get it.

1195
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,605
For the record,
I didn't do anything.

1196
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,482
And "ton" is a relative word.

1197
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,566
Playing coy. I like it.

1198
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,818
Come on, just between two
guys, forget the cameras,

1199
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,612
who're you gonna take,
number one overall?

1200
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:38,616
Well, I think it would be
unsportsmanlike, spoil the surprise.

1201
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,961
Anthony Molina. Not
giving me anything.

1202
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,249
What?

1203
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,334
Just please come with me.

1204
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,929
What? Oh, no, not back in there.

1205
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,145
So?

1206
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,816
So, what do you want?

1207
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,199
Honestly...

1208
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,033
I don't want to be a secret.

1209
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,712
Okay.

1210
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,416
Let's not be a secret.

1211
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,177
Excuse me.

1212
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,467
- Jesus, Rick!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1213
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,469
The head of security said he
wanted to talk to Mr. Weaver.

1214
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,472
He said it was urgent.

1215
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,723
- Ralph.
- Sonny.

1216
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,183
- Ali.
- Ralph.

1217
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,810
Everybody cozy?

1218
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,396
Good.

1219
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:54,572
Sonny, if you don't mind, I've got
something for you in my office.

1220
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,408
Got a new Callahan story for you.

1221
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,243
Not sure I want to hear it.

1222
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,912
You know, you hung me out to dry
pretty good with the last one.

1223
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,831
Just talked to Jack
Tate in Washington.

1224
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,250
He said when they found out
they had the number five pick,

1225
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,169
first thing they did was send
a copy of their playbook

1226
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,004
to all the guys they
were interested in.

1227
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,589
Right. We do the same thing.

1228
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,091
No, no, they put a little
special twist on it.

1229
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,594
They tape a $100 bill
to the last page.

1230
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:22,761
Why?

1231
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,430
So when they're
interviewin' the guys

1232
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,557
and they ask 'em if they'd
read the whole playbook,

1233
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,726
of course all of 'em
are gonna say yes.

1234
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:32,271
'Bout half of 'em, they mention the
money. But the other half don't.

1235
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,315
So, when they tell 'em
about the $100 bill,

1236
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:35,608
most of the guys get embarrassed.

1237
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,942
They get flustered.
They fess up that

1238
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,903
they didn't read the whole thing.

1239
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,447
But ask me what your
boy Bo Callahan did.

1240
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,449
You know, I really hate
playing this game with you.

1241
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,117
Ask.

1242
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,791
All right. What did Bo Callahan do?

1243
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:50,631
Neither.

1244
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,752
He said that he'd read it, and
then he didn't say anything.

1245
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,963
So?

1246
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:00,299
He didn't know about the
$100 bill, Sonny. He lied.

1247
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,842
He never read the whole playbook.

1248
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,135
So? A lot of guys don't.

1249
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,887
Yes. But when they
confront him about it

1250
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,473
and they tell him about
the money, he lied again.

1251
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:08,599
He said something like,

1252
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,819
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember.
Good one. Good one, guys."

1253
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,647
Jack said he is the only
guy to tell the lie

1254
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:19,153
and then to have the balls to
stand and stick up for the lie.

1255
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,696
Said it was the second
strangest response

1256
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,120
he had seen to the $100 bill thing.

1257
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,203
Wanna know what the first was?

1258
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:31,664
God damn it, Ralph. Just tell me.

1259
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,759
A kid mailed the $100
bill back to them.

1260
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,254
That kid put it in a card,
and he wrote on the card,

1261
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,340
"Save this for when I win
you the Super Bowl."

1262
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,967
Nice.

1263
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,426
Don't you wanna know
who that kid was?

1264
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,304
No!

1265
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,436
It was Brian Drew.

1266
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,192
It was Brian Drew.

1267
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,504
Hey, Zotti.

1268
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,298
Texans thinkin' of makin' a move?

1269
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,717
Talk to me about Vontae Mack.

1270
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,218
Why? What do you wanna know?

1271
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,720
Who cares why?

1272
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:29,888
But you...

1273
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,890
You're thinkin' of
pickin' him at 15?

1274
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,018
He's got potential, no?

1275
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,738
Friend-to-friend, what
else do I need to know?

1276
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,232
Well, he's a great kid.

1277
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,317
Come on!

1278
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,068
That's what I know!

1279
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,820
Quit playing games.

1280
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,740
You didn't think he was gonna fall
in the second round, did you?

1281
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:49,033
Somebody's gonna pick him, Sonny.

1282
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,911
Tell me why that shouldn't be me.

1283
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,834
I'd never tell you
how to do your job.

1284
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,873
You find something with him?

1285
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,422
I didn't say that.

1286
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,299
You didn't not say that.

1287
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,014
Good luck tonight.

1288
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,020
Stop runnin'!

1289
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,935
Any news?

1290
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,897
We just got off the phone
with Houston. They're at 15.

1291
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:22,617
With the Cleveland thing,
that might be your best shot.

1292
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:24,526
Fifteen?

1293
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,446
And I'm not 100% sure about that.

1294
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,365
What does that mean, man?

1295
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,617
It means it could be a long night.

1296
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,962
But stay positive. You never
know with these things.

1297
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,044
What's all this?

1298
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,172
Both of you? Really?

1299
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,301
Did you have a fire? Or...

1300
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,389
I do not need this today.
I really don't.

1301
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,931
You look terrible.

1302
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:54,973
Thank you.

1303
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,475
You really do.

1304
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,319
Thank you, too.

1305
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:02,281
We had the reading
of your dad's will.

1306
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:07,905
Would you believe, he wants his
ashes scattered on his field.

1307
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:10,164
The practice field? Here?

1308
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,325
Weaver Field. Yes.

1309
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,286
And I'd like to do it
as soon as possible.

1310
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,122
You can't be serious.

1311
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:19,623
Why? I'm not gonna bother anyone.

1312
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,501
I just wanna do it exactly
as he asked for it.

1313
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:27,178
And he wants you to read
this while we're scattering.

1314
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,341
It's a Gaelic blessing.

1315
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,640
Now? You're saying you
want to do all this now?

1316
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:35,347
All we have to do is walk out
on the 50-yard line with you...

1317
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,765
- You read the...
- With me?

1318
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,183
It's what he wanted.

1319
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,185
How the hell would you
know what he wanted?

1320
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,353
Please don't shout.

1321
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,856
Because I was at the will
reading. Unlike you.

1322
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,524
Isn't there an art
exhibition in New York

1323
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:47,276
that you have to be
at or something?

1324
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,194
This isn't going to
be a long affair.

1325
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,613
We just go out there, read the
prayer, dump the ashes, and go home.

1326
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,698
No!

1327
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,325
Is everything okay?

1328
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,212
Everything's fine.

1329
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,965
Ali, this is my ex-wife, Angie.

1330
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,052
- Hello.
- Hi.

1331
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,545
Hi, Barb.

1332
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,172
How you doin', Amy?

1333
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:12,556
"Ali." You know it's Ali.

1334
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:15,058
She's the...

1335
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,389
Oh, her. Oh.

1336
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,724
Yeah. That's me.

1337
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,559
Get us some coffee,
will you, sweetie?

1338
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,227
Mom, that's not her job.

1339
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,146
- It's okay. I can get 'em coffee.
- I'll have a green tea.

1340
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,689
No, stay. Just, please, stay.

1341
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,899
I'd like to have a coffee, Sonny.

1342
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,067
No. No. No coffee, Mom.

1343
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,403
You want to spread these goddamn
ashes, you do it tomorrow!

1344
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,905
- No.
- I'm serious!

1345
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,578
No!

1346
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,580
Now then, are you going to read this
prayer as your father asked you to?

1347
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,879
No, I'm not!

1348
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,379
Not today.

1349
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,931
Fine.

1350
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,760
I will do it myself.

1351
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,765
Good luck.

1352
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,562
How about some fresh air?

1353
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,445
Whoever thought it meant
that much to him?

1354
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:17,701
Naming a simple practice
field in his honor.

1355
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:22,129
God, he took pride in
the weirdest things.

1356
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,962
He was your father, Sonny.

1357
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,972
What was it? Why did
you hate him so much?

1358
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,559
I didn't hate my father.

1359
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:41,974
You know what, everyone always gives
me grief for firing my father.

1360
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,775
Well, you did. I was here that day.

1361
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,657
It was my mother.

1362
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,650
What?

1363
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,318
It was my mother.

1364
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,487
Look, don't get me wrong.
I'm the one who fired him.

1365
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:59,242
But it was my mother
who asked me to do it.

1366
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,290
My dad's doctors told
him that the stress

1367
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,750
of coaching was gonna
kill him, so...

1368
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,169
Of course, he refused to retire.

1369
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,630
So, now I have a choice.

1370
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,759
The time he has left at
home with my mother,

1371
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,679
or another year on the sidelines,

1372
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:25,777
where maybe he drops dead
on national television.

1373
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,356
So what do you do?

1374
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,530
I gave it to my mom
and I fired him.

1375
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:37,363
How come you never
told me that before?

1376
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,032
You know, there's already so
many versions of what happened

1377
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,867
that it's not really somethin'
I love talking about.

1378
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,493
You never told him?

1379
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:46,204
You let him believe that his
only son would just fire him?

1380
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,539
That's how we do
things in my family.

1381
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,212
Sonny.

1382
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:55,219
And all I ever wanted to do
was just get him a ring.

1383
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,227
Oh, jeez...

1384
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,141
What is this?

1385
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,479
They wanna pay their respects.

1386
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,083
Rick, what are you doing?

1387
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,923
Someone broke my computer.

1388
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,762
Can you believe that? I mean, this
thing had my entire life on it, and...

1389
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,936
I don't know. Who would do that?

1390
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,604
It was me.

1391
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,520
I threw it against the wall.

1392
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:50,436
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1393
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,938
Why would you do that?

1394
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,942
Look, I lost my head, okay?

1395
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,401
I've been steppin'
on my dick all day.

1396
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,951
Look, we'll get you a new one,
all right? We'll get you a better one.

1397
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,622
One with all the
bells and whistles.

1398
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,920
Look. You've been a soldier today,
all right? You don't deserve this.

1399
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,625
Okay?

1400
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,627
- Yeah.
- Good.

1401
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:38,150
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome to the red carpet,

1402
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:43,655
from the University of Wisconsin,
2014 Heisman Trophy winner,

1403
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,657
quarterback Bo Callahan!

1404
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,622
From Florida State University,

1405
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:55,459
running back Ray Jennings.

1406
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,505
How're you doin'?

1407
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,643
Ray, remind me when they
picked you. Was it first? Second?

1408
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:14,853
Mmm.

1409
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,903
It still hurts. 26th.

1410
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,946
Well, that's good, too.

1411
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,528
That's my number one
guy right there.

1412
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:24,863
Ready?

1413
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,457
You got this.

1414
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,132
Sonny, my man!

1415
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,428
Oh, I am excited to
hear your voice.

1416
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,137
We were wonderin' when you were
gonna call us with that good news.

1417
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,639
Wanna talk to Bo, Chris.

1418
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,733
Here's the man you wanna speak to.

1419
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,148
It's the Browns.

1420
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:00,650
This is Bo.

1421
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,193
Hey, Bo. How you doin'?

1422
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,737
Well, I'm good, Mr. Weaver. Excited
to be a part of the NFL, you know.

1423
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,912
Good, that's great, Bo.
Thrilled to hear that.

1424
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,660
Listen, I'm gonna ask you something

1425
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,412
and I want you to be
absolutely honest with me.

1426
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,956
You think you can do that?

1427
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:17,754
Yes, sure. Anything, Mr. Weaver.

1428
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:23,048
Bo, did your teammates come
to your birthday party?

1429
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:24,928
What?

1430
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:29,845
For your 21st birthday party,

1431
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:35,773
I'm asking, did your teammates at
Wisconsin come to that party or not?

1432
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,938
Look, Mr. Weaver,
this isn't somethin'

1433
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:43,113
I'm really very proud
of, sir, but...

1434
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,697
I don't really remember a single
thing from that night, sir.

1435
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,956
You know what?

1436
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,212
I don't remember mine either.

1437
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,465
Thanks, Bo. Talk to you later.

1438
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,470
What'd he say?

1439
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,554
Nothin'.

1440
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:47,965
Hey.

1441
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,141
You okay?

1442
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:59,143
Do I take Callahan?

1443
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,318
What do you want me to say?

1444
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:06,525
He's a winner.

1445
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,328
He is.

1446
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:13,281
He is. I mean, that's the word, right?
He's won everywhere he's been.

1447
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,908
I get that.

1448
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,828
But they said the same
thing about Ryan Leaf

1449
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:21,206
when he was the number
two pick in '98.

1450
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,881
No one said that about Tom
Brady when he went 199th.

1451
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,048
There's no such thing
as a sure thing.

1452
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:36,601
At the end of the day, all that
matters is what you think.

1453
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,614
Vontae! Vontae!

1454
01:14:57,368 --> 01:15:00,996
Here we go, Brownies,
here we go! Whoo, whoo!

1455
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:04,717
Here we go, Brownies,
here we go! Whoo, whoo!

1456
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:27,105
Oh, dude, that's,
like, your fifth piece of pizza.

1457
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,691
I eat when I'm nervous. Don't
make me feel bad about it.

1458
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:31,609
Yeah, I get like that, too.

1459
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,238
Hey, guys. It's gettin' late.

1460
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,493
History in the making here
today at the NFL Draft.

1461
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,996
Already fascinating
twists and turns

1462
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,540
as the Seattle Seahawks
and the Cleveland Browns

1463
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:50,763
have engaged in a historic trade
just hours before this moment.

1464
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,474
Here's the Commissioner.

1465
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:19,451
Welcome to primetime and
the 2014 NFL Draft.

1466
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:23,079
This is an exciting
night for our players,

1467
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,837
our teams,

1468
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,873
and for you, the fans.

1469
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:34,674
The season begins tonight,
so let's kick it off.

1470
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:39,763
The 2014 NFL Draft
is officially open.

1471
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:47,311
After an earlier trade with
the Seattle Seahawks today,

1472
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,272
the Cleveland Browns
are now on the clock.

1473
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,527
Where the hell is Sonny, guys?
We're on the clock here.

1474
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,862
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Should be here.

1475
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,614
Okay. So the
Browns now have 10 minutes

1476
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,407
on the clock to make a choice.

1477
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,576
And if they don't do
that in that time,

1478
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:06,121
the team picking behind
them can then jump up

1479
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:09,249
and potentially steal away the
player the Browns wanted.

1480
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:13,044
It's a situation we saw play out in
2003 with the Minnesota Vikings

1481
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:17,095
and it happened again in 2011
with the Baltimore Ravens.

1482
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,100
Sonny!

1483
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:30,855
Yeah, thank God! Yeah, I was
wondering what you were doing.

1484
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,731
Yeah. It's go time, boss.

1485
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:37,452
Yeah, yeah. What name do you
want the Commissioner to say?

1486
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,323
All right.

1487
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,626
Hey, guys, he's here.

1488
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,920
Sonny, thank God. Where you
been? We're on the clock!

1489
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,755
Sonny, when are we
sendin' in the ticket?

1490
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,257
Yeah.

1491
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,301
I already sent the ticket.

1492
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,760
You did what?

1493
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,596
You sent the ticket?

1494
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:05,930
It's tradition! We all send it!

1495
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,682
New tradition, guys, all right?

1496
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:11,778
When this team starts winning,
we'll go back to that.

1497
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:21,863
And the pick is finally in.

1498
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,031
It's currently being brandished

1499
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,200
by some walkie-talkied individual

1500
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,294
taking it up to the
Commissioner's podium.

1501
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,336
A big, humongous pick for
the Cleveland Browns.

1502
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,876
Now, to find out whose
name is on that card,

1503
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,796
here's the Commissioner ready
to make history in Cleveland.

1504
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,940
With the first pick of
the 2014 NFL Draft,

1505
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:56,314
the Cleveland Browns select.

1506
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,945
Vontae Mack, linebacker,
Ohio State.

1507
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,499
Yes! Yes!

1508
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,798
These things happen.

1509
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,513
That's what you decided to do?

1510
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,105
An absolute stunner here
at Radio City Music Hall.

1511
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,315
The Cleveland Browns, with
the number one overall pick,

1512
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,609
take Vontae Mack!

1513
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,695
Unbelievable to me
that Sonny Weaver Jr.

1514
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,822
Would make a deal of this magnitude

1515
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,365
and come away with this.

1516
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,033
Forget about Vontae
Mack for a second.

1517
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,702
They could have had Bo Callahan.

1518
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:53,204
He's the surefire slam-dunk
number one pick.

1519
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,789
We all knew it comin' in here.

1520
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,709
If I'm Brian Drew, current
quarterback of the Cleveland Browns,

1521
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,085
I better play good.

1522
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,452
Yeah. No, no. I realize that.

1523
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:34,329
He wants to talk to him right now.

1524
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,580
Then call me back.

1525
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:36,622
I'm sorry, sir...

1526
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,041
Just get in the damn car.

1527
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,542
This is Anthony.

1528
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:41,377
Tell Sonny I'm on
my way to Teterboro

1529
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:45,974
and I will literally be in his face in
an hour and he will talk to me then.

1530
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,968
I will, sir.

1531
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,762
- Safe trip, sir.
- Thank you, Marvin.

1532
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,823
It's Sonny.

1533
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,784
Sonny Weaver Jr.

1534
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:16,164
Congratulations, Vontae.
You're a Cleveland Brown.

1535
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:19,541
I'm a Cleveland Brown!

1536
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,626
Car's gonna be picking
you up in 10 minutes,

1537
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,294
and we're flying you to Cleveland.

1538
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,012
You think you can manage that?

1539
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:28,474
Oh...

1540
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,103
You need to get back inside.

1541
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,267
What just happened?

1542
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:40,736
This is the NFL Draft.

1543
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,990
These things happen all the time.

1544
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:46,109
Now trust me.

1545
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:49,153
These teams, they don't want
a quarterback that panics.

1546
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:52,032
I need you to come inside, now.

1547
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,293
Come on.

1548
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:12,685
You picked Vontae. Wow.

1549
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:17,975
Three first-round picks to get the
guy I could have gotten all along.

1550
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:21,978
Jesus, I used to think
I was good at this.

1551
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,729
Well, that remains to be seen.

1552
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:28,611
Sometimes, the correct
path is the tortured one.

1553
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:31,946
It's a gift, Sonny.

1554
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:35,576
You see things other people
don't see. It's one of the things...

1555
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:41,415
It's one of the things
I love about you.

1556
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,463
Excuse me.

1557
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:50,923
You're not gonna believe
what's happening.

1558
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:52,425
You know, I think back, Deion,

1559
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:56,554
and I go back to 1983 and I start
thinkin' about Dan Marino.

1560
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,222
He was the sixth
quarterback taken...

1561
01:22:58,223 --> 01:22:59,765
Holy shit!

1562
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:00,850
What's goin' on?

1563
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,773
He's dropping.

1564
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:03,978
What?

1565
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,189
Picks number two and three
are not Bo Callahan.

1566
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,987
Nobody's pickin' him.

1567
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,861
Just last year.

1568
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,404
Geno Smith drops
out of the first round,

1569
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:16,491
and there are all kinds of
rumors goin' on right now,

1570
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:19,165
"Why is this kid dropping and..."

1571
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:21,746
Everybody's freaking out, Sonny.

1572
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,841
St. Louis went with Anderson.
Miami took Palmer.

1573
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,877
Who's picking fourth?

1574
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,425
Arizona.

1575
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,464
Are they gonna take Callahan?

1576
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:33,841
They should, but
everybody's off their game.

1577
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,427
Rams and the Dolphins, both
went with their expected picks,

1578
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,179
even though Bo was still available.

1579
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,723
Everybody's panickin' 'cause
Callahan's still there.

1580
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:44,524
Jesus, what if he drops to seventh?
Seahawks have seventh.

1581
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,562
What if they ended
up with Callahan?

1582
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:49,232
Well, then Tom Michaels
is the GM of the decade.

1583
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:52,443
I'm goin' to the can, to throw up.

1584
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:56,197
Okay. Denver has five.
Jacksonville has six.

1585
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,782
Yeah, but Denver's not
gonna take Callahan.

1586
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,283
They got Herrod, he's an All-Pro.

1587
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,458
So if Arizona balks, then
Jacksonville's all over him.

1588
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,789
Unless they balk, too.

1589
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,251
And our friend Tom Michaels
grabs him at seven. Shit!

1590
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:11,221
They have that kid GM down in
Jacksonville. What is his name?

1591
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,297
Jeff Carson.

1592
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,465
Rookie.

1593
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,764
Right, Jeff Carson.

1594
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:42,535
Hey, buddy.

1595
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:44,954
Holy shit, man. What do you
know? What do you know?

1596
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,547
About what?

1597
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,500
About this! About this thing!
What's wrong with Callahan?

1598
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,669
Nothing. We like Vontae better.

1599
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,171
The Rams took my pick.
Everything's out of whack.

1600
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,720
Well, you still have time.

1601
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,969
Arizona is picking right now.

1602
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,847
You're right. Hold on.

1603
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:06,976
With the fourth pick
of the 2014 NFL Draft,

1604
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:09,395
the Arizona Cardinals select

1605
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:13,357
Robert Starks, cornerback,
Georgia Tech.

1606
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,497
Wow. Arizona went corner.

1607
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,699
Shit. Starks was my backup.

1608
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,577
That's a tough break, but,
hey, Callahan's still in play.

1609
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:26,245
Who's pickin' fifth?

1610
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:28,956
The Broncos, and they're
not taking Callahan.

1611
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,250
They got Matt Herrod.
They don't need Callahan.

1612
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:32,376
Yeah, I think you're right.

1613
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,378
I think they're gonna go with
that big kid outta Oregon.

1614
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,802
Dearborne. Left tackle.

1615
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,343
Well, congratulations, Jeff.

1616
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,386
Looks like you got
yourself Bo Callahan

1617
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,555
to quarterback the
Jacksonville Jaguars.

1618
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,729
You gotta be straight with me.

1619
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,643
About what?

1620
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:51,479
What's wrong with Callahan?
Why is everyone passin' on him?

1621
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,772
Why did you pass on him?

1622
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:54,523
I told you. We like Vontae better.

1623
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:58,778
Damn it, Sonny, I'm about to
be on the clock here. Please.

1624
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:00,321
What's wrong with Callahan?

1625
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:01,739
Can I be frank with you?

1626
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,241
Yes.

1627
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:05,868
I think he's a bust.

1628
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,412
What?

1629
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:09,705
How? Why?

1630
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:12,425
I don't know. Gut feeling.

1631
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:16,045
To be honest, Jeff, it's a
character thing for me.

1632
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:17,380
But, look, I have other needs.

1633
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,757
So, if you wanna make
a trade for six,

1634
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:21,926
I can make that happen right now.

1635
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:24,220
You want six? Who are you takin'?

1636
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,848
I can't tell you that, Jeff.

1637
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,934
The question is, do you
want to make a trade?

1638
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,770
Because if you're not
sold on Callahan,

1639
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:35,064
you can still come out of here
with a handful of draft picks,

1640
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:37,108
you look like a seasoned pro,

1641
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:40,027
and everybody wonders what
you're up to next year.

1642
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,029
I don't know. I don't know, Sonny.

1643
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:47,081
Look, Jeff, every year someone comes
out of this looking like a donkey.

1644
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,537
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1645
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,122
Good. Because tomorrow
I got a feeling

1646
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,625
it could be you if you
don't make this deal.

1647
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,505
Look, everyone else has a reason

1648
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,350
to pass on Bo Callahan. You don't.

1649
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:05,144
Give me six.

1650
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,181
Give me six and I'll give you
our second-round pick this year

1651
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,267
and our second-rounder next year.

1652
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:12,940
Do what?

1653
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,022
Oh! That sounds awesome,
Sonny. What am I, a jerk?

1654
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,400
I'm just spit-balling here, Jeff.

1655
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:22,987
Two number twos for the
sixth overall? I'm not an idiot.

1656
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:25,239
I'd give you ones, but
I already dealt 'em.

1657
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,700
Well, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

1658
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,243
Jesus, the clock.

1659
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,745
I know. Denver hasn't picked yet,

1660
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:33,123
but they will any
second, all right?

1661
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:36,589
Shit, Sonny, I need more. Tell me.

1662
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,179
What is the very best
that you can do?

1663
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:53,063
Final offer.

1664
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,936
Take our number two pick this year,

1665
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,731
next year, and the
next year after that.

1666
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:01,326
That's three years of number two picks.

1667
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:12,667
Four. I want your next
four number twos.

1668
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:16,707
Nah, Jeff, I'm not gonna do that.

1669
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,293
Stay with me on planet
Earth here, all right?

1670
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,013
You know what I just
offered you is fair.

1671
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,269
So, three years of second-rounders?

1672
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:30,179
That's right. For
your pick right now.

1673
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,847
And you and your guys can regroup,

1674
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:35,397
figure yourselves out and relax.

1675
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,033
This is a good deal, Jeff.

1676
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:47,243
This is a good deal for both of us.

1677
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,204
Deal.

1678
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,919
Good, Jeff. You did good.

1679
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,764
Call it in. Call it in.

1680
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,100
Hey, this is Marx.

1681
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:12,806
We got something, Ken.

1682
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:15,975
- Cleveland's in this.
- And Jacksonville.

1683
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:17,477
Okay, give it to me.

1684
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,938
Okay, somebody get me Tom
Michaels on the phone.

1685
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,986
Tell me you didn't
just do that, Sonny.

1686
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,443
Michaels. Tom Michaels.

1687
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:27,528
Are we on the clock?

1688
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:29,446
Tell me you didn't just do that.

1689
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:30,531
We just got the number six pick.

1690
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:33,158
And, no, we are not on the clock.
Denver's on the clock.

1691
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:35,452
Okay, so we got six!
Who are we picking at six?

1692
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,121
Rick, can you get Marvin
on the phone now?

1693
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,289
Let me get this straight.

1694
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:41,292
In the span of one day, you
have managed to burn through

1695
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:44,503
three years' worth of number one and
number two picks, is that correct?

1696
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:45,588
Yeah.

1697
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:47,506
- I quit, Sonny.
- Don't quit.

1698
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,258
I can't coach a team that
doesn't have a future, Sonny.

1699
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:50,384
That's the way it works.

1700
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,677
I got Tom Michaels on the line!

1701
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:53,178
Sonny, are we trading six?

1702
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:55,602
Will everyone please just shut up?

1703
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,641
People, please,

1704
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:01,897
can I have a moment of goddamn silence
while I do my job here, okay?

1705
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,858
Look. Don't quit, all right?

1706
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:09,236
Just let me do my job here.
Just let me do this. Don't quit now.

1707
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:12,741
If, by the end of the night, you
still wanna quit, then quit.

1708
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:15,034
Just see what I do from here.

1709
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,785
Your show, Sonny.

1710
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,378
Tom Michaels is holding.

1711
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,790
You son of a bitch!

1712
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,542
Anthony, I need five
minutes, all right?

1713
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:25,461
Five minutes, and
then you can fire me.

1714
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:26,962
Sonny, you are a dead man.

1715
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,465
Mr. Molina. Mr. Molina.
Look at me. Look at me.

1716
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:31,926
Just give him a minute.
He knows what he's doing.

1717
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,260
Tom, it's Sonny.

1718
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,347
Jesus, Mary and Whatnot. Do I
owe you a thank you, Weaver?

1719
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:38,265
Jacksonville's on the clock

1720
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,352
and I'm one more crazy
shit-show from insanity.

1721
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:45,147
Can you imagine, scoring three
first-round picks and Bo Callahan?

1722
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:48,817
Lord God, let that infant
John Carson screw this up.

1723
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:51,111
It's Jeff Carson, Tom, and
he doesn't have the pick.

1724
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,704
I do.

1725
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,407
What?

1726
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:59,703
I just made a trade with Jacksonville.
I'm on the clock. It's me.

1727
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:00,788
Bullshit!

1728
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:01,997
The Jacksonville Jaguars

1729
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,248
have made a trade.

1730
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:07,674
The Cleveland Browns now have the
sixth pick and are on the clock.

1731
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,758
Sonny, what'd you give 'em?

1732
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:14,343
No time for that. I'm on the clock.

1733
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,470
I'm gonna pick Bo, Tom.
Unless you want him more.

1734
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,430
And if so, let's make a deal.

1735
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,308
We still have Bo Callahan?

1736
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:22,777
What the hell's goin' on, Sonny?

1737
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:24,853
Everyone thinks
there's something wrong

1738
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,355
with the kid, but you
don't, all right?

1739
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:27,481
You've done your due diligence.

1740
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,483
You're about to pull off
the move of the century.

1741
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:32,453
But you need my pick to do it.
So make me an offer.

1742
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,740
You've gone rogue.
You've gone renegade.

1743
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,539
Yeah, that's right.
That's exactly right.

1744
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:41,829
I could have gotten
Vontae at seven,

1745
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,288
but instead I trade up with you

1746
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:44,707
just so I could get him at one.

1747
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,959
Jesus Christ. You were
right about me, Tom.

1748
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,878
I am a crazy man. So, come
on, take advantage of it.

1749
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:51,596
What are you waitin' for?

1750
01:31:55,093 --> 01:31:59,018
Make me a deal, Tom, at six,
and you get your boy wonder.

1751
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:02,563
What do you want?

1752
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,771
I want my number ones
back. All of 'em.

1753
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,900
That's crazy. Why would
I give them back?

1754
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:14,778
Because, at the end of the
day, no one's the wiser, Tom.

1755
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,030
You haven't lost anything

1756
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:17,156
and you get the quarterback messiah

1757
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:20,706
you've always wanted
for $7 million less.

1758
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:29,251
Nah. No, I can't do it. I'd look
like an idiot, like I panicked.

1759
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:30,878
You take him. You
obviously don't want to.

1760
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:32,546
I'll stick with my draft picks.

1761
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,965
Yeah, but you want
him, Tom, don't you?

1762
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:37,426
Seahawks fans want a
hero and you denied 'em.

1763
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:39,178
- Not that bad.
- Don't lie to me.

1764
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:41,388
I checked all the Seahawk
fan blogs and chat rooms.

1765
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,599
They're all calling for your head.

1766
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,142
Ever since you traded
away Callahan,

1767
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:46,852
the barbarians are at the gate.

1768
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:48,562
I don't care about that.

1769
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,942
Yeah, you do.
You and I both know it.

1770
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,693
I have the golden ticket now, Tom,

1771
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:59,290
and if I give it to you, you get to
save Seahawk football in Seattle.

1772
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:02,785
Um...

1773
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:06,163
How 'bout I give you
number two picks?

1774
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:07,748
No. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

1775
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:10,334
No, I want my picks
back. All of them.

1776
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:13,295
I want all three years of
this team's future back.

1777
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:14,338
That's not fair!

1778
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:15,798
Well, you wanna cry about it, Tom,

1779
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:17,007
or you wanna make a little magic

1780
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:19,351
before the clock runs
out on both of us?

1781
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:23,263
$7 million cheaper solves
our salary cap problem.

1782
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,099
We're still gonna give
the fans what they want.

1783
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,350
Okay. Screw it!

1784
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:28,227
No more offer. It's
off the table, Tom.

1785
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:30,187
- I'm takin' Callahan.
- Whoa, whoa. No, no.

1786
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:31,563
Wait, wait!

1787
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,401
All right. You have a deal.

1788
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:39,200
I'll give you your picks!
We have a deal!

1789
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:41,991
What else do we need?

1790
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:44,993
Offense?

1791
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:46,370
Special teams. Putney! Get Putney!

1792
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:47,955
Yes! David Putney! Putney!

1793
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:49,833
Yeah. Putney.

1794
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:54,011
Hello? Sonny?

1795
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,340
I'm sorry, that deal's
now off the table.

1796
01:33:58,341 --> 01:33:59,633
What?

1797
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:03,434
We live in a different world than
we did just 30 seconds ago.

1798
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:05,389
Come on.

1799
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,891
What?

1800
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:09,189
What do you want now?

1801
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:13,814
I want my picks back

1802
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,400
and I want David Putney.

1803
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,985
I need a punt returner.

1804
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,156
Where the hell did that come from?

1805
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:24,158
It doesn't matter.
I want all my picks back.

1806
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,660
And I want David goddamn Putney
just because I feel like it.

1807
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,120
- You're outta your mind.
- Yeah, I am.

1808
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:30,498
Haven't I proved that already?

1809
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:34,001
You make this deal right now,
Tom, and you get Bo Callahan.

1810
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:35,503
Say it with me.

1811
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:39,382
"You get Bo."

1812
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,783
Come on, Tom, say it with me,
you pancake-eating motherfucker.

1813
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,774
All right. Shit. Deal.

1814
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:59,484
Great! You're welcome.

1815
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,487
Confirm the trade.

1816
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:06,038
God damn it, I love this job!

1817
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:12,832
Hold on. Looks like Cleveland's
making another trade.

1818
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:14,291
We got a trade.

1819
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,959
Okay, this means we're
picking next, all right?

1820
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,087
Back at seven, where we started.

1821
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,881
Tom's gonna take Bo.
So who do we got?

1822
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:22,474
Ray Jennings.

1823
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,888
We take Ray Jennings.

1824
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,182
That's right. Cleveland royalty.

1825
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:31,934
Haven't I been telling
everybody that

1826
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:34,153
that's what we need,
a running back?

1827
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,355
Still wanna quit, Coach?

1828
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:37,857
What?

1829
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:40,442
Does this sound like a
team that you wanna coach?

1830
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:42,236
Because the Browns
are ready to roll.

1831
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,489
We just need the right
man at the wheel.

1832
01:35:45,782 --> 01:35:47,658
I can coach this team.

1833
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:49,451
I know you can.

1834
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:51,828
Why don't you give
Ray Jennings a call?

1835
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:53,914
Ask him if he wants to be a Brown.

1836
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:56,964
Then tell him to pack his bags
so he can join us at our party.

1837
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:59,761
My pleasure, boss.

1838
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:09,230
You got some set of balls,
Sonny. Congratulations.

1839
01:36:12,225 --> 01:36:13,726
Thank you.

1840
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:27,030
After a trade with the
Cleveland Browns,

1841
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:32,037
with the sixth pick of
the 2014 NFL Draft,

1842
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:36,250
the Seattle Seahawks
select Bo Callahan.

1843
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:39,886
Quarterback, University
of Wisconsin.

1844
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,284
Hello?

1845
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:18,340
Hold on.

1846
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:22,544
Hello?

1847
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:25,172
Ray? Coach Penn of the
Cleveland Browns.

1848
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:26,590
Hi, Coach.

1849
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:30,766
How would you like to play
for your Pop's old team?

1850
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:44,775
I'm gonna be a Brown.

1851
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,905
You're gonna be a Brown!

1852
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,865
General Manager Sonny Weaver Jr.

1853
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:53,742
Took one pick in the first round,

1854
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,285
the number seven pick.

1855
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,789
He sprinkled it with fairy
dust, wished upon a star,

1856
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,541
and somehow, he turned it
into not one, not two,

1857
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:04,461
but three potentially
impactful players

1858
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:06,630
for his team next year. One pick!

1859
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:10,476
He took a chance and went with
his gut and took his guys.

1860
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:12,260
Make no mistake about it.

1861
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:14,805
The Cleveland Browns are
his team now for sure.

1862
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:17,724
This is the Draft
Day Browns fans were waiting for.

1863
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,935
Sonny Weaver Jr. pulled it off.

1864
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:21,853
When you were like,
"I want all my picks back,

1865
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,606
"and I want David goddamn
Putney because I feel like it!"

1866
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:27,442
Like, how did you
come up with that?

1867
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:28,568
I was pissed.

1868
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:29,986
Here, look
at who we have right now.

1869
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,279
Let me break it down.

1870
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:36,660
Vontae Mack, the guy who plays
with more passion and inspiration

1871
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:40,165
than anyone in college
football, he's a Brown.

1872
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:44,376
Ray Jennings, the running back the
Browns have needed for years.

1873
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:46,711
A return man to help
out on special teams,

1874
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:49,381
and, Rich, just like we wanted,

1875
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:53,802
Brian Drew, back at
quarterback, where he belongs.

1876
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:55,595
I don't even wanna hear
about Bo Callahan.

1877
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:59,015
If he thinks Callahan's a bust,
who am I to argue with that?

1878
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:02,352
He turned nothin' into
a big-time somethin'.

1879
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,854
Smile for the cameras, Coach.

1880
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:06,606
This is a day for
Cleveland to celebrate.

1881
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,733
We had a great day!

1882
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:13,697
Super Bowl! Super Bowl! Super Bowl!

1883
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:24,708
That was gonna go
down a different way.

1884
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:26,210
Mom?

1885
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,172
There you are.

1886
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:31,673
You okay?

1887
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:33,884
Yeah. It was just so
noisy downstairs,

1888
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:36,433
I had to get a few
minutes of quiet.

1889
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,977
We're taking off.

1890
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,517
You sure you're gonna be okay?

1891
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:47,063
I think your dad would have been

1892
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:49,783
very happy to coach
a team like this.

1893
01:39:57,158 --> 01:39:59,331
I think so, too.

1894
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:01,078
Thank you.

1895
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:08,168
Look, we gotta go.

1896
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:11,548
Of course. It was a long day.

1897
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:15,726
Bye, Ali.

1898
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,513
Good night, Barb.

1899
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,435
Hey, Mom.

1900
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,988
We're gonna have a baby.

1901
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:41,752
You're gonna be a grandma.

1902
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:47,378
Thank you.

1903
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,428
Wow!

1904
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,308
That was big.

1905
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,725
I'll get my stuff.

1906
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:46,099
Joe.

1907
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,602
Hey, Anthony, you did a hell
of a job with the Draft.

1908
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,186
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Jim.

1909
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:51,354
Very impressive, Anthony.

1910
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:52,897
Thanks, Bernie.

1911
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:55,241
I can't take all the credit.

1912
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:56,818
But I will.
