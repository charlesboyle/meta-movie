1
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,560
Jimmy? Come on.
You're serving today.

2
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,730
Christine?
Where's my pants?

3
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:10,300
On the bed.
If they had teeth they would've bit you.

4
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,695
Jimmy! Go to the store,
buy me the newspaper and cigarettes.

5
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:37,005
Can't. Serving mass.
I'm an altar boy.

6
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:52,905
- Hey, Kevin!
- Hey, Jimmy!

7
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,770
- There you are.
- Overslept.

8
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,975
Well, you made it. I'll do the cruets
if you light the charcoal.

9
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,480
You think I'm fat?

10
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,715
You're all right. What?
Clothes don't fit?

11
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,315
No, they fit.

12
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,733
You're gonna be going to the bakery
after mass.

13
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,901
I am? Why don't you go?

14
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,104
I'm gonna be making breakfast.

15
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,271
I can make breakfast.

16
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,042
When have you ever?

17
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,810
Funny man.

18
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,118
Good morning, Connie.
- Good morning.

19
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,796
<i>Holy God, we praise thy name</i>

20
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,772
Good morning, Father.

21
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:37,879
<i>Lord of all, we bow before thee</i>

22
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:44,621
<i>All on Earth thy scepter claim</i>

23
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:51,286
<i>All in heaven above adore thee</i>

24
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,398
<i>Infinite thy vast domain</i>

25
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:03,537
<i>Everlasting is thy reign</i>

26
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:09,880
<i>Infinite thy vast domain</i>

27
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:17,722
<i>Everlasting is thy reign</i>

28
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,426
<i>Be seated.</i>

29
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,871
<i>What do you do when
you're not sure?</i>

30
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,709
<i>That's the topic
of my sermon today.</i>

31
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,919
<i>Last year when
President Kennedy was assassinated,</i>

32
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:55,217
<i>who among us did not experience
the most profound disorientation?</i>

33
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,625
<i>Despair?</i>

34
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,422
<i>Which way? What now?</i>

35
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,305
<i>What do I say to my kids?
What do I tell myself?</i>

36
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,736
<i>It was a time of people
sitting together,</i>

37
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:16,110
<i>bound together by a common
feeling of hopelessness.</i>

38
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,946
<i>But think of that.</i>

39
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:26,589
<i>Your bond with your fellow being
was your despair.</i>

40
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,492
<i>It was a public experience.
It was awful,</i>

41
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,566
<i>but we were in it together.</i>

42
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:42,766
<i>How much worse is it then
for the lone man, the lone woman,</i>

43
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,444
<i>stricken by a private calamity?</i>

44
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:53,782
<i>"No one knows I'm sick. " "No one
knows I've lost my last real friend. "</i>

45
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,356
<i>"No one knows
I've done something wrong. "</i>

46
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,294
<i>Imagine the isolation.</i>

47
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,858
<i>Now you see the world
as through a window.</i>

48
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:10,162
<i>On one side of the glass,
happy untroubled people,</i>

49
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,863
<i>and on the other side, you.</i>

50
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,332
- God bless you, Sister.
- Thank you.

51
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,103
<i>I wanna tell you a story.</i>

52
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,846
<i>A cargo ship sank one night.
It caught fire and went down,</i>

53
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,580
<i>and only this one sailor survived.</i>

54
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,089
<i>He found a lifeboat,
rigged a sail,</i>

55
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,662
<i>and being of a nautical discipline</i>

56
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,631
<i>turned his eyes to the heavens
and read the stars.</i>

57
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,761
<i>He set a course for his home,
and, exhausted, fell asleep.</i>

58
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,664
Just keeps going on.

59
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,468
<i>Clouds rolled in,</i>

60
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:56,640
<i>and for the next 20 nights,
he could no longer see the stars.</i>

61
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,314
<i>He thought he was on course,
but there was no way to be certain.</i>

62
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,954
<i>And as the days rolled on,
and the sailor wasted away,</i>

63
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,293
<i>he began to have doubts.</i>

64
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:17,229
<i>- He just keeps on going.
- Had he set his course right?</i>

65
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,828
<i>Was he still going on
towards his home?</i>

66
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,845
<i>Or was he horribly lost
and doomed to a terrible death?</i>

67
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,406
<i>No way to know.</i>

68
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,683
<i>The message of the constellations,</i>

69
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,486
<i>had he imagined it because
of his desperate circumstance?</i>

70
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,528
<i>- Or had he seen truth once...
- Straighten up!</i>

71
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,726
<i>...and now had to hold on to it
without further reassurance?</i>

72
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,399
<i>There are those of
you in church today</i>

73
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,770
<i>who know exactly
the crisis of faith I describe,</i>

74
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,671
<i>and I wanna say to you,</i>

75
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:08,584
<i>doubt can be a bond as powerful
and sustaining as certainty.</i>

76
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:15,755
<i>When you are lost,
you are not alone.</i>

77
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:25,135
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

78
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,407
<i>Please rise.</i>

79
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:37,444
<i>Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow</i>

80
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:41,979
<i>Praise him all creatures here...</i>

81
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,132
- Hey, Father.
- Hey, champ.

82
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,669
That was some sermon.

83
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,605
Did it mean something to you?

84
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,345
I wanna do that. I wanna be a priest.

85
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,481
You'd be a good one, I'm sure. Here.

86
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,084
Take a look.

87
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,161
See?

88
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:37,166
- She's dancing. Kind of neat?
- Yeah.

89
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,868
Here. You try.

90
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,484
That's for you. Take it.

91
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,856
- Thank you, Father.
- Welcome.

92
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,440
Like Noah's Ark, girls. Two by two.

93
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,140
Maryanne said it.
- Let's do it together.

94
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,444
Okay.
- Yeah. It's true.

95
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,986
And did I tell you that Jessica's
having a sleepover on Saturday?

96
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,919
Morning, Sister James.

97
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,752
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Beautiful day.

98
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,292
Not too bad.
How're the criminals doing today?

99
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,090
- Not bad, Father.
- Good, Father.

100
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,961
- Morning, champ.
- Morning, Father Flynn.

101
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,897
You wash those hands today,
Mr. London?

102
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,731
I washed them, Father.

103
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,862
I don't know. They're a different color
than your neck.

104
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,508
Morning.
- Morning, Father Flynn.

105
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,576
- Sister, are we having the test today?
- Get in line.

106
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,238
Tomorrow, William.

107
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,578
- Is it long division?
- Among other things.

108
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,346
Sister.
- Good morning, Sister.

109
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,479
- How much of it will be long division?
- Boy!

110
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,324
William London. Come up here.

111
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:18,969
Come smartly, now.
Don't make me wait.

112
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,971
What did he do?
- He touched Sister James.

113
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,704
The dragon is hungry.

114
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,711
You don't touch a nun.

115
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,027
Take out your history books, please.
Turn to page 683.

116
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,394
- Yes, Ralph.
- I forgot my history book.

117
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,798
You can look on with Raymond.

118
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,696
Mr. London?

119
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,809
- Do you have your history book?
- No, Sister.

120
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,176
- Share with Mr. Malloy, please.
- Do I have to? His breath stinks!

121
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,252
I'm sure Mr. Malloy's
breath is just fine.

122
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,524
Be seated.

123
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:24,234
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the
32nd president of the United States.

124
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,170
That barrette out of your hair,
Miss Horan.

125
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,707
Yes, Sister.

126
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,544
Morning, Sister James.
Continue.

127
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,004
Franklin D. Roosevelt, together with

128
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,209
Abraham Lincoln
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy,

129
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,617
was perhaps our greatest president.
When he assumed office,

130
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,781
13 million people in this country
were unemployed.

131
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,358
They'd lost hope,

132
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,552
and President Roosevelt
said to these people,

133
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,894
"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself. "

134
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,467
What did he mean by that? James?

135
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,130
I think he was trying to say
there's nothing really wrong.

136
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,711
- You know? So don't get so emotional.
- Maybe.

137
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,804
Maybe he was saying that
the world is good

138
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,645
and we need only work together
to overcome our problems.

139
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,776
What's this, Mr. Conroy?

140
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,887
I don't know, Sister.

141
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,627
You don't know you have a wire
coming out of your ear?

142
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,822
- No.
- Huh?

143
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,796
Huh?

144
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,333
No, Sister. I didn't.

145
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,806
You come with me, boy.

146
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,909
Go.

147
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,987
Who knows what the New Deal was?

148
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,391
<i>The first noel</i>

149
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,867
<i>The angels did say</i>

150
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,602
<i>Was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay</i>

151
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,438
I love this song.

152
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:18,516
<i>In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep</i>

153
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:25,356
<i>On a cold winter's night
that was so deep</i>

154
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:44,562
This past Sunday, what do you think
that sermon was about? Sister James?

155
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,204
Huh?

156
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,600
What was
Father Flynn's sermon about?

157
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:56,707
Well, doubt.
He was talking about doubt.

158
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,244
- Why?
- Excuse me, Sister?

159
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,448
Well, sermons come from somewhere,
don't they?

160
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,821
Is Father Flynn in doubt?

161
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,088
Is he concerned
that someone else is in doubt?

162
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,655
I suppose you'd have to ask him.

163
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,892
No, that would not be appropriate.

164
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,468
He is my superior,

165
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,436
and if he were troubled
he should confess it to a fellow priest

166
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,234
or to the monsignor.

167
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,935
We do not share
intimate information with priests.

168
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,944
- No.
- That's true.

169
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,844
What are we saying?

170
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,276
I want you all to be alert.

171
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:42,293
I am concerned, perhaps needlessly,
about matters in St. Nicholas School.

172
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,432
Academically?

173
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,836
I was not inviting a guessing game,
Sister Raymond.

174
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,770
Missy! Get away from her,
and sit down.

175
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,973
- May I join you, Sister Aloysius?
- Yes.

176
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,987
- Chicken chow mein.
- Sister Veronica's favorite.

177
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,151
It's very good.

178
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,424
I like the noodles. I like the crunch.

179
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,000
- What happened to William London?
- I sent him home.

180
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,165
- Oh, dear. So he's still bleeding?
- Yes.

181
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,334
His nose just let loose

182
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,911
and started gushing
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

183
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,570
Was it spontaneous?

184
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,875
- What?
- His nosebleed.

185
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,884
- What else would it be?
- Self-induced.

186
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,012
Mmm-hmm.

187
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,215
You mean you think

188
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,623
he might have intentionally
given himself a nosebleed?

189
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,023
Exactly.

190
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,355
No.

191
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,293
You are a very innocent person,
Sister James.

192
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,239
William London is a fidgety boy.

193
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,639
If you do not keep right on him,
he will do anything to escape his chair.

194
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:16,043
He would set his foot on fire
for half a day out of school.

195
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,709
Here. Sister, allow me to help you.
Your sleeve.

196
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,679
Uh-oh.

197
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,121
- Let's see.
- Oh, thank you, Sister.

198
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:33,253
- Sister Veronica is going blind.
- Oh, how horrible.

199
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,663
If they find out in the rectory,
she'll be gone.

200
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,066
So if she looks unsteady,
take her hand.

201
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:46,668
Ordinarily I assign my most
experienced teachers to eighth grade,

202
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:51,140
but I am working within constraints.

203
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:57,186
- Are you in control of your class?
- I think so.

204
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,157
Usually more students
are sent down to me.

205
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,921
I try to take care of things myself.

206
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,021
That can be an error.

207
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,498
You are answerable to me,
I to the monsignor,

208
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,264
he to the bishop,
and so on up to the Holy Father.

209
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,932
There is a chain. Make use of it.

210
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,503
Candy?

211
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,507
Cough drops.

212
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,945
Candy by another name.

213
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,319
How is Donald Miller doing?

214
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,615
- Steady.
- Good.

215
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,892
That girl, Noreen Horan.

216
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,054
I've seated her
as far away from the boys as possible.

217
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,529
- Doesn't do much good.
- Mmm.

218
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,892
Just get her through intact.

219
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,809
What's this?

220
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:59,577
The wind is so peripatetic this year.

221
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:05,150
- Is that the word I want?
- Is something the matter?

222
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,914
What?

223
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,324
Is something the matter?
- No.

224
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:16,265
- Why? Is something the matter?
- I don't think so.

225
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,893
- Well, then, nothing's the matter then.
- Yes.

226
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,905
- What's this?
- A pen.

227
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,404
A ballpoint pen.

228
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,777
The students are not using them
for assignments, I hope.

229
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,939
No, of course not.

230
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,280
I am sorry I allowed even
cartridge pens into this school.

231
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,853
Always easy way out, these days.

232
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:42,284
Every easy choice today
will have its consequence tomorrow.

233
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,361
- Mark my words.
- Yes, Sister.

234
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,363
Ballpoints make them press down.

235
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,296
When they press down,
they write like monkeys.

236
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:52,233
- I don't allow them ballpoint pens.
- And yet here one is.

237
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:58,208
Penmanship is dying
all across this country.

238
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,409
I hope not.

239
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,415
You should frame something.

240
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,782
Put it up on the blackboard.
Put the pope up.

241
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,287
That's the wrong pope. He's deceased.

242
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:17,157
I don't care what pope it is.
Use the glass to see behind you.

243
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:21,391
Children should think you have eyes
in the back of your head.

244
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,434
Wouldn't that be a little frightening?

245
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,299
Only to the ones
who are up to no good.

246
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,246
Relax. Put it up there.

247
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,341
All right, now.

248
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,587
The thing about shooting
from the foul line is it's psychological.

249
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,453
All right, come up with a routine.

250
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,392
You shift your weight, move your hips...

251
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,892
Yeah, you think that's funny, Ralph?

252
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,625
You know what's funny is
you never getting a foul shot.

253
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:01,337
All right, concentrate on the routine,
and you'll forget to get tensed up.

254
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,772
All right, go ahead, Jimmy.

255
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:15,348
Good man. You listen. That's good.
All right, now sit down, everyone.

256
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,848
Good.

257
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:24,195
On another matter, I've noticed
several of you guys got dirty nails.

258
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,890
All right, I don't want to see that.

259
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,557
I'm not talking about
the length of your nails.

260
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,135
I'm talking about cleanliness.

261
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,205
See, look at my nails.

262
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,575
- All right, they're long.
- Whoa!

263
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:47,082
Yeah, I like them a little long,
but look at how clean they are.

264
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,658
That makes it okay.

265
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,765
The climpity-clomp.
Clomp-clomp-clomp.

266
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,100
Harder than a herd of elephants.

267
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,742
You are wicked!

268
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,781
No, I told her, "You're her mother.

269
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:21,044
"You raised her. You fed her.
You tell her she's fat. "

270
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,754
But wait, how fat is she?

271
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,517
- What, the mother or the daughter?
- The daughter.

272
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,887
I never met the daughter.

273
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,257
- What about the mother?
- Fat.

274
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,080
Father, we having practice
after school?

275
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,450
If you guys want it, we can have it.
Let me know.

276
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:36,522
The Fascist governments
of Germany and Italy

277
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,993
were already working together.

278
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,030
They formed the Pact of Steel.

279
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,501
The Pact of Steel was...

280
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,762
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,671
...a military alliance between
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.

282
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:55,371
Mr. London, get back in your seat
and stop bothering Miss Horan, please.

283
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,212
Now, who can tell me...

284
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,986
Yes?

285
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,016
Yes. Of course, Father.

286
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,892
Donald? You should go to the rectory.

287
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:25,407
Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

288
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:31,710
Go one, two, three, touch.
One, two, three, kick.

289
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,015
And back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front. Again.

290
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,214
<i>We began to dance</i>

291
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,919
<i>Swaying to and fro</i>

292
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,127
<i>And soon I knew
I'd never let him go</i>

293
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,967
- Raymond, what are you doing?
- The mashed potato.

294
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,196
You're supposed to be doing
the bossa nova.

295
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,431
- But I know the mashed potato.
- Oh...

296
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:03,143
All right, now follow.
Back, side, front, kick.

297
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:08,151
Back, side... One, two, three, kick.

298
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:13,088
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

299
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,760
Let me get in front of you
so that you can see what I'm doing.

300
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,696
And one, two, three, touch.

301
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,861
One, two, three, kick.

302
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,873
Back, side, front, kick.
Back, side, front...

303
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:36,505
Okay. This is really good.
Very good there.

304
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,411
<i>Now I'm glad to say</i>

305
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,416
<i>I'm his bride to be</i>

306
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:46,656
<i>And we're gonna raise a family</i>

307
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,950
Donald, are you feeling ill?
- No.

308
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,655
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

309
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:31,128
- Are you all right?
- I just want to go home.

310
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:56,254
- Good afternoon, Sister.
- Good afternoon, Sister James.

311
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,626
Sister, can I speak with you
about Donald Miller?

312
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,833
Is he being accepted?
- He has no friends.

313
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,701
That would be a lot
to expect after only two months.

314
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,038
- Has anyone hit him?
- No.

315
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,540
Someone will.

316
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:23,678
And when that happens,
send them right down to me.

317
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,551
I'm not so sure anyone will.

318
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,162
This parish serves Irish
and Italian families.

319
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,663
Someone will hit Donald Miller.

320
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,964
He has a protector.

321
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,728
Who?

322
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,344
Father Flynn.

323
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,011
What?

324
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,891
He's taken an interest.

325
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,736
I told you to come to me,
but I hoped you never would.

326
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,409
Maybe I shouldn't have.

327
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,386
So, it's happened.

328
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,756
What? Oh, no. I'm not telling you that.
I'm not even certain what you mean.

329
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,224
Oh, excuse me there, Sisters.

330
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,196
No bother. We're done here.
Come, Sister.

331
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,873
What have you seen?

332
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,504
It is unsettling
to look at people with suspicion.

333
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,207
I feel less close to God.

334
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,410
When you take a step
to address wrongdoing,

335
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:05,784
you are taking a step away from God,
but in his service.

336
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,388
What have you seen?

337
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,123
Good afternoon, Sisters.

338
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,959
Good afternoon, Mrs. Carson.
Why the cat?

339
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,693
'Cause there's a mouse.
Want some tea?

340
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,703
If you don't want to dance with her,
don't dance with her.

341
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,796
- Well, is it wrong?
- No.

342
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,500
But what if the girl turns you down?

343
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,740
All right, you have the right
to ask a girl to dance.

344
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,579
All right,
she has the right to turn you down.

345
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,122
The trick is, don't take it to heart.

346
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,588
What if they all turn you down?

347
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,050
Well, then you become a priest.

348
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,225
All right, next question.

349
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,475
What have you seen?

350
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,143
He called Donald Miller to the rectory.

351
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,949
- What for?
- A talk.

352
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,114
- Alone?
- Yes.

353
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:16,193
- When?
- A week ago during class.

354
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,919
Why didn't you tell me?

355
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,260
I didn't think
there was anything wrong with it.

356
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,531
Of all the children, Donald Miller.

357
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,707
I suppose it makes sense.

358
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,972
- How does it make sense?
- He's isolated.

359
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,210
- I don't know that anything is wrong.
- Our first Negro student.

360
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,717
I thought there would be fighting.
Thought we...

361
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,624
A parent or two to deal with.

362
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,227
I should have foreseen this possibility.

363
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,524
How could you imagine it?

364
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,364
Well, it's my job
to outshine the fox in cleverness.

365
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,810
- That is my job.
- But maybe it's nothing.

366
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,247
Then why do you look like
you've seen the devil?

367
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,355
It's just the way the boy acted
when he came back to class.

368
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,428
- He said something?
- No, it was his expression.

369
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,393
He looked frightened.

370
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:30,831
And he put his head on the desk
in the most peculiar way, and...

371
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:38,040
And one other thing,
I think there was alcohol on his breath.

372
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,407
There was alcohol on his breath.

373
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,764
Years ago at Saint Boniface
there was a priest.

374
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,073
But I had Father Scully then.

375
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,443
Here, there's no man I can go to.
Men run everything.

376
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,583
We are going to have to
stop him ourselves.

377
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,458
There we go. She got him. Takes a cat.

378
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,391
Yes, it does.

379
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,133
Yes, it does.

380
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,148
This towel
will never be dead white again.

381
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,618
Yes, it will.

382
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,155
Mrs. Carson.
- I'm fine.

383
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,285
- What happened?
- There's a branch down.

384
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,259
- Are you all right, Sister?
- She didn't see it.

385
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,458
Fine. Just bushwhacked.
No need for a fuss.

386
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,501
You just go lie down.
I'll bring you some tea.

387
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,433
Come with me.
- I just...

388
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,370
I'll get you a compress.
- I did not fail to see it.

389
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,132
<i>- Hello? Yes, Sister.
- Mr. McGuinn.</i>

390
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,235
Could you look in on the courtyard?
I've got branches falling.

391
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,506
<i>- What has?
- A branch has!</i>

392
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:06,755
Watch your step here, Sister.
I'll cut it up.

393
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,485
The world is crashing, Michael.

394
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,895
I haven't heard a wind like that
since I left Mullingar.

395
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,559
I've never known a wind like it.
The wind has changed.

396
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,286
What are you doing out here, Conroy?

397
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,422
I talked in class, Father.

398
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,908
Waiting for Sister Aloysius.

399
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,579
- She know you're here?
- She knows.

400
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,148
Good morning, Father Flynn.
Good of you to come by.

401
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,226
Morning, Sister Aloysius.
How are you today?

402
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,453
I'm very well, thank you.

403
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,654
- Mr. Conroy.
- Yes, Sister.

404
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,697
Mr. Transistor Radio.

405
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,597
Multiplication table, 10 times,
in its totality,

406
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,500
delivered to me tomorrow morning.

407
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,935
Legible, boy.

408
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:34,069
Return to class. Go. Go, go.

409
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,247
I'd invite you in,
but we're just short Sister James.

410
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,991
- Hear that wind last night?
- I certainly did.

411
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:01,838
Oh.

412
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,936
Did I hear
Sister Veronica had an accident?

413
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,602
Yeah. Sister Veronica fell,
practically killed herself.

414
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,146
- Is she all right?
- Oh, she's fine.

415
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:17,343
- Her sight isn't good, is it?
- Her sight is fine. Nuns fall, you know.

416
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,483
Nah, I didn't know that.

417
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,118
It's the habit.
It catches us up more often than not.

418
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,285
Hmm.

419
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,422
We go down like dominoes.

420
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,201
- Am I past the time?
- Not at all.

421
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,860
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Sister.

422
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,131
I'm sorry I was delayed.

423
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,970
- I ran into Sister Veronica.
- How is she?

424
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,806
I'm afraid
she has a bit of a bloody nose.

425
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,006
I'm beginning to think
you're punching people.

426
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,745
Sister?

427
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,683
First, William London and now...

428
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:57,892
- Never mind. Well, come in, please.
- Sister.

429
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:03,931
Please. Sit. Have a seat.

430
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,831
I actually have a hot pot of tea.

431
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,997
And close this,
but not quite for form's sake.

432
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,241
Father, would you care for a...

433
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:19,373
- Would you have a cup of tea, Father?
- I'd love a cup of tea.

434
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,111
- Sister, perhaps you could serve him.
- I'd be glad.

435
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,550
And yourself, of course.

436
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:24,848
Would you like a cup of tea,
Sister Aloysius?

437
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,684
No, I've already had my cup.

438
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,249
- Is there sugar?
- Sugar?

439
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:38,926
Yes, yes. Somewhere here.

440
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:44,904
I put it in the drawer for Lent last year.
Never remembered to take it out.

441
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,977
It mustn't have been much
to give up, then.

442
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,548
I'm sure you're right.
Here it is.

443
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:59,249
I'll serve you, although
for want of practice I'm a little clumsy.

444
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:05,959
- I see your fingernails.
- Wear them a little long.

445
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,326
- The sugar?
- Yes. One?

446
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,627
Three.

447
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,569
- Three?
- Sweet tooth.

448
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,096
Two. Three.

449
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,303
- Sister, you care for sugar?
- Never.

450
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,414
Not that there's
anything wrong with sugar.

451
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,648
Well, thank you, Father,
for making time for us.

452
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,447
We are at our wit's end.

453
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:34,650
I think it's an excellent idea
to rethink the Christmas pageant,

454
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,852
'cause last year's effort
was a little woebegone.

455
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,829
Oh, I loved it, but I love all pageants.
The hymns.

456
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:45,333
<i>O Little Town of Bethlehem, O Come,
O Come, Emmanuel, O Come...</i>

457
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,767
All right.
Thank you, Sister James.

458
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:48,930
So what do you think, Father?

459
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,405
Is there something new we could do?

460
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,977
Well, we all love the Christmas hymns,

461
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,775
but it might be jolly
to include a secular song.

462
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,112
- Secular?
- Yes.

463
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,311
<i>It's Beginning To Look A Lot
Like Christmas. Something like that.</i>

464
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,981
What would be
the point of a secular song?

465
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,285
Just fun.

466
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,485
<i>- Or Frosty the Snowman.
- That's a good one.</i>

467
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:14,860
We could have one of the boys
dress up as a snowman, dance around.

468
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,030
Which boy?

469
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,561
We'd do tryouts.

470
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:27,234
<i>Frosty the Snowman
espouses a pagan belief in magic.</i>

471
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:31,337
The snowman comes to life when
an enchanted hat is put on his head.

472
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,915
If the music were more somber,

473
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,181
people would realize the images
are disturbing and the song heretical.

474
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,656
<i>I never thought about
Frosty the Snowman like that.</i>

475
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,885
It should be banned from the airwaves.

476
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,222
<i>So, not Frosty the Snowman.</i>

477
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:51,234
<i>Oh, It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like
Christmas would be fine, I suppose.</i>

478
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,268
Parents would like it.

479
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:59,539
May I ask what you're writing down
with that ballpoint pen?

480
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:03,010
Oh, nothing. It's an idea for a sermon.

481
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:07,076
- Oh. You had one right now?
- I get them all the time.

482
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,951
How fortunate.

483
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,452
I forget them,
so I have to write them down.

484
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,522
Oh.

485
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,751
What is the idea?

486
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,360
Intolerance.

487
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,700
Would you like
a little more tea, Father?

488
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,100
Not yet.

489
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,930
It's a new time, Sister.

490
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,238
- What's new about it?
- Something inside of people is new.

491
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,905
There is nothing new under the sun.

492
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,245
The Church needs to change.

493
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,088
We should sing a song
from the radio now and then,

494
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,885
take the kids out for ice cream.

495
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,152
Sweet tooth.

496
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,262
And maybe take the boys
on a camping trip.

497
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,990
The point being?

498
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,323
We should be friendlier.

499
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,936
You know, the children and the parents

500
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,267
should see us
as members of their family.

501
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:07,106
But we are not members of their family.
We're different.

502
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:12,181
- Why? Because of our vows?
- Precisely.

503
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,915
I don't think we're so different.

504
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,749
You know, Sister,
I would take some more tea.

505
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,915
And they think we're different, yeah?

506
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,617
The working...

507
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:28,187
The working class people of this parish
trust us to be different.

508
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,799
I think we're getting off the subject.

509
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,561
Yes, you're right. You're right.
You're right. Back to it.

510
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,173
Yes?

511
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,437
Sister Raymond? Mmm.

512
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:48,174
Well, you tell her to wash her face
and her neck and report to me at 3:00.

513
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,444
Yeah.

514
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,689
Excuse me. The Christmas pageant.

515
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,818
We must be careful

516
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,418
how Donald Miller is used
in the pageant.

517
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,693
- Easy there, Sister.
- Father.

518
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,303
All right, what about Donald Miller?

519
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,602
We must be careful, in the pageant,

520
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,703
that we neither hide Donald Miller
nor put him forward.

521
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:23,383
- Because of the color of his skin?
- That's right, yeah.

522
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,047
- Why?
- Oh, come, Father.

523
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,490
I think he should be treated
like every other boy.

524
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,794
Well, you yourself singled the boy out
for special attention.

525
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:43,730
You held a private meeting with him
at the rectory. A week ago?

526
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:44,966
Yes.

527
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:52,474
- What are we talking about?
- Donald Miller.

528
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,019
The boy acted strangely
when he returned to class.

529
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:02,885
He did?

530
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,484
When he returned from the rectory,
a little odd, yes.

531
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,994
Can you tell us why?

532
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,260
How did he act strangely?

533
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,026
He...

534
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:21,209
I'm not sure how to explain it.
He laid his head on the desk and...

535
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,748
Do you mean
you had some impression?

536
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:27,908
Yes.

537
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,519
And he'd come from the rectory,
so you're asking me?

538
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,952
Mmm. That's it.

539
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:33,951
Hmm.

540
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,251
Mmm.

541
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:36,893
Mmm.

542
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,529
Did you want to discuss the pageant?
Is that why I'm here?

543
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,496
Or is this what you wanted to discuss?

544
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,459
This.

545
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,970
Well, I'm a little uncomfortable.

546
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,904
Why?
- Why do you think?

547
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,307
The boy's well-being
is my responsibility.

548
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,747
His well-being is not at issue.

549
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:01,215
I'm not satisfied
that that is true.

550
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,446
He was upset
when he returned to class.

551
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,316
- Did he say something?
- No.

552
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,020
What happened in the rectory?

553
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,656
Happened?

554
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:14,822
Mmm.

555
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,524
Nothing happened.
I had a talk with the boy.

556
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:19,101
- What about?
- Private matter.

557
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,263
He's 12 years old.
What could be private?

558
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,505
- Should I get...
- No.

559
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,911
I object to your tone.

560
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:36,575
This is not about my tone
or your tone, Father Flynn.

561
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:42,283
- It's about arriving at the truth.
- Of what?

562
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:48,262
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you? Hmm?

563
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:53,132
And you're controlling the expression
on your face right now, aren't you?

564
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,602
My face?

565
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,765
What exactly are you accusing me of?

566
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,470
I'm not accusing you of anything,
Father Flynn.

567
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:07,175
I am asking you to tell me
what happened in the rectory.

568
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,123
I don't wish to continue this.

569
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,524
And if you're dissatisfied with that,

570
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,631
I suggest
you speak to Monsignor Benedict.

571
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:27,060
I can only imagine this unfortunate
behavior is the result of overwork.

572
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,307
Have a good morning, Sister. Sister.

573
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,749
There was alcohol on his breath

574
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,688
when he returned
from his meeting with you.

575
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:50,921
Alcohol?

576
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,093
I did smell it on his breath.

577
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:01,830
Well?

578
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,043
- Let this alone.
- No.

579
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:21,112
Take your time, Father.
Would you like some more tea?

580
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,686
You should've let it alone.

581
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,097
Not possible.

582
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,434
Mr. McGuinn caught Donald
drinking altar wine.

583
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:46,806
When I found out, I sent for him.
There were tears,

584
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:52,714
and he begged not to be removed
from the altar boys. I took pity on him.

585
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:57,323
I told him if no one else found out,
I'd let him stay on.

586
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:01,261
What a relief. That explains everything.
Thanks be to God.

587
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,334
Look, Sister, it was all a mistake.

588
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,772
And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?

589
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,069
Talk to him, by all means.

590
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,268
But now that the boy's secret's out,

591
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,107
I'm gonna have to remove him
from the altar boys.

592
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,646
That's what I was trying to avoid.

593
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,214
You were trying
to protect the boy.

594
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,181
That's right.

595
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,817
I might have done the same thing.

596
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,514
Is there a way Donald could stay
on the altar boys?

597
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:30,649
If the boy drank altar wine,
he can't continue as an altar boy.

598
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,159
Of course.

599
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,428
Are you satisfied?

600
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,126
Yes.

601
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,298
Hmm.

602
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,934
Well, I'll be going.
I have some writing to do.

603
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,437
Intolerance.
- That's right.

604
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,017
I'm not pleased
with how you handled this.

605
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,716
Sister. Sister.

606
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:07,792
Well...

607
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,561
What a relief. He cleared it all up.

608
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,300
You believe him?

609
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,842
Of course.

610
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,981
Isn't it that it's easier to believe him?

611
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,513
But we can corroborate his story
with Mr. McGuinn.

612
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:29,812
Mmm-hmm.

613
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,713
Yes.

614
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,881
These types of people are clever.

615
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,732
- Well, I'm convinced.
- You're not.

616
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,600
You just want things to be resolved
so you can have simplicity back.

617
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,930
I want no further part of this.

618
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,273
I'll bring him down.

619
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,880
How can you be so sure
that he is lying?

620
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,219
Experience.

621
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,849
You just don't like him.

622
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,926
You don't like it
that he uses a ballpoint pen.

623
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:16,555
You don't like it that he takes
three lumps of sugar in his tea.

624
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,793
<i>You don't like it
that he likes Frosty the Snowman,</i>

625
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:23,702
and you are letting that convince you
of something terrible, just terrible.

626
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,576
<i>Well, I like Frosty the Snowman!</i>

627
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,609
And I think it would be nice
if this school weren't run like a jail,

628
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,045
and I think it's a good thing
that I love to teach history

629
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,243
and that I might inspire my students
to love it, too.

630
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,321
And if you judge that to mean
that I am not fit to be a teacher,

631
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:39,945
then so be it!

632
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,991
Sit down.

633
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:57,801
Look at that. You blew out my light.

634
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:06,677
In ancient Sparta, important matters
were decided by who shouted loudest.

635
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,751
Fortunately,
we are not in ancient Sparta.

636
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,026
You honestly find the students
in this school

637
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,927
to be treated like inmates in a prison?

638
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,192
No.

639
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:30,031
Actually, they all seem fairly happy,
but they're all uniformly terrified of you.

640
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,810
Yes. That's how it works.

641
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,812
Sit there.

642
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,631
Hello, this is Sister Aloysius Beauvier,

643
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,327
principal at St. Nicholas School.
Is this Mrs. Miller?

644
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,064
I'm calling about your son, Donald.

645
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:22,218
<i>A woman was gossiping with
a friend about a man she hardly knew.</i>

646
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,518
<i>I know none of you
have ever done this.</i>

647
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,757
<i>That night she had a dream.</i>

648
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:33,562
<i>A great hand appeared over her
and pointed down at her.</i>

649
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:39,535
<i>She was immediately seized
with an overwhelming sense of guilt.</i>

650
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,170
<i>The next day she
went to confession.</i>

651
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,181
<i>She got the old parish priest,
Father O'Rourke.</i>

652
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,715
<i>She told him the whole thing.</i>

653
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:53,916
<i>"Is gossiping a sin?"
she asked the old man.</i>

654
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,221
<i>"Was that the hand of God Almighty
pointing a finger at me?</i>

655
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,957
<i>"Should I be
asking your absolution, Father?</i>

656
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:05,090
<i>"Tell me,
have I done something wrong?"</i>

657
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:09,427
<i>"Yes. " Father O'Rourke answered her.</i>

658
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:13,531
<i>"Yes, you ignorant,
badly brought up female.</i>

659
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,477
<i>"You have borne false witness
against your neighbor.</i>

660
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,481
<i>"You have played fast and loose
with his reputation,</i>

661
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,245
<i>"and you should be heartily ashamed!"</i>

662
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:29,823
<i>So the woman said she was sorry
and asked for forgiveness.</i>

663
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,593
<i>"Not so fast," says O'Rourke.</i>

664
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:38,926
<i>"I want you to go home.
Take a pillow up on your roof,</i>

665
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,801
<i>"cut it open with a knife,
and return here to me. "</i>

666
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:48,310
<i>So the woman went home,
took a pillow off her bed,</i>

667
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,402
<i>a knife from the drawer,</i>

668
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:54,510
<i>went up the fire escape to her
roof and stabbed the pillow.</i>

669
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:58,087
<i>Then she went back to the old
parish priest as instructed.</i>

670
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:02,249
<i>"Did you gut the pillow with a knife?"
he says.</i>

671
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,817
<i>"Yes, Father. "
"And what was the result?"</i>

672
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,798
<i>"Feathers," she said.</i>

673
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,930
<i>"Feathers," he repeated.</i>

674
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,608
<i>"Feathers everywhere, Father. "</i>

675
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,483
<i>"Now, I want you to go back</i>

676
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:31,486
<i>"and gather up every last feather
that flew out on the wind. "</i>

677
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,516
<i>"Well, " she said, "it can't be done.</i>

678
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,461
<i>"I don't know where they went.
The wind took them all over. "</i>

679
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:47,702
<i>"And that," said Father O'Rourke,
"is gossip!"</i>

680
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,276
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</i>

681
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,215
<i>Please rise.</i>

682
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,976
What's that bird complaining about?

683
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,414
What kind of bird is that?

684
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,423
That a starling? A grackle?

685
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:48,226
- A crow.
- Course it is.

686
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,792
Are you praying?
I didn't mean to interrupt.

687
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,766
I'm not praying. No.

688
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,467
You seem subdued.

689
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,539
Oh, I can't sleep.

690
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,076
Why not?

691
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,416
Bad dreams.

692
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,285
Yeah, I can't sleep on occasion.

693
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:14,983
Why? Do you see that big hand
pointing a finger at you?

694
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:16,983
Yes. Sometimes.

695
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,629
Was your sermon
directed at anyone in particular?

696
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,631
What do you think?

697
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:42,918
I received a letter
from my brother in Maryland.

698
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,511
He's very sick.

699
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,789
Then maybe you should go
and see him.

700
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,918
I can't leave my class.

701
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,360
Is it true?

702
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:05,667
What?

703
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,303
You know what I'm asking.

704
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:12,606
No.

705
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,313
I saw you put an undershirt
in Donald Miller's locker.

706
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:25,694
- He left it in the sacristy.
- Why didn't you hand it to him?

707
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,493
I'm trying to spare him
further embarrassment.

708
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,412
It's me that cares about that child,
not her.

709
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,289
Has she ever reached out a hand?

710
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:00,785
That black boy needs help
or he's not gonna make it.

711
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,027
If she has her way,
he'll be left to his own undoing.

712
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:06,624
Why do you think he drank the wine?
He's in trouble.

713
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,134
And she sees me talk
in a human way to these kids

714
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:16,541
and she immediately assumes that
there must be something wrong with it.

715
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:20,545
Well, I'm not gonna let her
keep this parish in the Dark Ages,

716
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,142
and I'm not gonna let her
destroy my spirit of compassion.

717
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,777
I'm sure that's not her intent.

718
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:29,653
- That I care about this congregation.
- I know you do.

719
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:34,422
Like you care about your class.
You love them, don't you?

720
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,092
- Yes.
- And that's natural.

721
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:41,565
How else would you relate to children?

722
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,001
Now, I can look at your face
and know your philosophy.

723
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,069
It's kindness.

724
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:54,006
I don't know. I mean, of course.

725
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,743
There are people
who go after your humanity, Sister,

726
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,956
that tell you that
the light in your heart is a weakness.

727
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,788
Don't believe it.

728
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:10,989
It's an old tactic of cruel people
to kill kindness in the name of virtue.

729
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,837
There's nothing wrong with love.

730
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:19,768
Love?

731
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,772
Have you forgotten the message
of our Savior?

732
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:28,112
It's love of people.

733
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,519
I just feel
as if everything is upside down.

734
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:49,695
There are just times in life
when we feel lost. It happens.

735
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,336
And it's a bond.

736
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,480
- Flowers.
- Yeah.

737
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,976
To remind me of spring.

738
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,192
I should be going.

739
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,599
I'm sorry your brother's ill.

740
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,201
Thank you, Father.

741
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,043
I don't believe it.

742
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,516
You don't?

743
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,778
No.

744
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:43,087
Thank you, Sister.
Thank you very much.

745
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,128
Hey, Anthony!
- That's not funny.

746
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,605
That's also the day
that I tripped. I broke my ankle.

747
01:02:58,741 --> 01:02:59,799
I barely...

748
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:03,207
Father. I think
I've just gotta tell somebody.

749
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,576
- Hello, Noreen.
- I'm in love.

750
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:08,641
That's wonderful. Who's the lucky boy?

751
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,276
- Jimmy Hurley.
- Have you told him?

752
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,551
For life and death,
I'd go for waffles.

753
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,385
Maybe you should.

754
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:17,849
Maybe I will, Father.

755
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,656
Jimmy!

756
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,954
Jimmy Hurley?

757
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,226
Come over here!

758
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,833
Hurry up, already!

759
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,832
Father Sherman.

760
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,572
Jimmy,
I just gotta tell you something.

761
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,013
You dropped something.

762
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,414
It's not funny.

763
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:47,682
Get out of the way.

764
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,496
It's all right.

765
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,271
He doesn't like me.
- That is so easy!

766
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,672
My parents are gonna be
so angry at me.

767
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,387
Okay. Be quiet.

768
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:29,396
I said be quiet!

769
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:34,728
The next one of you that speaks out
of turn gets sent right to the principal.

770
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,736
Now the question was,

771
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,339
what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

772
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,481
- Donald.
- Sister?

773
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,416
What was the question?

774
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:57,893
Nobody help him.
Jimmy, put your hand down.

775
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,853
Donald Miller, stand up.

776
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,897
- What was the question, Donald?
- I don't know, Sister.

777
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,840
It means you weren't listening.

778
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:15,767
Yes, Sister.

779
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:20,245
The question was, what was
Patrick Henry's famous remark?

780
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:25,786
I don't know.

781
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,287
"Give me liberty or give me death!"

782
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,187
James Hurley,
down to the principal's office.

783
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,419
Now!

784
01:05:55,648 --> 01:05:57,775
- Mrs. Miller?
- Yes.

785
01:05:57,917 --> 01:05:59,214
Come in.

786
01:06:01,154 --> 01:06:02,985
Please, have a seat.

787
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:09,584
I was changing a bulb.

788
01:06:10,329 --> 01:06:13,196
Thought I mighta had the wrong day.
You didn't answer.

789
01:06:13,299 --> 01:06:14,266
Huh?

790
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:17,666
Oh, well, just between us,

791
01:06:19,138 --> 01:06:22,904
I was listening to a transistor radio
with an earpiece.

792
01:06:23,009 --> 01:06:25,239
Look how tiny they're making them.

793
01:06:25,344 --> 01:06:27,403
I confiscated it
from one of the students,

794
01:06:27,513 --> 01:06:29,242
now I can't stop listening to it.

795
01:06:30,149 --> 01:06:31,741
You like music?

796
01:06:33,886 --> 01:06:36,013
No. News reports.

797
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:39,090
Years ago I used to listen
to all the news reports,

798
01:06:39,192 --> 01:06:42,286
because my husband was in Italy,
in the war.

799
01:06:42,395 --> 01:06:45,262
- You were a married woman?
- Yes.

800
01:06:46,232 --> 01:06:48,257
But then he was killed.

801
01:06:49,702 --> 01:06:50,926
Is your husband coming?

802
01:06:51,037 --> 01:06:53,665
Couldn't get off work.
I only have half an hour myself.

803
01:06:53,806 --> 01:06:56,800
I see. Of course. It was a lot to ask.

804
01:07:06,252 --> 01:07:08,117
How's Donald doing?

805
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:12,152
He's passing his subjects.
He has average grades.

806
01:07:12,258 --> 01:07:14,692
Oh. Good.

807
01:07:15,428 --> 01:07:17,988
He was upset about getting taken off
the altar boys.

808
01:07:18,097 --> 01:07:20,327
Mmm. Did he explain why?

809
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:23,300
He said he was caught
drinking altar wine.

810
01:07:23,402 --> 01:07:25,233
That is the reason.

811
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:28,467
Well, that seems fair.

812
01:07:30,009 --> 01:07:31,840
But he's a good boy, Sister.
He fell down there,

813
01:07:31,944 --> 01:07:34,640
but he's a good boy
pretty much down the line.

814
01:07:34,747 --> 01:07:36,510
How is he at home?

815
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:40,649
His father beat the hell out of him
over that wine.

816
01:07:40,753 --> 01:07:42,152
Oh, he shouldn't do that.

817
01:07:42,255 --> 01:07:46,055
You don't tell my husband what to do.
You just stand back.

818
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:49,895
My husband didn't want Donald
to come here.

819
01:07:50,429 --> 01:07:52,158
- Why?
- He thought he'd have trouble

820
01:07:52,265 --> 01:07:55,530
with the other boys,
but that hasn't really happened.

821
01:07:55,635 --> 01:07:56,863
Good.

822
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:00,762
That priest, Father Flynn,
been watching out for him.

823
01:08:03,142 --> 01:08:04,268
Yes.

824
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:13,051
Excuse me.

825
01:08:22,128 --> 01:08:24,119
James Hurley,
what are you doing out of class?

826
01:08:24,263 --> 01:08:26,254
- Sister James sent me down.
- What for?

827
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,232
- Talking.
- Well, go back up and shut up!

828
01:08:30,603 --> 01:08:31,865
Go! Go!

829
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:37,970
What's going on?

830
01:08:42,815 --> 01:08:46,251
None of your business.
Now go on. Go back to class.

831
01:08:47,153 --> 01:08:48,586
Bullshit.

832
01:08:48,688 --> 01:08:50,815
- What'd you say?
- Nothing!

833
01:08:57,663 --> 01:08:58,925
You have 20 minutes, you say?

834
01:09:00,466 --> 01:09:03,230
It's just that I have to walk to work.

835
01:09:03,336 --> 01:09:05,736
- Where is work?
- Parkchester.

836
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:09,171
If I don't start cleaning by noon,
I'm not home to let Donald in.

837
01:09:09,308 --> 01:09:12,471
- May I walk with you?
- I don't mind.

838
01:09:15,614 --> 01:09:17,479
Eight sixty-fourths.

839
01:09:18,517 --> 01:09:21,680
Who can tell me
what the common denominator is?

840
01:09:21,821 --> 01:09:23,083
Nobody?

841
01:09:25,024 --> 01:09:27,254
Back already, Mr. Hurley?

842
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,361
- I said, back already, Mr. Hurley?
- Leave me alone!

843
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:34,194
Who do you think you're talking to?

844
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,791
This is my classroom, boy!
Don't you forget that.

845
01:09:42,141 --> 01:09:43,506
I'm sorry.

846
01:09:50,049 --> 01:09:52,711
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

847
01:09:56,555 --> 01:09:58,682
Have you met
Father Flynn?

848
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:01,290
Just seen him on the altar.
Haven't met him face to face.

849
01:10:01,394 --> 01:10:03,828
No, just, you know, heard from Donald.

850
01:10:03,929 --> 01:10:05,294
And what does he say?

851
01:10:05,398 --> 01:10:08,026
You know,
"Father Flynn, Father Flynn. "

852
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:10,863
He looks up to him. Man gives him
his time, which is what the boy needs.

853
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:12,527
He needs that.

854
01:10:13,038 --> 01:10:15,802
Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem.

855
01:10:17,076 --> 01:10:18,976
I thought there must a been a reason
you wanting to see me.

856
01:10:19,078 --> 01:10:21,012
Principal's a big job.

857
01:10:21,881 --> 01:10:25,078
I just want to say though,
it's just till June.

858
01:10:25,217 --> 01:10:26,582
Excuse me?

859
01:10:28,421 --> 01:10:32,187
Whatever the problem is,
Donald just has to make it till June.

860
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,657
Then he's off into high school.

861
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,988
Right.

862
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:38,426
If Donald can graduate
from St. Nicholas,

863
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:41,328
he has a better chance
of getting into a good high school,

864
01:10:41,434 --> 01:10:44,562
and that would mean
an opportunity at college.

865
01:10:45,571 --> 01:10:47,266
I don't see anything at this time

866
01:10:47,406 --> 01:10:50,898
standing in the way
of his graduating with his class.

867
01:10:51,977 --> 01:10:55,105
- Well, that's all I care about.
- I doubt that.

868
01:10:55,714 --> 01:10:56,942
Try me.

869
01:10:59,752 --> 01:11:04,553
I am concerned about the relationship
between Father Flynn and your son.

870
01:11:04,657 --> 01:11:08,252
You don't say. Concerned.
What do you mean, concerned?

871
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:10,453
That it may not be right.

872
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:13,622
Well, there's something wrong
with everybody,

873
01:11:13,766 --> 01:11:17,258
and their soul gotta be forgiven.
I work right there.

874
01:11:17,636 --> 01:11:20,571
I am concerned, to be frank,

875
01:11:23,943 --> 01:11:27,743
that Father Flynn may have made
advances on your son.

876
01:11:32,017 --> 01:11:33,575
May have made?

877
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,115
I can't be certain.

878
01:11:36,255 --> 01:11:38,052
- No evidence?
- No.

879
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:41,716
Then maybe there's nothing to it.

880
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:51,726
I think there is something to it.

881
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:55,100
I think Father Flynn
gave Donald that altar wine.

882
01:11:55,207 --> 01:11:57,107
Why would he do that?

883
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:03,643
- Has Donald been acting strangely?
- No.

884
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:06,182
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- He's been himself.

885
01:12:06,318 --> 01:12:09,014
- All right.
- Look, Sister, I don't want any trouble.

886
01:12:09,154 --> 01:12:11,418
I don't... I'm not sure
you completely understand.

887
01:12:11,524 --> 01:12:13,458
I think I understand
the kind of thing you're talking about,

888
01:12:13,559 --> 01:12:16,153
but I don't want to get into it.

889
01:12:16,295 --> 01:12:17,762
What's that?

890
01:12:20,065 --> 01:12:22,761
Look, I only have a few minutes.
Not to be disagreeing,

891
01:12:22,868 --> 01:12:25,666
but if we're talking about
something floating around

892
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:28,170
between this priest and my son,
it ain't my son's fault.

893
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:30,832
- I'm not suggesting that...
- He's just a boy.

894
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:32,170
- I know.
- Twelve years old.

895
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:33,869
If someone should be taking blame,
it should be the man...

896
01:12:34,013 --> 01:12:36,004
- I know. I agree with you completely.
... not the boy.

897
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:37,376
You're agreeing with me,
but I got called

898
01:12:37,516 --> 01:12:38,642
to the principal,
if you know what I'm saying.

899
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:42,152
I am concerned about Donald's welfare.

900
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:46,382
You honestly think that priest
gave Donald that wine to drink?

901
01:12:46,525 --> 01:12:47,856
Yes, I do.

902
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,359
Then how come my son
got kicked off the altar boys

903
01:12:50,496 --> 01:12:52,521
- if it was a man that gave it to him?
- I know.

904
01:12:52,665 --> 01:12:55,190
The boy got caught, the man didn't.

905
01:12:57,903 --> 01:12:59,302
- So you're giving my son the blame.
- No.

906
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:00,372
No problem my son getting blamed,

907
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,371
- and you know why that is.
- Perhaps you should let me talk.

908
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,601
- I think you're getting upset.
- Sister, you ain't going against

909
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,007
no man in a robe and win.
He's got the position.

910
01:13:06,145 --> 01:13:09,308
- And he's got your son.
- Let him have him then.

911
01:13:11,717 --> 01:13:12,877
What?

912
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:16,952
It's just till June.

913
01:13:19,158 --> 01:13:21,524
Do you know what you're saying?

914
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:24,825
Know more about it than you.

915
01:13:26,665 --> 01:13:30,066
I believe this man is creating,

916
01:13:30,202 --> 01:13:32,295
or may have already brought about,

917
01:13:32,404 --> 01:13:34,838
an improper relationship with your son.

918
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,407
I don't know.

919
01:13:36,842 --> 01:13:38,309
I know I am right.

920
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:42,506
Why you gotta know something
like that for sure when you don't?

921
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:45,880
What kind of mother are you?

922
01:13:49,622 --> 01:13:52,591
Excuse me, but you don't know enough
about life to say a thing like that, Sister.

923
01:13:52,725 --> 01:13:53,749
I know enough.

924
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:55,757
You know the rules maybe,
but that don't cover it.

925
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:57,725
I know what I won't accept.

926
01:13:57,863 --> 01:13:59,922
You accept what you gotta accept,
and you work with it.

927
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:01,157
This man is in my school.

928
01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:02,358
Well, he's gotta be somewhere and

929
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:04,095
- maybe he's doing some good, too.
- He is after the boys!

930
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:07,535
Well, maybe some of them boys
want to get caught!

931
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:21,951
That's why his father beat him.

932
01:14:25,624 --> 01:14:27,114
Not the wine.

933
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:37,426
What are you telling me?

934
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:44,572
I'm talking about the boy's nature now,

935
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:47,969
not anything he's done.

936
01:14:49,782 --> 01:14:53,878
You can't hold a child responsible
for what God gave him to be.

937
01:14:56,488 --> 01:14:59,548
I'm only interested in actions,
Mrs. Miller.

938
01:14:59,658 --> 01:15:01,558
But then there's the boy's nature.

939
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,754
- Leave that out of it.
- Well, forget it then.

940
01:15:06,198 --> 01:15:09,224
You're the one
forcing people to say things.

941
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:13,998
My boy came to your school

942
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:17,666
'cause they were gonna kill him
in the public school.

943
01:15:20,345 --> 01:15:22,472
His father don't like him.

944
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:26,074
He come to your school,
kids don't like him.

945
01:15:26,852 --> 01:15:29,480
One man is good to him, this priest.

946
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:33,153
Then does a man
have his reasons, yes.

947
01:15:34,326 --> 01:15:37,454
Everybody does.
You have your reasons,

948
01:15:38,697 --> 01:15:41,791
but do I ask the man
why he's good to my son?

949
01:15:43,802 --> 01:15:44,928
No.

950
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:50,470
I don't care why.

951
01:15:53,979 --> 01:15:58,712
My son needs some man
to care about him

952
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:03,181
and to see him through
to where he wants to go.

953
01:16:03,655 --> 01:16:05,520
And thank God this educated man

954
01:16:05,657 --> 01:16:08,626
with some kindness in him
wants to do just that.

955
01:16:08,727 --> 01:16:11,389
- This will not do.
- It's just till June.

956
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,521
I'll throw your son out of this school.

957
01:16:13,665 --> 01:16:15,826
And why would you do that
if it didn't start with him?

958
01:16:15,934 --> 01:16:18,232
Because I will stop this.

959
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:20,133
You'd hurt my son to get your way?

960
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:23,140
- It won't end with your son.
- Throw the priest out then.

961
01:16:23,242 --> 01:16:27,338
- I am trying to do just that.
- Then what do you want from me?

962
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:36,350
Nothing.

963
01:16:40,692 --> 01:16:42,353
As it turns out.

964
01:16:43,462 --> 01:16:46,329
Please leave my son
out of this.

965
01:16:54,373 --> 01:16:58,002
My husband will kill that child
over a thing like this.

966
01:17:07,653 --> 01:17:09,052
I will try.

967
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:20,428
I'm late.

968
01:17:23,168 --> 01:17:24,430
Sister,

969
01:17:27,306 --> 01:17:30,298
I don't know if you and me
on the same side.

970
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:35,440
I'll be standing with my son
and those who are good with my son.

971
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:39,440
It'd be nice to see you there.
Good morning.

972
01:18:58,497 --> 01:19:00,021
May I come in?

973
01:19:00,732 --> 01:19:02,393
A third party would be required.

974
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:05,469
Yeah. What was Donald's mother
doing here?

975
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:08,662
- We were having a chat.
- About what?

976
01:19:08,774 --> 01:19:10,241
A third party
would truly be required, Father.

977
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:12,138
No, Sister. No third party!

978
01:19:12,244 --> 01:19:14,906
Me and you are due for a talk!

979
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:17,515
You have to stop
this campaign against me.

980
01:19:17,616 --> 01:19:20,517
- You can stop it at any time.
- How?

981
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:21,745
Confess and resign.

982
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:24,185
You are attempting
to destroy my reputation!

983
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:27,520
Who keeps opening my window?

984
01:19:29,094 --> 01:19:30,925
What are you doing in this school?

985
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:32,928
I'm trying to do good.

986
01:19:33,432 --> 01:19:35,525
Even more to the point,

987
01:19:35,634 --> 01:19:38,569
what are you doing in the priesthood?

988
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:42,902
You are single-handedly holding
this school and this parish back.

989
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:45,108
- From what?
- Progressive education

990
01:19:45,243 --> 01:19:46,403
and a welcoming church.

991
01:19:46,545 --> 01:19:48,672
You can't distract me, Father.

992
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,247
This is not about my behavior,
it's about yours.

993
01:19:50,382 --> 01:19:52,373
No, this is about
your unfounded suspicions.

994
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:55,715
- That's right. I have suspicions.
- Just leave that. It's not important.

995
01:19:55,821 --> 01:19:57,755
I will decide

996
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:02,693
what's important.

997
01:20:02,794 --> 01:20:05,558
Why do you suspect me?
What have I done?

998
01:20:07,165 --> 01:20:10,896
You gave that boy wine,
and you let him take the blame.

999
01:20:11,003 --> 01:20:13,938
That's completely untrue.
Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?

1000
01:20:14,072 --> 01:20:16,438
All McGuinn knows
is that the boy drank wine.

1001
01:20:16,575 --> 01:20:18,736
He doesn't know
how he came to drink it.

1002
01:20:18,844 --> 01:20:21,074
Did his mother
have something to add to that?

1003
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:22,271
No.

1004
01:20:23,248 --> 01:20:26,911
- So that's it.
- I am not satisfied.

1005
01:20:27,019 --> 01:20:28,782
Ask the boy then.

1006
01:20:29,354 --> 01:20:32,084
- He'd protect you.
- Why would he do that?

1007
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:36,092
- Because you have seduced him.
- You're insane.

1008
01:20:36,194 --> 01:20:38,662
You've got it in your head
that I corrupted this child

1009
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:41,823
after giving him wine,
and nothing I say will change that.

1010
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,161
That's right.

1011
01:20:43,301 --> 01:20:44,825
But this has nothing to do
with the wine.

1012
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:48,133
Not really. You've had a fundamental
mistrust of me before this incident.

1013
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:52,073
It was you that warned Sister James
to be on the lookout, wasn't it?

1014
01:20:52,177 --> 01:20:53,439
That's true.

1015
01:20:53,545 --> 01:20:55,775
- So you admit it!
- Certainly.

1016
01:20:57,382 --> 01:20:58,508
Why?

1017
01:21:00,852 --> 01:21:02,410
I know people.

1018
01:21:03,855 --> 01:21:05,322
That's not good enough.

1019
01:21:05,457 --> 01:21:08,255
- It won't have to be.
- How's that?

1020
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,988
You will tell me what you have done.

1021
01:21:12,597 --> 01:21:14,360
Oh, I will.

1022
01:21:16,401 --> 01:21:17,800
Out again.

1023
01:21:19,337 --> 01:21:22,101
Sister James is convinced I'm innocent.

1024
01:21:22,374 --> 01:21:24,706
So you talked to Sister James.

1025
01:21:25,744 --> 01:21:27,974
Well, of course
you talked to Sister James.

1026
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,139
Did you know
Donald's father beats him?

1027
01:21:30,248 --> 01:21:31,374
Yes.

1028
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:34,642
And might that not account
for the odd behavior

1029
01:21:34,753 --> 01:21:37,517
Sister James noticed in the boy?

1030
01:21:37,722 --> 01:21:39,121
It might.

1031
01:21:39,324 --> 01:21:41,189
Then what is it? What?

1032
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,290
What did you hear?

1033
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:47,729
What did you see
that convinced you so thoroughly?

1034
01:21:49,334 --> 01:21:51,165
What does it matter?

1035
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:56,370
It matters! What does it matter?
I want to know!

1036
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,188
Out this window,

1037
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:15,082
I saw you grab William London's wrist,

1038
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:19,061
and I saw him pull away.

1039
01:22:34,846 --> 01:22:36,939
- Are you serious?
- I am.

1040
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,140
That's all?

1041
01:22:40,819 --> 01:22:43,617
Yeah. That was all.

1042
01:22:47,325 --> 01:22:48,917
That's nothing.

1043
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:54,259
- What are you doing now?
- I'm writing down what you say.

1044
01:22:54,366 --> 01:22:58,962
It might be important when I have
to explain why you have to be removed.

1045
01:23:04,476 --> 01:23:07,968
This morning before I spoke
with Mrs. Miller,

1046
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:11,480
I took the precaution
of calling your last parish.

1047
01:23:12,217 --> 01:23:13,912
What did he say?

1048
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:16,515
- Who?
- The pastor.

1049
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:22,184
I did not speak to the pastor.
I spoke to a nun.

1050
01:23:23,195 --> 01:23:25,921
You should have spoken to the pastor.

1051
01:23:27,032 --> 01:23:28,294
I spoke to a nun.

1052
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,834
You know that's not the proper route
for you to have taken, Sister.

1053
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:33,836
The church is very clear. You're
supposed to go through the pastor.

1054
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:36,839
Why? You have an understanding,
you and he?

1055
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,967
No, you have no right to go rummaging
through my past!

1056
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:41,875
You have a history.

1057
01:23:42,013 --> 01:23:44,675
This is your third parish in five years.

1058
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:46,181
- Why?
- Call the pastor.

1059
01:23:46,384 --> 01:23:49,012
Ask him why I left.
It's perfectly innocent.

1060
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:51,952
- I'm not calling the pastor.
- I'm a good priest.

1061
01:23:52,057 --> 01:23:55,117
Go after another child and
another child, until you are stopped.

1062
01:23:55,227 --> 01:23:57,695
- What nun did you speak to?
- I won't say.

1063
01:23:57,829 --> 01:24:00,798
- Yeah, I've not touched a child.
- You have!

1064
01:24:01,366 --> 01:24:03,698
You haven't the slightest proof
of anything.

1065
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:05,496
But I have my certainty.

1066
01:24:05,604 --> 01:24:07,697
And armed with that,
I'll go to your last parish

1067
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:10,831
and the one before that.
If necessary, I'll find a parent.

1068
01:24:10,942 --> 01:24:13,376
Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.

1069
01:24:14,412 --> 01:24:17,404
You have no right to act on your own!

1070
01:24:18,216 --> 01:24:22,380
You have taken vows,
obedience being one!

1071
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,317
You answer to us!

1072
01:24:24,422 --> 01:24:27,414
You have no right
to step outside the church!

1073
01:24:27,559 --> 01:24:31,086
I will step outside the church
if that's what needs to be done,

1074
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:32,992
though the door should shut
behind me!

1075
01:24:33,098 --> 01:24:38,001
I will do what needs to be done,
though I'm damned to hell!

1076
01:24:38,236 --> 01:24:42,605
You should understand that,
or you will mistake me.

1077
01:24:45,744 --> 01:24:48,872
Now, did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

1078
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:52,775
Have you never done anything wrong?

1079
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:55,615
- I have.
- No mortal sin?

1080
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,356
Yes.

1081
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,526
And?

1082
01:25:12,304 --> 01:25:15,967
I confessed it, Father.

1083
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:20,870
Then whatever I have done,

1084
01:25:21,513 --> 01:25:24,880
I have left in the healing hands
of my confessor.

1085
01:25:26,184 --> 01:25:27,651
As have you.

1086
01:25:29,187 --> 01:25:30,882
We are the same.

1087
01:25:35,226 --> 01:25:36,420
Mmm-mmm.

1088
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:41,458
No, we are not. We are not the same.

1089
01:25:51,943 --> 01:25:54,776
A dog that bites is a dog that bites.

1090
01:25:57,115 --> 01:26:00,016
Did you give Donald Miller
wine to drink?

1091
01:26:01,219 --> 01:26:02,277
No.

1092
01:26:03,888 --> 01:26:05,788
Mental reservations?

1093
01:26:07,025 --> 01:26:08,117
No.

1094
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,593
You lie.

1095
01:26:16,234 --> 01:26:17,826
Very well then.

1096
01:26:20,372 --> 01:26:24,536
If you will not leave my office, I will.

1097
01:26:28,046 --> 01:26:30,947
And once I go, I will not stop.

1098
01:26:37,088 --> 01:26:38,282
Wait.

1099
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:07,814
I can't say everything, you understand?

1100
01:27:09,721 --> 01:27:11,916
There's things I can't say,

1101
01:27:13,925 --> 01:27:16,894
even if you can't imagine
the explanation, Sister.

1102
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:23,192
Remember, there are things
beyond your knowledge.

1103
01:27:24,936 --> 01:27:29,873
Even if you feel certainty,
it is an emotion, not a fact.

1104
01:27:34,612 --> 01:27:36,773
You will request a transfer

1105
01:27:38,616 --> 01:27:41,949
and take a leave of absence
until it's granted.

1106
01:27:44,656 --> 01:27:46,681
You'd leave me nothing.

1107
01:27:47,459 --> 01:27:50,053
It's Donald Miller who has nothing,

1108
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:53,227
and you took full advantage of that.

1109
01:27:53,331 --> 01:27:57,233
I've done nothing wrong.
I care about that boy.

1110
01:27:58,303 --> 01:27:59,463
Why?

1111
01:28:03,007 --> 01:28:05,066
'Cause you smile at him?

1112
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:08,374
And you sympathize with him?

1113
01:28:09,481 --> 01:28:12,473
And you talk to him
as if you were the same?

1114
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,454
You are a cheat.

1115
01:28:21,793 --> 01:28:24,557
And that warm feeling you experienced

1116
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:30,493
when that boy looked at you with trust
was not the sensation of virtue.

1117
01:28:31,936 --> 01:28:35,497
That could be got by any drunkard
with his tot of rum.

1118
01:28:37,709 --> 01:28:39,404
I can fight you.

1119
01:28:40,144 --> 01:28:41,634
You will lose.

1120
01:28:44,849 --> 01:28:46,840
Where's your compassion?

1121
01:28:49,354 --> 01:28:51,481
Nowhere you can get at it.

1122
01:28:54,893 --> 01:28:58,021
Stay here. Compose yourself.

1123
01:28:59,731 --> 01:29:02,291
You can use the phone if you'd like.

1124
01:29:03,735 --> 01:29:05,464
Good day, Father.

1125
01:29:16,848 --> 01:29:19,043
I have no sympathy for you.

1126
01:29:21,553 --> 01:29:24,681
I know you are invulnerable
to true regret.

1127
01:29:31,262 --> 01:29:33,059
And cut your nails.

1128
01:30:27,919 --> 01:30:33,585
<i>Praise God,
from whom all blessings flow</i>

1129
01:30:33,858 --> 01:30:39,023
<i>Praise him all
creatures here below</i>

1130
01:30:39,764 --> 01:30:44,997
<i>Praise him above, ye heavenly host</i>

1131
01:30:45,637 --> 01:30:51,542
<i>Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost</i>

1132
01:30:51,943 --> 01:30:57,882
<i>Amen</i>

1133
01:31:05,923 --> 01:31:08,118
<i>I never like to say goodbye,</i>

1134
01:31:11,529 --> 01:31:16,296
<i>but there is a wind behind every one
of us that takes us through our lives.</i>

1135
01:31:18,636 --> 01:31:22,572
<i>We never see it.
We can't command it.</i>

1136
01:31:24,042 --> 01:31:26,442
<i>We don't even know its purpose.</i>

1137
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,906
<i>'Cause I would have stayed
among you longer,</i>

1138
01:31:32,016 --> 01:31:34,450
<i>but that wind is taking me away.</i>

1139
01:31:39,891 --> 01:31:41,756
<i>I will miss it here,</i>

1140
01:31:43,327 --> 01:31:45,158
<i>and I will miss you.</i>

1141
01:31:46,998 --> 01:31:51,025
<i>But I'm content that the power
that propels me</i>

1142
01:31:52,236 --> 01:31:55,296
<i>does so with superior knowledge</i>

1143
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,501
<i>as to what is for the best,</i>

1144
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:02,812
<i>and that is my faith.</i>

1145
01:32:07,251 --> 01:32:09,981
<i>I would like to come down now
among you</i>

1146
01:32:10,688 --> 01:32:12,349
<i>and say goodbye</i>

1147
01:32:13,925 --> 01:32:16,189
<i>and wish you peaceful hearts</i>

1148
01:32:16,861 --> 01:32:18,624
<i>and loving hearts.</i>

1149
01:32:29,674 --> 01:32:31,505
- Goodbye, Senator.
- Father.

1150
01:32:32,577 --> 01:32:34,306
Carol. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1151
01:32:34,412 --> 01:32:36,073
Bless you, Father.

1152
01:32:36,214 --> 01:32:39,809
- Happy holidays. Susan. Bless you.
- Thank you, Father.

1153
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:42,477
- Father.
- Thank you.

1154
01:32:42,587 --> 01:32:45,021
Be good. Thank you.

1155
01:32:45,123 --> 01:32:49,059
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

1156
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:54,755
Paul. Thank you so much.

1157
01:32:55,566 --> 01:32:58,433
God bless you. Goodbye.

1158
01:33:38,643 --> 01:33:40,770
<i>...a midnight clear</i>

1159
01:33:41,179 --> 01:33:45,047
<i>A glorious song of old</i>

1160
01:33:45,583 --> 01:33:50,145
<i>From angels bending near the Earth</i>

1161
01:34:14,178 --> 01:34:17,079
Sister James. Welcome back.

1162
01:34:17,181 --> 01:34:18,580
Thank you, Sister.

1163
01:34:18,683 --> 01:34:21,345
You were missed. How is your brother?

1164
01:34:21,986 --> 01:34:23,647
Better. Much better.

1165
01:34:23,788 --> 01:34:26,814
I'm very glad. I prayed for him.

1166
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:31,324
It was good to get away.
I needed to see my family.

1167
01:34:31,429 --> 01:34:34,830
Mmm. Then I'm glad you did it.

1168
01:34:38,302 --> 01:34:40,361
And Father Flynn is gone?

1169
01:34:41,706 --> 01:34:42,832
Yes.

1170
01:34:45,877 --> 01:34:48,209
So you did it. You got him out.

1171
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,038
Yes.

1172
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,348
Donald Miller is heartbroken.

1173
01:34:55,486 --> 01:34:59,388
Can't be helped. It's just till June.

1174
01:35:03,494 --> 01:35:06,622
I don't think Father Flynn
did anything wrong.

1175
01:35:07,265 --> 01:35:09,460
No? He convinced you?

1176
01:35:10,101 --> 01:35:11,762
- Yes, he did.
- Mmm.

1177
01:35:17,708 --> 01:35:19,573
Did you ever prove it?

1178
01:35:20,845 --> 01:35:24,372
- To whom?
- Anyone but yourself?

1179
01:35:25,716 --> 01:35:26,876
Nope.

1180
01:35:27,385 --> 01:35:29,910
- But you were sure?
- Yes.

1181
01:35:34,425 --> 01:35:36,655
I wish I could be like you.

1182
01:35:38,729 --> 01:35:39,821
Why?

1183
01:35:41,465 --> 01:35:43,763
Because I can't sleep anymore.

1184
01:35:47,471 --> 01:35:51,202
Maybe we're not supposed to
sleep so well.

1185
01:35:53,978 --> 01:35:57,175
They made Father Flynn
pastor of Saint Jerome.

1186
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:02,676
- Who?
- The bishop.

1187
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:10,523
Appointed Father Flynn pastor
of Saint Jerome Church and School.

1188
01:36:12,096 --> 01:36:13,791
It's a promotion.

1189
01:36:15,232 --> 01:36:16,859
You didn't tell them?

1190
01:36:16,968 --> 01:36:21,803
Oh, I told our good monsignor.
I crossed the garden, and I told him.

1191
01:36:25,343 --> 01:36:27,868
He did not believe it to be true.

1192
01:36:31,749 --> 01:36:34,411
Then why did Father Flynn go?

1193
01:36:34,518 --> 01:36:37,112
What did you say to make him leave?

1194
01:36:37,755 --> 01:36:40,986
That I had called a nun
in his previous parish,

1195
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:47,063
that I had found out
his prior history of infringements.

1196
01:36:52,336 --> 01:36:54,133
So you did prove it?

1197
01:36:58,676 --> 01:37:00,473
I made no such call.

1198
01:37:04,682 --> 01:37:07,583
- You lied?
- Yes.

1199
01:37:08,886 --> 01:37:13,619
But if he'd had no such history,
the lie wouldn't have worked.

1200
01:37:17,161 --> 01:37:19,755
His resignation was his confession.

1201
01:37:24,835 --> 01:37:27,167
He was what I thought he was.

1202
01:37:30,207 --> 01:37:31,765
And he's gone.

1203
01:37:36,647 --> 01:37:38,672
I can't believe you lied.

1204
01:37:44,555 --> 01:37:46,819
In the pursuit of wrongdoing,

1205
01:37:47,858 --> 01:37:50,349
one steps away from God.

1206
01:37:54,031 --> 01:37:56,295
Of course, there is a price.

1207
01:38:04,842 --> 01:38:06,002
I see.

1208
01:38:14,985 --> 01:38:15,952
Oh.

1209
01:38:16,587 --> 01:38:18,054
Sister James.

1210
01:38:19,523 --> 01:38:21,252
What is it, Sister?

1211
01:38:27,531 --> 01:38:29,499
I have doubts.

1212
01:38:36,107 --> 01:38:40,441
I have such doubts.

1213
01:39:28,959 --> 01:39:35,660
<i>Come, thou,
redeemer of the Earth</i>

1214
01:39:36,033 --> 01:39:42,768
<i>And manifest thy virgin birth</i>

1215
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:49,741
<i>Let every age adoring fall</i>

1216
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:56,909
<i>Such birth befits the God of all</i>

1217
01:39:58,389 --> 01:40:05,124
<i>Begotten of no human will</i>

1218
01:40:05,529 --> 01:40:12,059
<i>But of the Spirit, thou art still</i>

1219
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:19,533
<i>The word of God in flesh arrayed</i>

1220
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:26,848
<i>The promised fruit
to man displayed</i>

1221
01:40:28,886 --> 01:40:35,621
<i>The virgin womb that burden gained</i>

1222
01:40:35,859 --> 01:40:42,423
<i>With virgin honor all unstained</i>

1223
01:40:43,067 --> 01:40:49,700
<i>The banners there of virtue glow</i>

1224
01:40:50,241 --> 01:40:57,044
<i>God in his temple dwells below</i>

1225
01:40:59,717 --> 01:41:06,452
<i>Forth from his chamber goeth he</i>

1226
01:41:06,857 --> 01:41:13,695
<i>That royal home of purity</i>

1227
01:41:14,131 --> 01:41:21,094
<i>A giant in twofold substance one</i>

1228
01:41:21,572 --> 01:41:28,501
<i>Rejoicing now his course to run</i>

1229
01:41:30,681 --> 01:41:37,644
<i>From God the Father he proceeds</i>

1230
01:41:37,988 --> 01:41:44,951
<i>To God the Father back he speeds</i>

1231
01:41:45,529 --> 01:41:52,492
<i>His course he runs
to death and hell</i>

1232
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:59,833
<i>Returning on God's throne to dwell</i>

1233
01:42:02,313 --> 01:42:09,219
<i>O equal to thy Father, thou</i>

1234
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:16,123
<i>Gird on thy fleshly mantle now</i>

1235
01:42:16,593 --> 01:42:23,522
<i>The weakness of our mortal state</i>

1236
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:31,030
<i>With deathless might invigorate</i>

1237
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:40,515
<i>Thy cradle here
shall glitter bright</i>

1238
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:47,845
<i>And darkness breathe a newer light</i>

1239
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:55,155
<i>Where endless faith
shall shine serene</i>

1240
01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:02,330
<i>And twilight never intervene</i>

1241
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:11,605
<i>All praise, eternal Son, to thee</i>

1242
01:43:13,085 --> 01:43:19,020
<i>Whose advent sets thy people free</i>

1243
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:25,960
<i>Whom, with the Father, we adore</i>

1244
01:43:26,595 --> 01:43:33,435
<i>And Holy Ghost for evermore</i>

1245
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:42,900
<i>Amen</i>
