1
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,949
<i>Sorry, I just can't give you
that kind of information.</i>

2
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,618
<i>I'll do anything else.
I just can't do that.</i>

3
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,822
<i>I can't betray my country. I won't.</i>

4
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,729
<i>This country gave me everything.</i>

5
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,496
<i>Oh, God. Just keep him away from me.</i>

6
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,037
<i>Please. Don't let him near me.</i>

7
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,368
<i>Oh, no! Oh, God!</i>

8
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,944
<i>Come on, baby. Just relax into it.
Let Godzilla do his thing.</i>

9
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,942
Come on. This is wrong
on so many levels. You in or not?

10
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,243
And get cheated again?

11
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,381
What? No, the Pooch may lie,
the Pooch may steal, the Pooch may...

12
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,253
- Refer to himself in the third person?
- Occasionally. But the Pooch won't cheat.

13
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,021
Well, the Pooch can relax.
I was worried about Cougar.

14
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,255
Yeah, right. It's always the quiet ones.

15
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:09,163
What? It's Blind Man's Bluff.
High card wins.

16
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,996
How in the hell can a man cheat you?

17
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,299
Cards.

18
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,472
Feel like I got something here.
I got something.

19
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,080
Queen, king, jack. Queen, king, jack.
All right.

20
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,182
One, two, three, go.

21
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,262
I got a great, great feeling
about this one.

22
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,266
- Your mama had a great feeling last night.
- Oh, that was a mama joke.

23
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,238
What? All right.

24
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,773
- All right, let's go.
- Okay, it's a game.

25
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,309
All right, I will raise you.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,638
- You don't wanna do that.
- Oh, no?

27
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,079
- Got this piece off that Honduran general?
- Yes.

28
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,212
Guess what? I'm definitely in.

29
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,224
- Let's go.
- All right.

30
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,416
Whoa!

31
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,030
- Should even me up.
- How many do you have?

32
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,391
What is going on here?

33
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,964
Coug, it's your bet.

34
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,565
Hey, losers!

35
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,895
It's time.

36
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,080
We got a drug and arms dealer
named Fadhil...

37
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,125
...running a homegrown terrorist assembly
line out by the Madre de Dios River basin.

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,764
We find it, we paint it for a laser-targeted
bomb, we get the hell out.

39
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,194
No muss, no fuss.

40
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,031
For that, they need us?

41
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,864
You'd rather take on 50 dudes
with AK's?

42
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,317
All right, I got eyes on Monsieur Fadhil.

43
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,389
- Paint it.
- Showtime, fellas.

44
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,459
Go ahead and call me Michelangelo.

45
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,190
Dropkick, this is Pinball.
Request fire mission.

46
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,061
The target is lased, and you are clear
to make a run from north to south. Over.

47
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,133
Roger, Pinball,
target acquired and locked.

48
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,832
Be advised, ETA fireworks,
zero eight Mikes.

49
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,839
Roger, we'll break out the earplugs.

50
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,546
Boss?

51
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,820
They're using kids as mules.

52
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,653
- Call it in.
- We have children at target site.

53
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,889
Repeat, we have eyes on children
at target site. Please advise.

54
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,533
<i>Acknowledged. Maintain position.</i>

55
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,931
Maintain position?
What is he talking about?

56
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,628
We strongly recommend cancellation
of payload delivery.

57
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,438
<i>Your orders stand. Prep for extraction.</i>

58
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,668
Cougar.

59
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,909
Dropkick, this is Pinball.

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,415
Equipment has suffered
catastrophic system failure.

61
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,951
Am calling an on-site abort.

62
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,555
<i>Well, that was just stupid.</i>

63
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,958
Is this Mission Controller?

64
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,719
<i>This is Max, Colonel Clay.</i>

65
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,656
No one uses names on comms.
This is a secure military channel.

66
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,925
<i>- Really?
- Goddamn it, listen to me.</i>

67
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,831
There are children on site.

68
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,835
<i>And you think I didn't know that?</i>

69
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,707
<i>We locked coordinates
the moment you painted.</i>

70
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,536
<i>Delivery will occur on schedule.</i>

71
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,243
<i>- Have a super day.
- You can't...</i>

72
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,506
Shit! Jensen, contact the plane directly.
Call an abort.

73
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,549
I'm trying. He's jamming us.
There's nothing I can do.

74
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,651
There's something we can do.

75
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,086
All right, here it is.
Five against the fortress.

76
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:56,285
We got maybe, what, eight minutes before
an airstrike sets the world on fire.

77
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,090
Plenty of time.

78
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,390
I'll drive.

79
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,785
Us against 50 dudes with AK's, huh?

80
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,034
Jensen, Pooch, get a truck for the kids.
Rest, out in five.

81
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:45,701
- Airstrike in four and change, ladies!
- Be out in four. Rally point. On me.

82
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,071
Three minutes to target.

83
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,660
Come on, let's go!
Out you go. Come on, kids.

84
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,001
- Okay, you go over here with him.
- Come on, mama. Come on.

85
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,337
I got this. Get them out.

86
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,942
All right, who's your papi? Let's go
this way. Let's go. Come on, let's go.

87
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,045
Ah.

88
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,947
- No.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,243
- Really?
- Why not?

90
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,851
- Can you?
- Of course.

91
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,577
Okay.

92
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,460
Ladies.

93
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,864
Up you get. Up you get.

94
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,394
<i>Clay, we gotthe kids.
Rally point, two minutes.</i>

95
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,509
Max sent you, didn't he?

96
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,107
I won't commit to his plan, he does this.

97
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:03,153
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
You let him go, I let you live.

98
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,055
Come here, son.
Come here, son. Walk to me.

99
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,427
Attaboy.

100
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,566
<i>Clay, get the hell out. We gotta go, now.</i>

101
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,201
He'll kill you too, you know.

102
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,778
<i>Target is locked. T minus 20 seconds.</i>

103
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,444
Oh, you stop for coffee in there?

104
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,320
What kind of blast radius
we looking at?

105
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,256
Okay, Pooch, I need you
to make this bus go a little faster.

106
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,693
- Everybody, hold on to something.
- Like right now!

107
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,157
I got it, I got it!

108
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,522
There we go, Pooch!

109
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,062
Whew.

110
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,171
<i>Pinball, this is Chopper 3.
Prepare for extraction.</i>

111
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,239
My favorite part was
when we were completely on fire.

112
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,610
But the shootout, that was good times.

113
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,522
There she blows.

114
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,081
Well done.

115
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,521
Let's go, let's go.

116
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,526
- All right, everyone together.
- Come on, let's go.

117
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,129
There you go. Good job.

118
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,395
Sir, there's not enough room
for your team and them.

119
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,962
Then it's them.

120
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,939
- Let's go, guys.
- All right, here we go.

121
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,102
Watch your heads.

122
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,722
You keep your bear.
You keep him safe. Okay?

123
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,786
Adios. Get them out of here.

124
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:38,505
Those are some cute little buggers.
Hope they make it to the court martial.

125
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,672
What is that? You hear that?

126
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,348
Guys, this is bad.

127
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,717
<i>Max, Cobra One, Bandit locked.</i>

128
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,050
<i>Understood.</i>

129
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,824
<i>Cobra One, kill Bandit.</i>

130
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,755
No!

131
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,207
That's supposed to be us.

132
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,206
<i>Protests today in front of
the American Embassy, a violent response...</i>

133
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,548
<i>...to the deaths of 25 Bolivian children
killed during the operation.</i>

134
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,848
Let me be perfectly clear.

135
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:03,257
In no way were these men acting
under orders from the U.S. government.

136
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,234
Is there gonna be some kind
of ceremony for them?

137
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,967
Where's the ring?

138
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,713
<i>I love you, Mommy. You're so pretty.</i>

139
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,347
<i>I love you, Mommy.</i>

140
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,774
What are you doing? No, no, no!

141
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,414
- Jeez. He's gonna get murdered.
- Come on, come on, come on.

142
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,157
This is disgusting.
All right, I'm officially disgusted by us.

143
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,595
- And you lost again.
- We lost again.

144
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,167
- No, you put the bet down.
- You gave me the money.

145
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,431
Yeah, and that was stupid of me,
wasn't it?

146
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,039
I mean, could this get any more sleazy?

147
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,810
I suppose if we started drinking.

148
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,577
You're not...? You're not drinking?

149
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,223
Come on, get him in there!

150
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,861
Thank you.

151
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,670
I found a guy online who says
he can trade intel on Max for cash.

152
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,748
- All we gotta do is make a little money.
- We don't have money.

153
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:42,217
We're gonna go PayPal-ing some kid
in a basement who's most likely lying?

154
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,652
You were there.
You know the man tried to kill us.

155
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,224
The man did kill us, Clay.

156
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,730
No, we gotta stay focused. All right?
On the mission.

157
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:58,029
Get money, get clean passports, get back
to stateside without anybody noticing.

158
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,866
- Didn't even see what he looks like.
- We heard his voice.

159
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,338
A man with a voice
is a man with a throat.

160
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,443
Come on. Clay, just look around you.

161
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,843
Do you think we're in a position
to actually take on some CIA super spook?

162
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,414
- Roque.
- It's a hell of a plan.

163
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,576
You know what? Pooch can set up
over there by the taco stand.

164
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,517
Jensen can set up communications
right there by the hookers.

165
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,487
- Captain.
- Yo! Yo.

166
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,559
You're not a soldier anymore.

167
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,629
You're not a soldier. All right?

168
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,701
Clay, for chrissakes,
you're losing the men.

169
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,873
- The men are fine.
- Yeah, well, you're losing me. All right?

170
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:41,109
He won, we lost. Just get us home.

171
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,144
Can you do that?

172
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,151
How's your steak?

173
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,488
Meaty.

174
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,990
You want a bite?

175
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,998
Maybe later.

176
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,167
Okay.

177
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,504
Do I know you?

178
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,975
Relax, Papi.

179
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,519
Do I not look relaxed?

180
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,182
No.

181
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,499
Think we can change that?

182
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,536
Wow, it's everything a girl can dream of.

183
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,572
Do you have a bathroom?

184
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,684
No, I specifically requested
the only hotel room in the world...

185
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,319
...that doesn't have a bathroom.

186
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,947
Are you trying to turn a yes into a no?

187
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,717
Oh. Thank you.

188
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,800
So, what brings you to Bolivia?

189
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,929
Cruise ship.

190
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,370
We're a landlocked country.

191
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,806
Well, it's an amazing cruise ship.

192
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,483
Where were we now?

193
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,749
Well, I think you were about to tell me...

194
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,152
...how you enjoy following me.

195
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,090
You saw me, didn't you?

196
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,355
I did.

197
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,423
I bet you didn't see me
on Mercado Street.

198
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,932
I have a business proposition
for you, Clay.

199
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,441
Oops. What happened to your accent?

200
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,671
Oops.

201
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,145
I don't wanna hurt you.

202
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,845
- You're not going to.
- Oh, yes, I am.

203
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,316
- Hi.
- Hi.

204
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,142
What do you want?

205
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,139
I can help you find Max.

206
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,449
I'm listening.

207
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,299
How did you know we were alive?

208
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,935
I counted the number of teeth
in the chopper wreckage.

209
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,372
Plus you guys aren't exactly subtle.

210
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,836
Here's the deal.
I get you and your men back in the States.

211
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,876
In exchange, you get Max for me.

212
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,244
- What's the catch, lady?
- It's pretty much a suicide mission.

213
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,113
Why should I trust you?

214
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,483
Because if I were lying, I wouldn't have
used the words "suicide mission."

215
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,228
Just meet me here tomorrow.

216
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,291
And bring your boys.

217
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,493
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

218
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,501
If you're lying to me, I'll kill you.

219
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,240
It was nice meeting you too.

220
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,639
Yes, it was.

221
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,135
I'm sorry we're late.
There was a party at the doll factory.

222
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,766
It was Pepito's birthday.

223
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,565
- Really?
- Yeah.

224
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,214
So she wanted to meet in a cemetery.

225
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,046
Because that's not,
like, foreboding at all.

226
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,987
- Am I the only one that sees this shirt?
- No.

227
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,824
Oh, it's my niece's soccer team.

228
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,484
Eight and under.
I checked their scores online and I...

229
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,730
What?

230
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,562
They're in the playoffs.

231
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,996
What do you have on her?

232
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,395
Besides a pant-busting crush?

233
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,970
Her company file is blank.

234
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,772
CIA has a standing kill order on her.
As does Hamas, Sinn F?n.

235
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,472
Pretty much everyone with the exception of
PETA wants this chick amscrayed.

236
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,644
You thinking clear on this? Because every
time you mess up, it's because of a woman.

237
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,380
- Name one time that I...
- Amber.

238
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,082
- Amber's husband was the problem.
- Her husband wasn't the one who shot you.

239
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,853
- Only in the leg.
- What about Emma?

240
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,795
- Doesn't count. I didn't sleep with Emma.
- Because she put a bomb in your car!

241
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,493
I admit, that did take a little of
the romance out of the relationship.

242
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,003
Yeah. And now this chick shows up and...
What's her name, Aisha?

243
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,666
And well, she burns down our hotel.

244
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,106
I'm clear, Roque.

245
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,544
Well, you better be,
because I ain't getting killed by no girl.

246
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,446
It's been a long time
since anyone called me a girl.

247
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,117
She put a bomb in your car?

248
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,417
She was volatile.

249
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,463
Aisha, this is Jensen,
Pooch, Roque, Cougar.

250
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,392
Really? Heh.

251
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:55,865
Gentlemen, in 97 hours,
Max will be in Miami.

252
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,204
He travels in an armored column
with at least 30 private security...

253
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,039
...armed to the teeth.

254
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,841
You have a better shot
at kidnapping the president.

255
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,452
Good news for you is I have the power
to get you guys back in the U. S...

256
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,351
...and fund the entire op as you see fit.

257
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,515
You get Max and we're square.

258
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,628
And why should we believe you?

259
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,389
Because I'm the first person you've met
who even admits he exists.

260
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,995
Listen, you guys can all stay here
in Bolivia and rot.

261
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,141
Or you can go home and get revenge
on the man that framed you.

262
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,166
It's your choice.

263
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,308
Colonel?

264
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,275
Don't call me that.
We're not soldiers anymore.

265
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,246
Okay, you know that if we do this...

266
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,581
...we are waging a war
against the Central Intelligence Agency.

267
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,885
They started it.

268
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,666
Okay, here's what I'm hearing.

269
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:01,295
I'm hearing, "No." I'm hearing, "Leave."
I'm hearing, "I'm sorry."

270
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:05,102
- Is that what I'm hearing?
- We cannot do what you ask. I'm sorry!

271
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,769
Tell me, Nabil, is this a moral issue
or a financial issue?

272
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,039
- A moral issue.
- Really?

273
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,814
You morally object to this deal?

274
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,818
- Yes, I'm sorry. Please, leave.
- Okay, so that is what I'm hearing.

275
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,980
Now I want you to listen to me,
listen carefully...

276
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,819
...because I want you to hear this.

277
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,556
Wade?

278
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,029
What is this? What are you doing?

279
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,601
No, please!

280
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,578
What the hell was that?

281
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,575
You gave me the nod.

282
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,983
A hit-him-in-the-face nod,
not a throw-him-off-the-roof nod.

283
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,419
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- At most...

284
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,721
...at most,
that was a break-his-fingers nod.

285
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,297
Jesus, Wade.
The man was a scientific genius.

286
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,630
Granted, his weight signaled certain
impulse-control issues...

287
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:10,364
...but that's no reason
to throw his fat ass off 57 floors.

288
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,202
Sorry.

289
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:19,742
I think I speak for everyone here
when I say your actions were excessive.

290
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,410
And yes, more than just a little wasteful.

291
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,191
But then, it does seem
to have had the desired effect.

292
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,524
- I'll tell you what, throw baldy off next.
- No, please. Wait.

293
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,600
We have a different moral perspective
than our late colleague.

294
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,502
I need one to test and four to use.

295
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,229
Four snukes?

296
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,039
We would need much money.

297
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,811
You will have much money.

298
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,152
Welcome back to the land of the living.

299
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,761
How do you wanna begin?

300
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,855
We're gonna go bird hunting.

301
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,177
It's a sonic de-materializer.
Better known as a snuke.

302
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,517
For the 21st-century green terrorist.

303
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,354
Pure destruction.

304
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,719
No pollution.

305
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,262
So who are we selling them to?

306
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,634
Chinese extremists, PLF,
the frigging French Basques.

307
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,829
As long as they have the right price
and are willing to use it.

308
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,167
No stockpiling, no deterrence.

309
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,402
It's like giving a handgun
to a 6-year-old, Wade.

310
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,239
You don't know how it's gonna end...

311
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,281
...but you're pretty sure
it's gonna make the papers.

312
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,008
Another war.

313
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,686
Well, what do you believe in, Wade?

314
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,846
I'm guessing shotguns and big titties.

315
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,356
I also enjoy air shows and beer.

316
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,893
We're saving the country...

317
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,160
...doing something for the benefit of
the United States of America.

318
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,303
I was born in Quebec.

319
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,138
Okay. Then we're saving North America.

320
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,276
Oops. Sorry.

321
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,311
Let me have your weapon, Wade.

322
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,320
Base 1, this is Cavalier 415!

323
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,429
We've been in a collision
with a civilian vehicle.

324
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,929
Carvey's dead
and Freeman's hurt real bad.

325
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,329
We need medevac immediately.

326
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,561
He's got kids, Base 1, he's got kids!

327
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,036
That sucked.

328
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,142
<i>- Roger, Cavalier 415.
- Come on, Jensen. You're better than that.</i>

329
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,040
<i>- Scrambling a chopper. Hang in there.
- He's got kids.</i>

330
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,612
So contrived.

331
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,750
I used to be good at that. Right, Roque?

332
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,315
- Shut up.
- Thanks, man.

333
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,650
Robert De Niro who?

334
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,322
- Jensen, shut up.
- You shut up, Roque.

335
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,687
You're dead. I'm spinal injury.
Spinal injury can talk. Dead can't.

336
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,919
Stop talking or I'll break your neck really.

337
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,462
You really gotta start getting
into character.

338
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,328
I'm serious, man. Dead guy, no talking.

339
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,762
All right.

340
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:13,267
Base 1, this is Medvac Delta.
We have visual on Cavalier 415.

341
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,007
Here we go.

342
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,347
Buddy, we'll get you patched up
in no time.

343
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,823
Oh, my God. Hi.

344
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,359
What's your name?

345
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,059
<i>Fire when ready, Cougar.</i>

346
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,832
Ow.

347
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,864
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell's going on?

348
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,613
Woo-hoo.

349
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,951
You've just been chopper-jacked, fellas.

350
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,858
Where's my wild goose?

351
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,998
The GPS?

352
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,533
Got it!

353
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,200
Have you ever seen an EMT
look like this?

354
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,400
Really, bro? "Hi, what's your name?

355
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,408
I have no legs,
but I wanna take you on a date"?

356
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,680
Yo, J.

357
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,685
What do you think is up with all this
"Don't call me colonel" stuff?

358
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,754
It's classic loss of identity.

359
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,585
Clay defined himself by his place
in military structure...

360
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,750
...his way of measuring the good he did.

361
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:40,887
Without it, he's just another loser
like the rest of us.

362
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,866
You know cats can make
a thousand different sounds...

363
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,525
...and dogs can only make ten?

364
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,500
Cats. Not to be trusted.

365
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,837
Okay, do me a favor
and never repeat that.

366
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,673
Okay? We're all set.

367
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,414
Ready to take a giant step for...

368
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,919
...guys who like to steal stuff, I guess.

369
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,654
- Hit it.
- Showtime.

370
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,327
Beautiful.

371
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,624
- Now, that's a rocket!
- Let them chase that.

372
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:17,858
That is a rocket!

373
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,298
- Wow, shit!
- Did you see that?

374
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,028
<i>Medevac Delta, this is Base 1.</i>

375
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,935
- Oh, my God.
- I'm the black MacGyver. BlaGyver.

376
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,474
<i>- What's your situation? Over.
- Time to move.</i>

377
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,403
Hi.

378
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,749
Where you from originally?

379
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,053
The wilds of Northern Africa.

380
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,855
Wow, so that must've been...

381
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,529
...sandy.

382
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,599
Do you have any hobbies?

383
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,473
When I was little, I collected human ears.

384
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,477
Good times.

385
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,041
But it's...

386
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,056
No, no, no, my friend, listen.

387
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,098
A gas turbine generator
running a force-fed rectifier unit.

388
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,360
Hook it up to the fuel tank
and... we're in the game.

389
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,200
There are few things in life that liberal
application of duct tape can't solve.

390
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,904
Are small arms gonna be a problem?

391
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,472
It's taken care of. Thanks.

392
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,439
Which brings me to my question, Aisha.

393
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,778
- What do you want with Max?
- Roque.

394
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,943
No. She did her part.

395
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,788
All right?

396
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:21,948
We got home.
I mean, we could walk right now.

397
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,321
- You can, but we made a deal.
- Fuck deals, okay?

398
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,689
You made a deal with Clay.

399
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,565
I want answers.

400
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:39,074
Max is trying
to buy next-generation weapons.

401
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,505
I don't know the endgame.

402
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,908
What I do know is when Max takes
an interest in something, people die...

403
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,482
...and world maps get redrawn.

404
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,018
Bullshit. Do you really think
you could take him on, little girl?

405
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,952
No, big boy. You are.

406
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,684
I think I'm just gonna kill her
right now, Clay.

407
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,351
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

408
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:02,260
I'm right here. You wanna shoot
your bankroll, go right ahead.

409
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,529
Roque.

410
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,135
Roque.

411
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,076
Okay, you stay with us,
but if anything smells like a trap...

412
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:19,239
...I get to put a bullet in your skull.
Does that sound fair?

413
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,975
That sounds fun.

414
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,986
Sounds like my parents.

415
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,684
- I knew you weren't gonna shoot her.
- Not today.

416
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,367
Southwest perimeter secure.

417
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,398
Load and go.

418
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,171
That's the prize. That's where Max is.

419
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,407
Yeah, I sure hope he doesn't see us
in this bright yellow banana Pinto.

420
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,051
Trying to say that you're embarrassed
to be seen in an American classic?

421
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,847
This is an American classic?

422
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,921
All right.

423
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,556
Here we go.

424
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,695
Let's see what you got.

425
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,468
Good shot.

426
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,164
Clay, where are the seatbelts, bro?

427
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,967
We don't need seatbelts.
The G-forces will hold you in your seat.

428
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,303
<i>Jensen, are we wired?</i>

429
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,070
Max is westbound.

430
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,114
And these hot dogs are delicious.

431
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,125
- This is not a sweet car, dog.
- This is a classic.

432
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,059
Yeah, this is a classic piece of shit.

433
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,131
Come on, back up! Move that car!

434
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,964
Lead vehicle hit. Give me the exits.

435
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,299
<i>Northbound and southbound are blocked.</i>

436
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:24,566
<i>We're trying to clear now.</i>

437
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,232
Dismount.

438
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,280
Form a defensive perimeter
around the package.

439
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,456
This will wake them up.

440
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,522
Masks on!

441
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,214
Oh, shit.

442
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,680
Pooch?

443
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,990
Open fire! Shoot it down now!

444
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,659
All right, here we go.

445
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,809
Goddamn.

446
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,676
We are under attack. We need backup.

447
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,218
All right, easy. Go to your right now.

448
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,993
All right, ease down, ease down,
to your left.

449
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,063
No, no, your other left. Easy, easy.

450
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,664
- Can you let me do this?
- Sure.

451
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,891
Can you let me do this?

452
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,369
That's right, bitches. I got a crossbow.

453
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,444
<i>Backdoor is sealed. Take him up.</i>

454
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:23,893
Get out of my way!

455
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,172
Whoa!

456
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,739
- You said small arms weren't a problem.
- Does that look like small arms to you, huh?

457
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:46,144
- He has a cannon down there.
- Doughnut. Doughnut, doughnut, doughnut!

458
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,850
Shit!

459
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,224
Sure you've done this before?

460
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,059
Okay, right now, not the time.
Not the time right now.

461
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,894
Pooch, what's your status?

462
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,437
Completely irritated and possibly crashing,
but fish is on the hook.

463
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,300
We got Max.

464
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,532
Barely.

465
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:32,194
Fellas. You're not gonna believe this shit.
Wade was there.

466
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,625
Wade Travis, 7th Group?

467
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:34,889
He made me, Clay.

468
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,629
No question.

469
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,065
- Who's he?
- Ran counter-guerrilla ops with him.

470
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,761
Just say he's a bad man.

471
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,164
I thought you guys were bad men.

472
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,310
- He's worse. - All right,
but right now, we need to deal...

473
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,504
...with the heavily armed evil genius
inside this truck.

474
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,943
Come on.

475
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,606
You ready?

476
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,047
Open the valve.

477
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,353
All right, let's unlock this thing.

478
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,832
Hit the ground!

479
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,763
Hit the ground or I'll blow your head off!

480
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,538
Yeah, I don't think so.

481
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,298
First and final warning.

482
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,474
Gasoline, muzzle flash, think about it.

483
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,479
Put them down.

484
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,952
Coug.

485
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,490
- Where is he?
- Who?

486
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,493
Max.

487
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:41,922
Who the hell is Max?

488
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,694
- I can explain.
- Shut up.

489
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,429
Jensen, open it.

490
00:41:58,883 --> 00:41:59,907
It's a hard drive...

491
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:04,578
...from Goliath, the multinational
manufacturer of everything.

492
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,484
I'm completely locked out.

493
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:11,287
Without a decryption key,
you're looking at a really cool paperweight.

494
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,794
Shoot her. Burn everything.

495
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,037
- Don't you wanna find out what's on it?
- No.

496
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,075
I can't find Max.

497
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,236
Nobody can.

498
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:34,714
But I knew that he was moving something
that was very valuable to him.

499
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,147
Clay!

500
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,820
Whatever it is, we can use it against him.
It's leverage!

501
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,960
The drive is proprietary technology
built by Goliath.

502
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,688
The algorithm's probably
on the mainframe.

503
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:54,070
- Come on. We're not considering that.
- Wait, wait, wait.

504
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,571
Oh, no, come on, man.
We're not the good guys anymore.

505
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,572
Twenty-five kids.

506
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:03,078
Twenty-five innocent lives lost
because of this guy. Remember?

507
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,271
- I do.
- You were there.

508
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,847
Yeah, I was there.

509
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,745
- Max is gonna pay.
- Is this a guilt trip?

510
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,217
No, I don't want him to pay.
I want my life back.

511
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:15,290
Okay? My life back.
Enough of this revenge bullshit.

512
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,623
- I'm killing her right now. - You
don't like the way I'm running things...

513
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,998
...you can find the door.

514
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,599
And go where, Clay?

515
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,394
Huh? Go where?

516
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,267
We're fugitives. Because of you.

517
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,673
What the hell are
you gonna do next, huh?

518
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,777
Put us in a box, because you got beat
by a guy on a radio?

519
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,845
- Hey, whoa.
- Okay, all right, all right.

520
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,379
- Cool out, cool out.
- You shouldn't have done that.

521
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,643
- I did do it.
- You shouldn't have done that.

522
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,376
I'm gonna cut your head off, man.

523
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,552
Bring it!

524
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,519
- Hey, get off!
- Roque.

525
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,785
They know we're alive, Roque.

526
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,889
Only thing we have to use against them
right now is that drive.

527
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,436
She framed us. Are you guys blind?
She framed us!

528
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,801
We hit Goliath Worldwide headquarters
in two days.

529
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:06,465
You want your life back?
You're gonna have to steal it.

530
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,872
You're wrong, you know that, right?

531
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,946
- Again because of a woman!
- Cut her loose.

532
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,349
Cut her loose.

533
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,182
Cut her loose, Roque.

534
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,076
You cut her loose, bro.

535
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,655
This is on you.

536
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,276
<i>We're all set, sir.</i>

537
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,746
Commence.

538
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,283
<i>- Code.
- Pulsar.</i>

539
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,984
What's pulsar?

540
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,349
What do you know about
deep space tachyons?

541
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,587
Nothing.

542
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,661
- Base-particle string theory?
- Nothing.

543
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,561
Singularity events?

544
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:05,963
Not a ton.

545
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,932
I think we should move on, then.

546
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:22,277
I'm gonna give you 45 seconds to explain
what happened to my drive.

547
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,089
And who am I looking at here, Wade?

548
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,223
Clay and his unit.

549
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:36,331
Clay and his unit?
That sounds like a porno, Wade.

550
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,297
You had them killed four months ago.

551
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,562
I've done a lot in four months, Wade.

552
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm a very busy man.

553
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,764
The Bolivia situation?

554
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:44,998
Fadhil.

555
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,802
The Max intel Fadhil gathered...

556
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,771
Was incinerated along
with everything else in the blast.

557
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,242
These guys survived.

558
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,146
And they have my drive.

559
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,016
Yeah.

560
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,886
Okay, so five dead men
hijacked you, Wade.

561
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,354
Did you happen to find out
who's behind them?

562
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,322
- Not the CIA, NSA, special ops.
- Yeah, I'm aware it's not us.

563
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,399
Seems like the only thing we do know is
who they're coming after.

564
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:18,932
Get me an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

565
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,574
- What's the plan?
- What's the plan?

566
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,977
The plan is get me
an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

567
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,710
- Okay.
- Are we clear on the plan?

568
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,081
Or we could do it a third time.

569
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,381
- Clear.
- Good.

570
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,721
Oh, Wade, you know what I was thinking?
I forgot earlier.

571
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:40,125
Get me an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

572
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,231
Are we clear?

573
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,014
Do you want some?

574
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,891
Pooch has a wife.

575
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,167
Jensen has a niece.

576
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,904
When all this is over and they go home
to their families, what are you gonna do?

577
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,235
I'll think of something.

578
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,172
They'll never let you be a soldier again.
You know that, right?

579
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:15,386
- You have no one, do you?
- Do you?

580
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,657
I got Roque.

581
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,201
You know...

582
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,364
...if you two really fought...

583
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,435
...he would kill you.

584
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,178
Why's that?

585
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,373
Because of the others.

586
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,745
You care what happens to them.

587
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,554
And you think that's a weakness?

588
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:47,823
I know it is.

589
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,324
It's the law of the jungle.

590
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,620
Well, thankfully, we're not in the jungle.

591
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,320
Yes, we are.

592
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:31,791
Good morning.

593
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:35,795
Oh, wow.

594
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,170
That's just peachy.

595
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,469
All right, look.

596
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,909
We're not going anywhere
until you two squash this bullshit.

597
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,072
- We are on a schedule here. Let's go.
- Yeah.

598
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,843
Oh, we're on a schedule. Okay.

599
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,646
What are you doing?

600
00:49:58,192 --> 00:49:59,318
Roque...

601
00:50:01,795 --> 00:50:03,854
...I'm sorry I hit you in the face.

602
00:50:05,632 --> 00:50:08,100
That was good. That was good. Roque?

603
00:50:08,902 --> 00:50:10,233
Roque?

604
00:50:10,437 --> 00:50:13,702
Clay, I'm sorry I threatened
to cut your head off.

605
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:16,502
Very good. Wow.

606
00:50:17,277 --> 00:50:19,108
Don't you two feel so much better?

607
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,804
- No.
- No.

608
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:23,381
I don't give a shit, because I do.

609
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:27,281
Now, I say we go watch Jensen
get himself killed. Yup?

610
00:50:38,465 --> 00:50:41,457
<i>A singer in a smoky room</i>

611
00:50:42,669 --> 00:50:46,070
<i>Smell of wine and cheap perfume</i>

612
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,341
<i>For a smile they can share the night</i>

613
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:54,072
<i>It goes on and on
And on and on</i>

614
00:50:54,248 --> 00:50:57,775
<i>Strangers waiting</i>

615
00:50:59,253 --> 00:51:01,585
<i>Up and down the boulevard</i>

616
00:51:10,063 --> 00:51:11,792
<i>Goliath Worldwide Enterprises.</i>

617
00:51:11,965 --> 00:51:12,989
Mr. Anderson, please.

618
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:16,796
<i>Mr. Frank Anderson, Human Resources.
One moment, please.</i>

619
00:51:22,376 --> 00:51:23,400
Wow.

620
00:51:25,946 --> 00:51:29,143
Liking the angle of the dangle? Heh.

621
00:51:29,316 --> 00:51:31,784
- Mm.
- Nice.

622
00:51:34,855 --> 00:51:35,879
This is Anderson.

623
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:38,786
Mr. Anderson, this is Richard Hertz
from Internal Security.

624
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:41,257
I'm wondering if you'd make your way
to the lobby.

625
00:51:41,428 --> 00:51:42,520
<i>What is this about?</i>

626
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:45,459
Well, it's a matter of somewhat
sensitive nature...

627
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:49,227
...involving an individual exposing himself
to women in the elevator.

628
00:51:49,403 --> 00:51:51,667
Nasty business, really.
Best discussed in person.

629
00:51:51,872 --> 00:51:53,339
All right. I'm on my way.

630
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:55,202
I'll see you there.

631
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:04,207
Thank you.

632
00:52:10,424 --> 00:52:11,755
Hi.

633
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:15,622
I'm Skippy from Tech Support, here to
install the firewall on Anderson's system.

634
00:52:15,796 --> 00:52:19,459
You just missed him. But if you want,
you can come back in, like, an hour?

635
00:52:19,633 --> 00:52:22,158
I could be out in minutes.
He doesn't have to be there.

636
00:52:22,336 --> 00:52:24,395
- You can't go in.
- Upstairs is riding me.

637
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:28,166
- But you can't... Sir...
- Thank you, I appreciate it. I like your dress.

638
00:52:30,377 --> 00:52:31,708
Dress?

639
00:52:32,746 --> 00:52:33,838
Too much.

640
00:52:36,483 --> 00:52:37,882
Algorithm's on the mainframe.

641
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:45,021
Downloading it now.

642
00:52:48,629 --> 00:52:51,598
- Skippy?
- Hey! Shit.

643
00:52:51,765 --> 00:52:53,790
- Really?
- Oh, ho, wow.

644
00:52:55,502 --> 00:52:57,697
Look, I know this probably doesn't look...

645
00:53:05,178 --> 00:53:06,611
Clay, I need an exit!

646
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,181
<i>Circle around the north
side of the building. You'll have cover.</i>

647
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:22,628
Freeze!

648
00:53:23,063 --> 00:53:24,758
Wow, this got serious.

649
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:35,102
I'm warning you.

650
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:40,303
I am a lethal killing machine.
It was a secret government experiment.

651
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,281
They did stuff to me. Spooky stuff.

652
00:53:46,987 --> 00:53:48,648
Anal stuff.

653
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:52,025
Turned me into a dangerous telekinetic.

654
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,656
As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states:

655
00:53:56,196 --> 00:54:00,098
"Don't start none, won't be none."

656
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:12,575
Telekinetic your way out of this.

657
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:14,539
- Pow.
- Ah!

658
00:54:16,316 --> 00:54:17,840
- Poof.
- Argh!

659
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:26,821
Face down, or I'll make your heart
stop beating with my mind.

660
00:54:32,466 --> 00:54:33,490
Thank you, Cougar.

661
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:45,135
- Who's got the hard drive?
- Yeah.

662
00:54:46,713 --> 00:54:49,181
And uploading the algorithm.

663
00:54:51,251 --> 00:54:52,548
And...

664
00:54:53,453 --> 00:54:57,048
Holy shit. Girlfriend was right. Ha, ha, ha.

665
00:54:57,324 --> 00:54:59,315
- It's a courier drive.
- A what?

666
00:54:59,493 --> 00:55:02,394
Twenty-first-century bagman.
Russian mob banks pioneered them.

667
00:55:02,562 --> 00:55:04,894
- Like an electronic bearer bond.
- Okay, all right.

668
00:55:05,065 --> 00:55:07,659
Say that again,
but a lot slower and dumber, please.

669
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:10,599
Okay. Pretend you are super evil.

670
00:55:10,771 --> 00:55:13,740
And you want to move
a ton of your ill-gotten blood money...

671
00:55:13,907 --> 00:55:17,035
...but you can't,
because it can be tracked.

672
00:55:17,244 --> 00:55:19,144
So you load your cash onto
this bad boy...

673
00:55:19,312 --> 00:55:21,906
...and you can physically move it
anywhere you wanna go.

674
00:55:22,082 --> 00:55:24,380
And we have Max's courier drive, right?

675
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:27,584
We have Max's $400 million.

676
00:55:29,222 --> 00:55:31,952
All right, Clay, before you go
do something noble like smashing it...

677
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,059
...I say we go on Amazon
and get a jet.

678
00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:35,524
It doesn't work that way.

679
00:55:35,696 --> 00:55:39,223
Unfortunately courier drives can only load
and unload on their home systems.

680
00:55:39,433 --> 00:55:44,097
Although if we were gonna buy stuff,
I'd say a canary-yellow stretch Hummer.

681
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:46,501
No, no. We're gonna trade it back to him.

682
00:55:46,707 --> 00:55:48,800
He's gonna get his money
and clear our names.

683
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:50,340
- No, we made a deal.
- Yes.

684
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:51,772
Aisha.

685
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:54,947
He's gotta kill us now. You know that.

686
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:57,475
Yeah, I know that.

687
00:55:57,651 --> 00:56:00,620
This has a record of every IP address
it's been jacked into.

688
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:03,620
And there's one address
that comes up a lot.

689
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:05,883
Obviously someplace
this keeps going back to.

690
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:07,117
Max's base of ops.

691
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:11,928
Port of Los Angeles.

692
00:56:14,835 --> 00:56:17,827
Thing probably has files on
every black-book op he's ever pulled.

693
00:56:18,872 --> 00:56:19,930
Including Bolivia.

694
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,435
We could hit him there,
we could clean it out...

695
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:24,975
...expose the world to what he's done.

696
00:56:25,145 --> 00:56:26,612
Clear our names in the process.

697
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,473
All right, it's a good plan.

698
00:56:31,118 --> 00:56:32,210
And we still kill him.

699
00:56:35,388 --> 00:56:36,446
Absolutely.

700
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,061
We appreciate you meeting us
at a single-story facility.

701
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:45,596
No problem.

702
00:56:45,766 --> 00:56:48,064
I view that entire incident
as your standard...

703
00:56:48,235 --> 00:56:50,669
..."getting to know each other"
business orientation.

704
00:56:50,837 --> 00:56:51,963
I agree.

705
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:53,936
But now that we do know each other...

706
00:56:54,107 --> 00:56:58,544
...know that if you ever come near me with
that Yankee Doodle, tough-guy bullshit...

707
00:56:58,712 --> 00:57:01,237
...you will be fed to my dogs.

708
00:57:03,116 --> 00:57:05,778
As you know, we had a hiccup
on our end with the money.

709
00:57:05,952 --> 00:57:08,785
One billion dollars. This is the new price.

710
00:57:08,955 --> 00:57:10,889
- One billion?
- Cash.

711
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:12,718
Cash is gonna be difficult.

712
00:57:12,893 --> 00:57:17,830
Difficult? Mr. Wade, life the way
you people want to live it is difficult.

713
00:57:17,998 --> 00:57:21,695
You want less difficult?
Move to my country. Study Hinduism.

714
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:25,929
Meditate. Cultivate serenity.
Way less difficult.

715
00:57:26,106 --> 00:57:29,098
But you want to buy bombs.

716
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:33,471
I'm afraid that's a more difficult
way of life.

717
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:35,948
Mr. Wade.

718
00:58:05,912 --> 00:58:06,936
Hello.

719
00:58:07,848 --> 00:58:10,578
He wants one billion, in cash.

720
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,183
<i>That's a lot of paper routes.</i>

721
00:58:13,453 --> 00:58:14,852
Stay wet.

722
00:58:15,722 --> 00:58:18,350
Did you get me my 18-man firing team
I asked for?

723
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:20,117
<i>- Yup.
- Okay.</i>

724
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,154
Change of plans. Kill them.

725
00:58:23,363 --> 00:58:24,853
Kill my 18 guys?

726
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:27,431
Or fire them. Whichever is easiest.

727
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:29,762
Honestly, firing them.

728
00:58:29,936 --> 00:58:32,905
Okay. Did you give them intel
on Clay's people?

729
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:36,174
- Well, yeah.
- And we're back to killing them.

730
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,802
Fine, I'll kill them.
What are we doing instead?

731
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:43,176
What's the matter? You related to them?

732
00:58:43,383 --> 00:58:44,816
Actually one of them, yeah.

733
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:46,946
Really? By blood?

734
00:58:47,153 --> 00:58:50,554
A brother-in-law. I said I'd kill him.
What are we doing?

735
00:58:51,057 --> 00:58:55,357
It's not what we're gonna do.
It's what Clay's gonna do for us.

736
00:58:55,562 --> 00:58:59,328
- And that is?
- Get us our billion, baby.

737
00:59:10,844 --> 00:59:12,072
What are we up against?

738
00:59:17,984 --> 00:59:19,008
Chryon.

739
00:59:19,185 --> 00:59:20,743
Oh, shit.

740
00:59:21,187 --> 00:59:22,449
Who's Chryon?

741
00:59:22,622 --> 00:59:25,489
Chryon Security Solutions.
Ex-Special Forces.

742
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:29,026
Basically a bunch of guys like Cougar
without the warm and cuddly side.

743
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:34,293
We start recon at 0600.

744
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:37,000
Anyone not here for it...

745
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:39,235
...I'll understand.

746
00:59:58,224 --> 01:00:00,522
I was just going over the plan.

747
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:03,519
You wanna go over the plan?

748
01:00:04,331 --> 01:00:06,390
Let's go over the plan.

749
01:00:14,774 --> 01:00:16,605
Ah, shit.

750
01:00:16,776 --> 01:00:18,107
You okay?

751
01:00:18,812 --> 01:00:21,042
Petunias are playing the Marigolds
on Sunday.

752
01:00:21,915 --> 01:00:23,473
So?

753
01:00:23,984 --> 01:00:25,975
These are the Marigolds.

754
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:27,676
Whoa.

755
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:30,185
- Those are some hard-looking 8-year-olds.
- I know.

756
01:00:30,357 --> 01:00:32,723
Look at these inmates. Heh, heh.

757
01:00:33,393 --> 01:00:34,621
What are you doing?

758
01:00:36,629 --> 01:00:41,396
I was just trying to connect
Fadhil's drug operation with Max's cash.

759
01:00:41,568 --> 01:00:44,401
There's about 4 million missing.
I'm trying to track it down.

760
01:00:45,605 --> 01:00:49,302
- What are you doing, Pooch?
- Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.

761
01:00:49,476 --> 01:00:51,103
What you need a satellite for?

762
01:00:55,715 --> 01:00:57,046
Wait a second, is that today?

763
01:00:57,617 --> 01:00:59,585
Yeah.

764
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:01,777
Probably knows
if it's a boy or a girl now.

765
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:04,116
- Congratulations, man.
- Congratulations.

766
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,416
Thank you, man.

767
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:07,958
Say that now, but you know Jolene.

768
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:10,323
She finds out I'm alive,
she's gonna kill me.

769
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:17,233
I can't let her have that baby
without me.

770
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:23,099
What? What?

771
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,940
Pooch, we all know
we're gonna die in there.

772
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:30,914
And we can do that without you.

773
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:32,846
No, you can't.

774
01:01:33,286 --> 01:01:34,685
Go home.

775
01:01:37,257 --> 01:01:38,519
Got it.

776
01:01:38,858 --> 01:01:42,225
Fadhil's 4 million didn't disappear.
It just went into a private account.

777
01:01:42,395 --> 01:01:43,726
Whose account?

778
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:45,296
It's a family trust.

779
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:48,863
Says that in the event of his death,
goes to his kid.

780
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:50,661
Name of...

781
01:01:51,037 --> 01:01:53,597
- Shit.
- Wow.

782
01:01:55,175 --> 01:01:56,699
Tell me what happened in Bolivia.

783
01:02:01,981 --> 01:02:04,142
We thought we were on a legitimate op.

784
01:02:04,684 --> 01:02:07,118
Paint a terrorist camp
so we could bomb it.

785
01:02:08,521 --> 01:02:12,252
Turns out we were just executing
some Max vendetta.

786
01:02:12,759 --> 01:02:14,784
So you knew nothing about Fadhil?

787
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:16,588
A target's a target.

788
01:02:18,198 --> 01:02:21,895
Never would have known the difference
if we hadn't seen those kids and gone in.

789
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:25,968
You went in?

790
01:02:26,539 --> 01:02:28,268
Well, yeah. We had to.

791
01:02:29,943 --> 01:02:32,241
It was 25 innocent kids in there, Aisha.

792
01:02:33,947 --> 01:02:34,971
Did you see him?

793
01:02:36,015 --> 01:02:37,744
Yeah.

794
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:40,615
Why do you wanna know all this?

795
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,447
Did you kill Fadhil, Clay?

796
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:47,487
Who are you?

797
01:02:50,163 --> 01:02:51,892
She's Fadhil's daughter, Clay!

798
01:02:52,065 --> 01:02:54,033
She's Fadhil's daughter!
Fadhil's daughter.

799
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,758
Oh, shit.

800
01:02:58,171 --> 01:03:01,629
She's got a gun and it's pointed at my dick.
Clay, it's pointed at my dick.

801
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:03,668
Rather it was pointed at your face?

802
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:05,640
I know it makes no sense, but yes.

803
01:03:07,814 --> 01:03:08,974
Better?

804
01:03:09,149 --> 01:03:10,173
Not really.

805
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,477
- Where's your gun, Jensen?
- In the van.

806
01:03:12,652 --> 01:03:14,643
- What's it doing there?
- Not much.

807
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:17,449
- Would you shut up?
- What if it was pointed at your dick?

808
01:03:53,092 --> 01:03:55,026
- Aah!
- J, where you hit?

809
01:03:55,195 --> 01:03:56,992
She shot me in my arm!

810
01:03:57,197 --> 01:03:59,131
You're gonna live. You're gonna live.

811
01:04:01,067 --> 01:04:02,591
Cougar, be gentle!

812
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,303
Clay.

813
01:04:09,842 --> 01:04:12,072
We gotta go, now.

814
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,747
Come on.

815
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:25,252
Home again, home again, jiggety-jig.

816
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:35,631
- Do you have the money?
- Jesus.

817
01:04:35,802 --> 01:04:37,770
Always with the money.

818
01:04:38,438 --> 01:04:43,273
Hi, how are you?
How've you been? Namaste?

819
01:04:43,476 --> 01:04:47,810
I recently attended the funeral of my
best friend who you had thrown off a roof.

820
01:04:47,981 --> 01:04:49,471
How have you been?

821
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:51,910
I can't complain.

822
01:04:52,085 --> 01:04:55,953
Actually I'm thinking about getting
a satellite radio for my car.

823
01:04:57,824 --> 01:04:59,314
God, you are short.

824
01:04:59,826 --> 01:05:01,555
Seriously, how much do you weigh?

825
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:03,786
Are you standing in a hole? What...?

826
01:05:04,631 --> 01:05:06,155
We have your ordnances.

827
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,561
Alrighty. Let's make a cash withdrawal.

828
01:05:12,105 --> 01:05:16,474
And who want to be a billionaire?

829
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:41,723
She burned us.

830
01:05:44,704 --> 01:05:45,966
The whole op's blown.

831
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:50,366
She knows our names, faces.

832
01:05:52,245 --> 01:05:53,940
Does she know about our families?

833
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:57,082
Damn it, Clay, look at me.

834
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,650
Does she know about our families?

835
01:06:06,926 --> 01:06:07,984
Yes.

836
01:06:12,732 --> 01:06:14,597
I gotta go home, to Springfield.

837
01:06:16,035 --> 01:06:19,129
Jensen can come with me.
His niece is in New Hampshire.

838
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,864
I'm done.

839
01:06:27,213 --> 01:06:30,808
Well, I'm going to the port, okay?

840
01:06:36,255 --> 01:06:38,587
You get back to your families.

841
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:41,157
We'll get Max.

842
01:06:41,794 --> 01:06:46,026
I did this. I made the call in Bolivia.
I put your families in danger.

843
01:06:46,232 --> 01:06:47,756
Just let me and Clay finish this.

844
01:06:47,934 --> 01:06:50,027
So you two idiots are gonna
go in there blind?

845
01:06:55,475 --> 01:06:57,033
Three.

846
01:06:58,344 --> 01:07:01,541
Hey, getting shot's great.
I'm up for doing it again.

847
01:07:02,515 --> 01:07:03,777
Four idiots.

848
01:07:10,556 --> 01:07:11,614
You sons of bitches.

849
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:18,956
I'll drive.

850
01:07:19,132 --> 01:07:20,531
Five.

851
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:55,630
We're in. Status?

852
01:07:56,135 --> 01:07:58,103
The Pooch is good.

853
01:07:59,439 --> 01:08:01,600
All right, Mojito.
It's just me and you, Papi.

854
01:08:02,742 --> 01:08:04,209
And this hot-ass van.

855
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:37,833
Hey, you!

856
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,925
And disco.

857
01:08:58,865 --> 01:09:01,197
- What's the password?
- Let us in or I'll kill you.

858
01:09:01,734 --> 01:09:03,258
Correct.

859
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:06,637
Main server is two skylights over.
I'm coming out of that door.

860
01:09:06,806 --> 01:09:10,674
Be ready to move as soon as Cougar
hits the fire alarm. Get gone.

861
01:09:26,993 --> 01:09:30,588
I'm above the computer room.
Maybe 30 seconds out.

862
01:09:31,063 --> 01:09:32,428
Shit.

863
01:09:33,165 --> 01:09:34,189
Wade's here.

864
01:09:35,535 --> 01:09:37,867
<i>Last chance to get the hell out of Dodge.</i>

865
01:09:38,104 --> 01:09:39,128
Roger that.

866
01:09:42,975 --> 01:09:44,840
- Hey, Clay.
- Yeah?

867
01:09:45,044 --> 01:09:46,102
Check this out.

868
01:09:49,849 --> 01:09:51,544
Go, Petunias.

869
01:09:55,588 --> 01:09:57,988
And the crowd goes wild.

870
01:09:58,457 --> 01:10:00,220
Where do you think you're going?

871
01:10:00,526 --> 01:10:01,618
How you guys doing?

872
01:10:01,794 --> 01:10:03,489
<i>Cougar, squelch when you're in position.</i>

873
01:10:03,663 --> 01:10:04,755
Squelch.

874
01:10:12,905 --> 01:10:14,497
Cougs? Cougs?

875
01:10:14,674 --> 01:10:16,539
Well, what do we have here?

876
01:10:17,577 --> 01:10:18,635
What's up, fellas?

877
01:10:21,547 --> 01:10:23,674
I think someone's trying to set us up.

878
01:10:25,785 --> 01:10:26,979
Jesus.

879
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:30,186
Something's not right.

880
01:10:32,725 --> 01:10:34,352
Oh, yeah?

881
01:10:49,241 --> 01:10:51,038
Hello, Clay.

882
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,742
Roque.

883
01:10:56,716 --> 01:10:58,377
Wade.

884
01:10:59,986 --> 01:11:01,453
Yeah.

885
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:06,887
After the Miami fiasco, I cut a deal, Clay.

886
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:12,223
You're a goddamn traitor.

887
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:14,161
No, you betrayed us!

888
01:11:15,034 --> 01:11:18,970
You were gonna keep planning missions, ways
to find Max, until you got us all killed.

889
01:11:19,138 --> 01:11:21,971
- No.
- Yes! I tried to tell you. You wouldn't listen.

890
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:26,202
No, you wanted your revenge.
The face-to-face with the big bad wolf.

891
01:11:26,379 --> 01:11:29,041
The voice on the radio. All that bullshit.

892
01:11:29,382 --> 01:11:30,781
Now I get to walk away.

893
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:32,416
We all would've walked, Roque.

894
01:11:35,054 --> 01:11:36,351
Don't you get it yet?

895
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,453
There's no server.

896
01:11:41,827 --> 01:11:43,488
Max lured you here.

897
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:46,791
This is a CIA cash stash.

898
01:11:47,633 --> 01:11:52,730
Kill me now
and maybe you walk away from this.

899
01:11:53,072 --> 01:11:54,562
No, you die later.

900
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:57,208
You're about to steal a billion dollars
from the CIA.

901
01:12:00,312 --> 01:12:02,007
Congratulations, Roque.

902
01:12:03,149 --> 01:12:06,414
You just helped these assholes
get everything they need to start a war.

903
01:12:09,588 --> 01:12:10,987
We cool?

904
01:12:15,928 --> 01:12:17,896
He's not my problem.

905
01:12:19,432 --> 01:12:20,797
Take him away.

906
01:12:22,168 --> 01:12:24,102
Let's get back to the boat.

907
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:27,837
Hold on. Hold on.

908
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:33,912
I followed you everywhere, man.
Everywhere.

909
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,540
Just couldn't do that shit no more.

910
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:40,648
You're gonna die very badly.

911
01:12:43,622 --> 01:12:45,021
No.

912
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:55,193
Come on, let's go.

913
01:13:01,774 --> 01:13:05,733
Do you have any fours?

914
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:08,670
Go fish?

915
01:13:11,584 --> 01:13:14,781
You actually have two fours. Two.

916
01:13:14,987 --> 01:13:17,148
You don't understand this game, do you?

917
01:13:24,296 --> 01:13:26,924
Looks like somebody's money's here.

918
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:30,301
By the way...

919
01:13:30,503 --> 01:13:32,437
...your ordnances are right here.

920
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:33,765
Tricky Vikki.

921
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,067
Four snukes and a Ducati.

922
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:41,744
As requested.

923
01:13:49,121 --> 01:13:50,145
So you're Max?

924
01:13:52,191 --> 01:13:53,624
Welcome to the team.

925
01:13:58,931 --> 01:14:01,764
Supervise the loading of the money
onto our plane.

926
01:14:02,201 --> 01:14:03,259
What do you mean?

927
01:14:06,405 --> 01:14:07,463
What do you mean?!

928
01:14:08,707 --> 01:14:10,698
New change of plan.

929
01:14:29,495 --> 01:14:30,792
Roque.

930
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:33,288
Move.

931
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:36,160
Move it. Let's go.

932
01:14:42,174 --> 01:14:44,836
- Get down on your knees.
- You heard him.

933
01:14:53,986 --> 01:14:55,010
No?

934
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:02,583
Pooch!

935
01:15:03,796 --> 01:15:06,731
- Son of a bitch!
- You know, I like that hat.

936
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:08,559
That's a great hat.

937
01:15:09,735 --> 01:15:11,430
Hey.

938
01:15:13,072 --> 01:15:15,302
I really don't care if there's a hole in it.

939
01:15:20,913 --> 01:15:22,642
What are you smiling at?

940
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:29,352
Now that's a bad-ass chick.

941
01:15:57,449 --> 01:15:58,643
Payback's a bitch.

942
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:06,619
Never touch the hat. Hm?

943
01:16:19,705 --> 01:16:21,332
Can you stand?

944
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:23,771
I've been shot in both of my legs.

945
01:16:23,943 --> 01:16:26,411
What kind of dumbass question
is that? Really?

946
01:16:26,578 --> 01:16:28,205
So now we're Mr. Grumpy Pants.

947
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,678
You're not the only one
who's been shot today.

948
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,709
Dude, you're standing.

949
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,317
Back it up.

950
01:16:40,492 --> 01:16:44,121
I'm gonna need you
to arm this device right now.

951
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:47,861
Extremists are about to be framed for
cratering the great Port of L.A.

952
01:16:48,033 --> 01:16:51,298
- You are insane.
- I am engineering a global terrorist conflict...

953
01:16:51,503 --> 01:16:55,530
...that's finally gonna restore some order
to this big blue marble.

954
01:16:56,976 --> 01:16:59,968
Now light the firecracker.

955
01:17:13,025 --> 01:17:14,390
Cougs.

956
01:17:16,495 --> 01:17:17,519
Clay!

957
01:17:18,497 --> 01:17:19,896
Did you kill him?

958
01:17:22,968 --> 01:17:25,698
My father found out about
Max's real plans.

959
01:17:25,871 --> 01:17:28,101
He was gonna stop him.

960
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:31,467
Did you kill him?

961
01:17:34,546 --> 01:17:35,979
Yes.

962
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:42,045
- Aisha, he was a bad man.
- It doesn't matter!

963
01:17:42,721 --> 01:17:44,313
I know.

964
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,290
You can kill me right now.

965
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:51,224
Or you can let me help you do
what you need to do.

966
01:17:52,364 --> 01:17:55,561
Either way, I get it.

967
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,538
Let's go get Max.

968
01:18:13,018 --> 01:18:15,111
Wade said boat.
That means we're at the docks.

969
01:18:15,287 --> 01:18:16,549
Pooch, can you stand?

970
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:20,021
Oh. Oh, this is stupid question day.

971
01:18:20,192 --> 01:18:22,717
This is stupid question day.
Nobody decided to tell me.

972
01:18:22,895 --> 01:18:26,422
- No, that's cool. That's awesome.
- Come on, Legless Pooch. I got you.

973
01:18:27,366 --> 01:18:29,459
- Here we go.
- All right, let's move.

974
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:32,194
This isn't over yet.

975
01:18:57,596 --> 01:19:01,930
Come on, fellas. I hate to rush you,
but I got a plane to catch.

976
01:19:06,004 --> 01:19:07,062
Come on!

977
01:19:26,825 --> 01:19:29,487
There you go, there you go!
Get it in there, let's go!

978
01:19:31,663 --> 01:19:34,393
I got Roque. Rest of you get Wade.
Cougar, run point cover.

979
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:36,727
Legless Pooch and I are on it.
Come on, buddy.

980
01:19:40,973 --> 01:19:44,272
Call me Legless Pooch again,
you're gonna be Headless Jensen.

981
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:48,304
I think it's a cool name.
Makes you sound like a pirate.

982
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,538
Your mama's a pirate.

983
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,623
Go!

984
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,425
Cover me!

985
01:20:17,009 --> 01:20:19,273
- Get us in the air.
- We don't have room for lift.

986
01:20:19,444 --> 01:20:22,174
Hey, do as you're told!
Go down there and turn around!

987
01:20:27,653 --> 01:20:29,177
- Shit!
- Damn it.

988
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:45,228
You know, I always wondered
how this was gonna play out, Clay.

989
01:20:45,404 --> 01:20:47,872
I told you already. You die very badly.

990
01:20:48,974 --> 01:20:50,168
Oh, yeah?

991
01:20:50,909 --> 01:20:51,933
All right.

992
01:21:07,926 --> 01:21:09,791
Oh, my God.

993
01:21:13,599 --> 01:21:15,590
Jensen, run! Run!

994
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:31,310
- Now I'm definitely gonna cut your head off.
- Go for it.

995
01:21:36,989 --> 01:21:39,423
Son of a bitch!

996
01:21:54,473 --> 01:21:55,599
You lose!

997
01:22:10,622 --> 01:22:12,783
We're clear to take off.
Get us out of here.

998
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:13,982
Okay, all right.

999
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,524
- Get us out of here.
- Okay!

1000
01:22:16,528 --> 01:22:18,996
The ordnance is live.

1001
01:22:19,598 --> 01:22:21,691
And this is the remote trigger.

1002
01:22:23,835 --> 01:22:26,668
<i>Detonation in ten, nine...</i>

1003
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,304
That son of a bitch is stealing our cash!

1004
01:23:01,973 --> 01:23:04,635
<i>Clay, Wade's on the move.</i>

1005
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:06,272
<i>Clay!</i>

1006
01:23:06,678 --> 01:23:09,010
<i>You got Wade coming at you!</i>

1007
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,022
- Run him over.
- What?

1008
01:23:23,195 --> 01:23:24,219
Run him over!

1009
01:23:43,615 --> 01:23:44,946
Take him.

1010
01:24:16,314 --> 01:24:17,941
Outstanding.

1011
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:29,025
<i>Clay, we got a situation here.</i>

1012
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:32,891
<i>I'm looking at a giant, vibrating
Easter egg from hell and no Max.</i>

1013
01:24:33,064 --> 01:24:34,156
I think I see him.

1014
01:24:34,332 --> 01:24:37,460
Initiate backup plan C.

1015
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:41,168
The one where you rescue me.

1016
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:54,448
Shit.

1017
01:25:01,326 --> 01:25:03,226
ETA? I'm at rendezvous.

1018
01:25:06,698 --> 01:25:07,722
Hello?

1019
01:25:08,633 --> 01:25:09,725
Hello?

1020
01:25:10,969 --> 01:25:14,166
What's the matter? Crappy reception?

1021
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,847
- That was my ride.
- Bummer.

1022
01:25:27,619 --> 01:25:29,519
- Clay, is it?
- Colonel.

1023
01:25:29,688 --> 01:25:31,315
So you know what this is, then?

1024
01:25:31,523 --> 01:25:33,821
- Remote pressure trigger.
- Very good.

1025
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:37,558
I release the button for ten seconds
and everything goes boom.

1026
01:25:39,331 --> 01:25:41,663
So since you can't shoot me...

1027
01:25:44,135 --> 01:25:45,568
Goddamn it!

1028
01:25:45,737 --> 01:25:47,204
You wanna try that again?

1029
01:25:48,907 --> 01:25:50,306
That hurt.

1030
01:25:52,978 --> 01:25:55,037
Having fun? Enjoying yourself?

1031
01:25:55,213 --> 01:25:56,942
Give me the trigger, I let you live.

1032
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:59,481
You know the worst thing about
being the good guy?

1033
01:25:59,684 --> 01:26:00,708
What's that?

1034
01:26:03,154 --> 01:26:04,781
Having to make decisions like this.

1035
01:26:39,124 --> 01:26:42,582
Hey! Ha, ha, ha. Look what Pooch found!

1036
01:26:42,794 --> 01:26:44,125
Look what I found.

1037
01:26:44,896 --> 01:26:46,420
This should do it.

1038
01:26:52,103 --> 01:26:53,127
Disarmed.

1039
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:57,169
Hello?

1040
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:02,779
It's Max.

1041
01:27:08,253 --> 01:27:09,379
Hi, Max.

1042
01:27:09,554 --> 01:27:11,920
<i>Colonel. Nice catch.</i>

1043
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:16,117
<i>We could've shared the dream together.
Now you're back to where you started.</i>

1044
01:27:16,294 --> 01:27:18,524
Yeah, well, I wouldn't go that far.

1045
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:19,959
<i>Why's that?</i>

1046
01:27:20,131 --> 01:27:22,622
Well, now I know what you look like.

1047
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:25,435
Be seeing you soon, Max.

1048
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:38,640
It's a nice watch, homes.

1049
01:27:47,092 --> 01:27:48,616
Come with us.

1050
01:27:50,629 --> 01:27:54,429
When this is over and he's dead...

1051
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,600
...you and I are gonna finish that dance.

1052
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:00,970
Fair enough.

1053
01:28:03,775 --> 01:28:06,335
Yo, let's go home.

1054
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:08,709
She is volatile.

1055
01:28:18,957 --> 01:28:20,652
Poppa, Poppa, we are clear.

1056
01:28:21,459 --> 01:28:23,086
Setting perimeter.

1057
01:28:24,029 --> 01:28:25,496
You're five by.

1058
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,166
I'm a little nervous
about this one, colonel.

1059
01:28:33,038 --> 01:28:35,973
Whatever happens, you get to that package.

1060
01:28:43,481 --> 01:28:45,972
- Mission is live.
- Acknowledged.

1061
01:28:48,553 --> 01:28:50,020
I'm in.

1062
01:29:00,699 --> 01:29:04,601
Okay. The Pooch can do this.

1063
01:29:07,372 --> 01:29:09,897
The Pooch can do this.

1064
01:29:17,582 --> 01:29:18,947
Hey.

1065
01:29:19,117 --> 01:29:20,607
Sir, you can't come in here.

1066
01:29:20,785 --> 01:29:22,082
It's okay.

1067
01:29:24,089 --> 01:29:25,249
I'm the father.

1068
01:29:25,757 --> 01:29:27,247
Where the hell have you been?

1069
01:29:28,927 --> 01:29:30,292
Traffic.

1070
01:29:32,797 --> 01:29:33,957
Traffic?

1071
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,206
<i>It's a boy. It's a boy, Clay.</i>

1072
01:29:46,377 --> 01:29:48,845
<i>- And he looks just like me.
- Congrats.</i>

1073
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,115
Cheers.

1074
01:30:18,576 --> 01:30:21,443
<i>- We're taking a big chance here.
- They're getting slaughtered.</i>

1075
01:30:29,854 --> 01:30:33,346
Come on, ref! Watch number nine!
She's throwing elbows!

1076
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:34,855
- Shh.
- Shh.

1077
01:30:36,294 --> 01:30:38,023
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1078
01:30:39,898 --> 01:30:42,264
Hi. My niece, number 21.

1079
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:44,163
She's the star of the team.

1080
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:48,304
- Diaper change.
- What?

1081
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:53,976
- Colonel, you wanna jump on this for me?
- I'd rather jump on a live grenade.

1082
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:56,545
I'm invested.
I have 100 dollars on this game.

1083
01:30:56,748 --> 01:30:59,182
Who'd you find to bet
on a girls' soccer game with?

1084
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:01,079
Yeah.

1085
01:31:01,252 --> 01:31:02,583
You bet against the Petunias?

1086
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,153
Well, he gave me points.

1087
01:31:04,355 --> 01:31:05,913
Big mistake.

1088
01:31:06,324 --> 01:31:07,985
Let's go, girls. Let's go, girls!

1089
01:31:11,396 --> 01:31:12,727
Oh, no.

1090
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:18,801
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?
Are you all right?

1091
01:31:19,003 --> 01:31:23,463
- What is that? That is a foul! Are you blind?
- Get off the field, sir! Are you blind?

1092
01:31:23,675 --> 01:31:25,336
Hey, boss, boss.

1093
01:31:25,977 --> 01:31:28,912
- Get off the field!
- You're not gonna blow your whistle?

1094
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1095
01:31:30,882 --> 01:31:32,281
- Better...
- Yeah, we should.

1096
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:34,782
- A girl kicked to the ground is not a foul?
- Get off!

1097
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:38,218
I wanna know who you work for!
How high up does this go?

1098
01:31:38,423 --> 01:31:39,583
Get off the field!

1099
01:31:39,757 --> 01:31:41,918
This is worse than the NBA!

1100
01:31:42,126 --> 01:31:43,218
Okay, come on.

1101
01:31:43,695 --> 01:31:45,424
Come on. Loser!

1102
01:31:45,597 --> 01:31:47,462
You don't deserve to wear those stripes!
