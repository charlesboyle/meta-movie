00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,650
WOMAN:
Good night, sweetheart.

2
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,630
BOY:
Good night, Mom.

3
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,780
MAN:
Sleep tight, kiddo.

4
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,790
( light switch clicks )

5
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,590
( door closes )

6
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,590
( owl hooting )

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
( owl hooting )

8
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,160
( ticking )

9
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,370
( wind blowing gently )

10
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,260
( door creaking open )

11
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,710
( gasps softly )

12
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,200
( wind blowing )

13
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,510
( gasps )

14
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,070
( wind whistling )

15
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,140
( gurgling snarl )

16
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,130
( screaming )

17
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,610
( screaming louder )

18
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,600
Whoa!

19
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,630
( shrieking )

20
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,350
( screaming )

21
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,720
Oh! Aye! Oh! Oh!

22
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,840
( shrieking )

23
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,140
( alarm blaring )

24
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,410
( yelps )

25
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,390
COMPUTER VOICE:
Simulation terminated.

26
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,840
Simulation terminated.

27
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,250
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,050
Simulation terminated.

29
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,220
All right,
Mr. Bile, is it?

30
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,870
Uh... my friends
call me Phlegm.

31
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,040
Uh-huh.

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,230
Mr. Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

33
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,440
I fell down?

34
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,280
No, no, before that.

35
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,040
Can anyone tell me
Mr. Bile's big mistake?

36
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,600
Anyone?

37
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,260
( coughs )

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,130
( groans )

39
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,670
Let's take a look
at the tape.

40
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,760
Here we go.

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,850
Uh, right...
puh-puh-puh-puh...

42
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,380
Ah! There, see?

43
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,330
The door.
You left it wide open.

44
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,210
( whimpers )

45
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,010
( all murmuring )

46
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,970
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

47
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,710
any employee can make
because...?

48
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,540
Um... it could let in a draft?

49
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,060
It could let in

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,140
a child!

51
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,440
Oh! Mr. Waternoose!

52
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,130
There is nothing more toxic
or deadly than a human child.

53
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,470
A single touch could kill you!

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,520
Leave a door open

55
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,490
and a child could walk
right into this factory!

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,530
Right into the monster world!

57
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,950
I won't go
in a kid's room!

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,970
You can't make me!

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,960
You're going in there
because we need this.

60
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,290
( children screaming )

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,210
( whimpering )

62
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,410
( static and feedback )

63
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,410
( screaming stops )

64
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,570
Our city is counting on you

65
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,830
to collect those children's
screams.

66
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,650
Without scream,
we have no power.

67
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,780
Yes, it's dangerous work

68
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,750
and that's why I need
you to be at your best.

69
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,810
I need scarers who are
confident, tenacious

70
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,690
tough, intimidating.

71
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,130
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.

72
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,310
( snoring )

73
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,180
Hey! Good morning,
Monstropolis.

74
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,560
It's now five after
the hour of 6:00 A.M.

75
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,030
in the big monster city.

76
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,790
Temperature's a
balmy 65 degrees--

77
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,750
which is good news
for you reptiles--

78
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,170
and it looks like it's
going to be a perfect day

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,250
to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in

80
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,110
or simply... work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

81
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,680
Get up, Sulley!

82
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,470
--( screaming )
--( honking )

83
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,390
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

84
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,530
Hey! Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

85
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,090
--Feel the burn!
--( growling )

86
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,560
You call yourself
a monster?

87
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,580
( growling )

88
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,030
Scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet!

89
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,210
Oop! The kid's awake!

90
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,950
Okay, scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet, scary feet--

91
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,990
kid's asleep!

92
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,990
( roaring )

93
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,250
Twins! In a bunk bed!

94
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,600
( growling )

95
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,080
Ooh! I thought I had you there.

96
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,580
Okay, Sulley, here we go.

97
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
You ready? Follow it.

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh! It's over here!

99
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,190
Oh, look over there!

100
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,650
Don't let the kid
touch you!

101
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,770
Don't let it touch you!

102
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,610
* I don't know,
but it's been said *

103
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,250
* I love scaring kids in bed! *

104
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,200
Come on, fight that plaque!
Fight that plaque!

105
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,690
Scary monsters
don't have plaque!

106
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,960
1 18... do you have 1 19?

107
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,590
Do I see 120?

108
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,910
Oh, I don't believe it!

109
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,370
I'm not even
breaking a sweat.

110
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,390
Not you!

111
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,640
Look! The new
commercial's on!

112
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,820

113
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,970

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,650
ANNOUNCER:
We're part of your life.

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,790
We power your car.

117
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,020
We warm your home.

118
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,800
We light your city.

119
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,570
I'm Monsters, Incorporated.

120
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,890
Hey, look! Betty!

121
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,250
ANNOUNCER:
Carefully matching every child
to their ideal monster...

122
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,310
--( roars )

123
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,300
to produce superior scream

124
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,360
refined into clean,
dependable energy.

125
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,730
Every time you turn something on

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,070
Monsters, Incorporated,
is there.

127
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,050
I'm Monsters, Incorporated!

128
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,790
ANNOUNCER:
We know the challenge--

129
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,720
the window of innocence
is shrinking.

130
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,140
Human kids are harder to scare.

131
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,800
Of course, M.I. is prepared
for the future

132
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,090
with the top scarers...

133
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,200
( child screaming )

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,780
the best refineries

135
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,670

--( yelling )
--( shrieking )

137
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,860
Okay, here I come.

138
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,570
We're working for a better
tomorrow... today!

139
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,120

WATERNOOSE:
We're M.I.--

141
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,470
We scare because we care.

142
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,070
I can't believe it.

143
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,190
Oh, Mike...

144
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,700
I was on TV!

145
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,370
Did you see me?
I'm a natural!

146
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,400
( phone rings )

147
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,430
Hello.

148
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,440
I know!

149
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,440
Hey, wasn't I great?

150
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,690
Did the whole
family see it?

151
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,870
It's your mom.

152
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,060
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

153
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,880
( bicycle bell rings )

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm telling you, big daddy

155
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,230
you're going to be seeing this
face on TV a lot more often.

156
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,190
Yeah? Like, on
Monstropolis@s Most Wanted?

157
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,490
( mocking laughter )

158
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,980
You've been jealous
of my good looks

159
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,160
since the
fourth grade, pal.

160
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,620
Have a good day, sweetie.

161
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,820
You, too, hon.

162
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,840
Whoo!
Okay, Sulley, hop on in.

163
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,970
Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

164
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

165
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,260
Where you going?
What are you doing?

166
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,150
Mikey, there's a scream
shortage. We're walking.

167
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,280
--Walking?!
--Yep.

168
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,250
No, no, no, my baby.

169
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,250
Come on. Come on.

170
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,450
Look, she needs
to be driven.

171
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,960
Bye, baby.
I... I'II call you!

172
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,820
MIKE:
Hey, genius,
you want to know why

173
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,180
I bought the car? Huh?

174
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,190
Not really.

175
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,290
To drive it!

176
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,650
You know, like,
on the street?

177
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,020
With the honk-honk
and the vroom-vroom

178
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,040
and no walking involved.

179
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,040
( mock whining )

180
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,550
Give it a rest,
will you, butterball?

181
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,210
Come on, you could
use the exercise.

182
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,660
I could use
the exercise?!

183
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,730
Look at you.
You have your own climate!

184
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,020
GIRL MONSTERS:
How many tentacles
jump the rope?

185
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,690
BOY MONSTER:
Morning, Mike!
Morning, Sulley!

186
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,710
Hey! Morning, kids.

187
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,720
Hey, kids.

188
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,720
How you doing?

189
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,420
Bye, Mike!
Bye, Sulley!

190
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,220
BIG EYE:
Ow! Hey!

191
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,250
( humming )

192
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,990
( sneezing )

193
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,640
Ah, nuts.

194
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,660
( singing )

195
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,340
Hey, hey, hey! Fellas!

196
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,370
Hey, Tony!

197
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,750
Tony! Ba-da-bing!

198
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,810
--Tony!
--Hey, Tony!

199
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,780
Pow, pow,
pow, pow, pow!

200
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,320
I hear somebody's
close to breaking

201
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,340
the all-time
scare record.

202
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,600
Ah, just trying
to make sure

203
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,060
there's enough scream
to go around.

204
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,150
( laughing )

205
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,440
Hey! On the house!

206
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,410
--Hey, thanks!
--Grazie!

207
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,220
MIKE:
Ba-da-bing!

208
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,990
( startled gasp )

209
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,950
Oh, great.

210
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,060
Hey, Ted!

211
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,600
Good morning!

212
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,080
( clucking )

213
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,260
See that, Mikey?

214
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,720
Ted's walking to work.

215
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,990
Big deal.

216
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,770
Guy takes five steps
and he's there.

217
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,390
( phones ringing )

218
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,120
FEMALE MONSTER:
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

219
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,370
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

220
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,420
Morning, Sulley.

221
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,420
Morning, Ricky.

222
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,460
Hey, it's
the Sullster!

223
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,620
See you on the scare floor,
buddy!

224
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,820
Hey, Marge.
Hey, how was jury duty?

225
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,430
Morning, Sulley!

226
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,810
Hey!

227
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,980
Hey, it's still
leaning to the left.

228
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,260
It is not!

229
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,270
Hey, fellas.

230
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,270
Hey, Jerry.

231
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,620
Hey, Mr. Sullivan!

232
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,430
Guys, I told you,
call me Sulley.

233
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,510
( nervous giggling )

234
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,510
I don't think so.

235
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,470
We just wanted to wish
you good luck today.

236
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

237
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,900
Come on, get lost,
you two.

238
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,360
You're making him
lose his focus.

239
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,350
Oh. Sorry.

240
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,350
See you later,
fellas.

241
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,220
Go get 'em,
Mr. Sullivan!

242
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,340
Quiet! You'II make
him lose his focus.

243
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,420
Oh, no. Sorry!

244
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,390
Shut up!

245
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,260
-( phones ringing )
-Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

246
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,450
Monsters, Inc.
I'II connect you.

247
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,790
Ms. Fearmonger is on vacation.

248
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,020
Would you like her voice mail?

249
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,800
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.

250
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,670
-( snakes squealing )
-Googley Bear!

251
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,870
Happy birthday.

252
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,480
Oh, Googley-woogley,
you remembered!

253
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,870
Hey, Sulley-wulley.

254
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,200
Oh, hey, Celia...

255
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,340
weelia.

256
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,050
( clears throat ):
Happy birthday.

257
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,400
Thanks.

258
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,340
So, uh... are we going
anywhere special tonight?

259
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,860
I just got us
into a little place

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,950
called, um...
Harryhausen's.

261
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,000
( gasps )

262
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,190
Harryhausen's?!

263
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,350
But it's impossible to
get a reservation there!

264
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,390
Not for Googley Bear.

265
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,110
I will see you
at quitting time

266
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,420
and not a minute later.

267
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,500
Okay, sweetheart.

268
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,930
Think romantical
thoughts.

269
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,060
* You and me *

270
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,490
* Me and you *

271
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,890
* Both of us together! *

272
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,310
You know, pal, she's the one.

273
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,730
That's it.
She is the one!

274
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,330
I'm happy for you.

275
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, and, uh,
thanks for hooking me up

276
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,440
with those reservations.

277
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,170
Oh, no problem.

278
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,580
They're under the
name Googley Bear.

279
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,630
Oh, good ide...

280
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,780
You know,
that wasn't very funny.

281
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,960
( gasps )

282
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,270
What the...?

283
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,270
Wazowski!

284
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,240
( screams )

285
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,460
( grunts )

286
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,480
( chuckling )

287
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,730
What do you know?

288
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,600
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

289
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,710
I wasn't scared.

290
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,990
I have... allergies.

291
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,150
( coughing )

292
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,760
Uh-huh. Sure.

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
Hey, Randall, save it for
the scare floor, will you?

294
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,330
I'm in the zone today,
Sullivan.

295
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,280
Going to be doing
some serious scaring.

296
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
Putting up some big numbers.

297
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,930
Wow, Randall.

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,930
That's great.

299
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,630
That should make it
even more humiliating

300
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,950
when we break the record first.

301
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,490
Ha, ha!

302
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,110
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

303
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,420
Do you hear that?

304
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,390
It's the winds of change.

305
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,540
( mocking voice ):
''You hear it?
You hear the winds of ch...?''

306
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,870
Oh, what a creep.

307
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,100
One of these days,
I am really...

308
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,780
going to let you
teach that guy a lesson.

309
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,370
( deep croaking )

310
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,780
( liquid squishing )

311
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,940
Chalooby! Baby!

312
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,080
MIKE:
Good morning, Roz

313
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,070
my succulent
little garden snail.

314
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,660
And who would
we be scaring today?

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,010
Wazowski, you didn't file
your paperwork last night.

316
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,690
Oh, that darn paperwork.

317
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,250
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

318
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,480
( chair squeaking )

319
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,900
Don't let it happen again.

320
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,500
Yes, well, I'II, uh...

321
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,910
I'II try to be less careless.

322
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,340
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

323
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,420
Always watching.

324
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,470
Whoo! She's nuts.

325
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,430
Always!

326
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,580
CELIA ( over PA ):
All scare floors are now active.

327
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
Assistants, please report
to your stations.

328
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,870
( metallic clunk )

329
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,470
( machine beeps, bell dings )

330
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,500
( bell dings )

331
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,980
( clanking and whirring )

332
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,680
( chime rings )

333
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,320
Okay, people, eastern seaboard
coming on-line.

334
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,360
We got scarers coming out!

335
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,900
( dramatic brass fanfare
playing )

336
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,210
Ooh, they're
so awesome.

337
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,700
( knuckles cracking )

338
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,580
( clanging and growling )

339
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,910
( snarls )

340
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,920
( blowing )

341
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,150
( growling )

342
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,430
Hey... may
the best monster win.

343
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,920
I plan to.

344
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,040
( bell ringing )

345
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,870
We are on in seven... six...

346
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,600
five... four... three...

347
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,740
two...

348
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,380
( horn blaring )

349
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,290
( growls )

350
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,940
You're the boss.
You're the boss.

351
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,090
You're the big,
hairy boss.

352
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,290
( child screaming )

353
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,090
( bell dings )

354
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,380
Oh, I'm feeling good today,
Mikey!

355
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,440
Yeah!

356
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,700
MIKE:
Whoa!

357
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,030
Attaboy.
Attaboy.

358
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,360
Another door coming right up.

359
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,010
( whirring and clanking )

360
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,370
( child screaming )

361
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,480
( bell dings )

362
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,320
( growling )

363
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,640
You're still behind,
Randall.

364
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,740
You know, maybe I should realign
the scream intake valve.

365
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,890
Just get me
another door!

366
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,920
A door! Yes, door!

367
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,400
( child screaming )

368
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,200
( bell dings )

369
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,490
( bells dinging )

370
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,510
( beeping )

371
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,410
( metallic clanking )

372
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,410
( click and hiss )

373
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,940
( children screaming )

374
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,290
( bells dinging )

375
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,720
( children screaming )

376
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,730
Well, Jerry, what's
the damage so far?

377
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,390
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

378
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,380
Hmm. First time
in a month.

379
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,580
( gurgling and burping )

380
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,140
Huh?!

381
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,490
( door buzzing )

382
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,460
( screaming and sobbing )

383
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,980
What happened?

384
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,170
The kid almost
touched me!

385
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,560
She got this close
to me!

386
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,860
She wasn't
scared of you?

387
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,040
She was only six!

388
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,430
I could've been dead!

389
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,410
I could've died!

390
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,600
Keep it together, man.

391
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,810
( whistling )

392
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,430
Hey! We got a dead
door over here!

393
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,930
--We're coming!
--Coming!

394
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,630
--Look out!
--Out of the way!

395
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,620
--Coming through!
--Excuse us.

396
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,160
( whimpering )

397
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,800
We've lost 58 doors
this week, sir.

398
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,820
Oh, kids these days.

399
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,560
They just don't get
scared like they used to.

400
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,690
Let her rip!

401
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,500
( buzzing )

402
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,670
( metallic clank )

403
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,350
( eerie blubbering )

404
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,420
( child screaming )

405
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,420
( bell dings )

406
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,420
Uh, sir?

407
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,420
What?!

408
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,000
Look.

409
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,210
CELIA ( over PA ):
Attention.

410
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,310
We have a new scare leader:
Randall Boggs.

411
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,490
( snickering )

412
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,130
( assistants cheering )

413
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,150
( children screaming )

414
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,360
( knuckles cracking )

415
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,340
Slumber party.

416
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,340
( laughing )

417
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,430
Whoo!

418
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,980
( beeping )

419
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,560
CELIA ( over PA ):
Never mind.

420
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,380
Hey! Watch it!

421
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,760
( Sulley laughing )

422
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,670
Well, James, that was
an impressive display!

423
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,780
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr. Waternoose.

424
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,910
Of course, I did
learn from the best.

425
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,280
( both laughing )

426
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,410
If I don't see a new door at
my station in five seconds

427
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,260
I will personally put you
through the shredder!

428
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,430
( screams )

429
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,140
Hey, Wazowski, nice job!

430
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,680
Those numbers
are pretty sweet.

431
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,090
Are they?

432
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,550
You know,
I hadn't even noticed.

433
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
And, uh...
how is Georgie doing?

434
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,330
He's doing great!

435
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,730
I love working
with that big guy.

436
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,740
( child screaming )

437
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,970
Keep the doors coming,
Charlie.

438
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,140
I'm on a roll today.

439
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,920
George and I
are like brothers.

440
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,980
( gasping )

441
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,580
2319! We have a 2319!

442
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,680
( gasping )

443
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,340
( alarm blaring )

444
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,540
COMPUTER VOICE ( over PA ):
Red alert! Red alert!

445
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,080
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!

446
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,640
FEMALE ( over PA ):
George Sanderson

447
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,430
please remain motionless.

448
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,690
Prepare for decontamination.

449
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,020
Get it off!

450
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,610
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!

451
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,850
Oh, not the CDA.

452
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,070
( siren wailing )

453
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,990
CDA AGENT:
Move! Move! Move!

454
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,600
Coming through, please.
Stand aside.

455
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,970
CDA AGENT 2:
Clear the contaminated area.

456
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,990
( screams )

457
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,760
CDA AGENT:
This is a 2319 in progress.

458
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,760
Keep the area clear.

459
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,980
Coming through.
Watch yourself.

460
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,190
( grunts )

461
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,580
( whimpering )

462
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,450
Stand back.

463
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,370
Careful.

464
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,660
( metallic clang )

465
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,990
( drills whirring )

466
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,350
( all gasping )

467
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,500
( muff
ed explosion )

468
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,130
( drills whirring )

469
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,470
All clear.

470
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,130
Situation is niner-niner-zero.

471
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,730
Ready for decon.

472
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,920
Hey, thanks, guys.

473
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,150
That was a close one.

474
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,610
Okay.

475
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,590
( shears buzzing )

476
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,340
( screaming )

477
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,360
( whimpering )

478
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,330
( ripping )

479
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,620
( screaming )

480
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,050
JERRY:
Okay, people, take a break!

481
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,460
We got to shut down
for a half-hour

482
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,640
and reset the system.

483
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,250
An entire scare floor
out of commission.

484
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,310
What else can go wrong?

485
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,060
Oh... what a day.

486
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,950
We're just going through
a rough time, sir.

487
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,140
Everyone knows you're going
to get us through it.

488
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,120
Tell that to the
board of directors.

489
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,700
( slurping )

490
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,400
James, this company

491
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,190
has been in my family
for three generations.

492
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,350
I would do anything to
keep it from going under.

493
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,790
Oh, so would I, sir.

494
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,250
Well...

495
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,000
Say, I could use your help
with something.

496
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,620
Anything, sir.

497
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,700
You see, we've hired
some new scare recruits

498
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,710
and frankly, they're...
they're, um... uh...

499
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,360
Inexperienced?

500
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,930
Oh, they stink!

501
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,270
Uh-huh.

502
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,150
And I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

503
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,770
and give them a demonstration.

504
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,870
Show them what it takes
to be a top scarer, huh?

505
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,070
I'II start out with the old
Waternoose jump-and-growl.

506
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,770
( growling loudly )

507
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,760
Ha! Oh, oh, yes!

508
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,220
Now, that's my boy!

509
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,650
( both laughing )

510
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,620
( ringing )

511
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,720
JERRY:
Let's go, everybody!

512
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,200
All doors must be returned!

513
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,890
No exceptions!

514
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,720
--Oh, yeah.
--Whoo!

515
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,650
I've never seen anything
like you today.

516
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,980
You were on
a roll, my man.

517
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,090
Another day like this

518
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,410
and that scare record's
in the bag.

519
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,400
That's right, baby!

520
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
Uh-huh.

521
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,110
So get this--
as if dinner wasn't enough

522
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,230
I'm taking her to a monster
truck rally afterwards.

523
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,270
Nice.

524
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,630
What's on your agenda?

525
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm going to head home
and work out some more.

526
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,340
Again? You know, there's
more to life than scaring.

527
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,510
( sniff'
ng )

528
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,830
Whew. Hey, can I
borrow your odorant?

529
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,400
Yeah. I got, uh...

530
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,270
smelly garbage or old dumpster.

531
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,350
You got low tide?

532
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,360
No.

533
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,360
How about wet dog?

534
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,390
Yep. Stink it up.

535
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,160
( growling )

536
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,510
You know, I am so romantic

537
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,270
sometimes I think
I should just marry myself.

538
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,580
Give me a
break, Mike.

539
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,130
What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.

540
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,460
Tonight is about me

541
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,300
and Celia.

542
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,940
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.

543
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,010
( imitating ship horn )

544
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,230
'Cause I got
to tell you, buddy

545
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,430
that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

546
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,480
Yikes!

547
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,670
Hello, Wazowski.

548
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,470
Fun-filled evening
planned for tonight?

549
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,510
Well, as a
matter of fact...

550
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,320
Then I'm sure you
filed your paperwork

551
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,060
correctly... for once.

552
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,850
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

553
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,930
Oh, no. My scare reports--
I left them on my desk

554
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,960
and if I'm not at the restaurant
in five minutes

555
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,190
they're going to give
our table away!

556
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,200
What am I going to tell...

557
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,200
Schmoopsie-poo.

558
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,780
Hey, Googley Bear.
Want to get going?

559
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,000
Do I ever!
It's just that...

560
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,170
What?

561
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,210
Uh, you know,
there's a small....

562
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,470
I don't understand.

563
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,250
It's just that I forgot
about some paperwork

564
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,470
I was supposed to file.

565
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,090
Mike was reminding me.

566
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,220
Thanks, buddy.

567
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,340
Whoo.

568
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,800
I was? I mean, I was!
Yeah, I was.

569
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,210
Oh, okay.
Let's go then.

570
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,220
We're going!

571
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,220
On my desk, Sulley.

572
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,510
The pink copies
go to Accounting

573
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,880
the fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing

574
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,120
and goldenrod ones
go to Roz.

575
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,130
Huh!

576
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,290
Leave the puce.

577
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,050
SULLEY:
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.

578
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,290
No, fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing.

579
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,200
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

580
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,940
Man, I have no idea
what puce is.

581
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,170
Oh, that's puce.

582
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,750
Hmm?

583
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,650
Uh, hello?

584
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,980
Anyone?

585
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,340
There's a door here.

586
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,390
Hmm.

587
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,120
( door latch clicking )

588
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,660
( door creaking )

589
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,050
( whispering ):
Hello?

590
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,050
Hey.

591
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,050
Psst.

592
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,790
Anybody scaring in here?

593
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,780
Hello?

594
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,860
Yo!

595
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,420
Hmm.

596
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,470
( thump )

597
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,580
( thump )

598
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,610
( thump )

599
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,740
( speaking baby talk )

600
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,490
( screams )

601
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,440
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

602
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,550
Oh!

603
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,830
( giggling ):
Here.

604
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,110
Gotcha!

605
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,990
( yells )

606
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,190
( squeals in delight )

607
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,230
Eh!

608
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,310
( giggling )

609
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,910
( yells )

610
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,840
( giggles )

611
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,440
( gasps, then whimpers )

612
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,330
( squeals in delight )

613
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,980
( giggling )

614
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,140
( laughs )

615
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,300
Oh!

616
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,210
( loud crashing, toy squeaking )

617
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,630
Yeow!

618
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,850
( gasps )

619
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,760
( toy ducks quacking )

620
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,860
( yelling )

621
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,860
( toy ducks quacking )

622
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,300
( quacking )

623
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,440
Eww.

624
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,920
( toy ducks quacking )

625
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,300
( sighs )

626
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,290
( yells )

627
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,630
( panting )

628
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,030
( toys quacking and squeaking )

629
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,340
( squeaking )

630
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,040
Whew.

631
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,500
( Sulley screams )

632
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,060
( little girl
speaking baby talk )

633
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,560
Kitty!

634
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,770
( speaking baby talk )

635
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,780
No, no-- stay back.

636
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,230
( speaking baby talk )

637
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,210
( stutters in fear )

638
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,250
( giggling )

639
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,430
( speaking baby talk )

640
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,370
( whine of disgust )

641
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,280
( little girl
speaking baby talk faintly )

642
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,270
( whimpers )

643
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,660
( door latch clicking )

644
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,070
Hmm.

645
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,850
( speaking baby talk )

646
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,020
( faint squeal
of delight )

647
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,510
( sneezes )

648
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,460
( murmur of conversation )

649
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,180
( knives being sharpened )

650
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,300
PHOTOGRAPHER:
And hold it.

651
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,390
( shutter clicks )

652
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,080
ALL:
Get a paper bag!

653
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,000
Mmm.

654
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,500
( laughing )

655
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,070
Oh, Michael, I've had
a lot of birthday...

656
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,800
well, not a
lot of birthdays

657
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,960
but this is the
best birthday ever.

658
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,000
Hmm.

659
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,130
What are you
looking at?

660
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,300
I was just thinking

661
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,270
about the first time
I laid eye on you--

662
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,440
how pretty you looked.

663
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,570
Stop it!

664
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,870
Your hair was
shorter then.

665
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,390
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking
about getting it cut.

666
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,420
( faint squeal of fear )

667
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,610
No, no, I like
it this length.

668
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,620
( sighs of relief )

669
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,170
I like everything
about you.

670
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,320
Just the other day

671
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,640
someone asked me who I thought

672
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,590
the most beautiful monster was
in all of Monstropolis.

673
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,660
You know what I said?

674
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,080
What did you say?

675
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,100
I said...

676
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,570
--Sulley?
--Sulley?

677
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,700
No! No, no.

678
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,050
That's not
what I was going to say.

679
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,610
Mike, you're not making sense.

680
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,280
SULLEY:
Hi, guys!

681
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,790
What a coincidence,
running into you here!

682
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,390
Uh, I'm just going
to order something to go.

683
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,350
Michael...

684
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,350
Sulley!

685
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,570
I wonder what's good here.

686
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,090
Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

687
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,270
I went back to get
your paperwork

688
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,280
and there was a door.

689
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,320
What?

690
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,330
( rattling )

691
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,360
A door?!

692
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,320
Randall was in it.

693
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,320
Wait a minute.
Randall?

694
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,360
That cheater!

695
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,190
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

696
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,550
There's something else.

697
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,560
What?!

698
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,820
Ook-lay in the ag-bay.

699
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,830
What?!

700
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,830
Look in the bag.

701
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,600
What bag?

702
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,790
( sighs )

703
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,770
( gasps )

704
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,510
( giggling )

705
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,800
Oh!

706
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,070
They don't have
anything I like here.

707
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,050
So take care, Celia!

708
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,110
Excuse me, sir.

709
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,110
What's going on?

710
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,560
Celia, please try
to understand.

711
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,490
I have to do something!

712
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,520
Michael?

713
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,130
PHOTOGRAPHER:
On three.

714
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,380
One... two....

715
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,390
( squeals and giggles )

716
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,350
( screaming )

717
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,390
A kid!

718
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,620
Boo!

719
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,330
( all screaming )

720
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,360
A kid!

721
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,240
There's a kid here--
a human kid!

722
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,980
( exclaiming in baby talk )

723
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,970
Oh!

724
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,390
CELIA:
Googley Bear!

725
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,830
( yelling )

726
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,100
( blows raspberry )

727
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,280
Come on!

728
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,540
( monsters screaming in terror )

729
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,880
MIKE:
Let's get out of here!

730
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,170
CDA HELICOPTER PILOT:
Please remain calm.

731
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,390
This is not a drill.

732
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,300
( siren wailing,
tires screeching )

733
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,320
CDA AGENT 1 :
We have an 835 in progress.

734
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,370
Please advise.

735
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,620
Michael? Michael?

736
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,830
Oh, Celia.

737
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,420
--Please come with me.
--Ow. Stop pushing.

738
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,370
Hey, get your hands off
my Schmoopsie-poo!

739
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,690
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.

740
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,730
Well, I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

741
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,910
( explosion )

742
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,560
( electrical buzzing )

743
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,460
If witnesses are to be believed

744
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,710
there has been
a child security breach

745
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,040
for the first time
in monster history.

746
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,550
We can neither confirm nor deny

747
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,690
the presence of a human child
here tonight.

748
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,410
Well, a kid flew right over me

749
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,780
and blasted a car
with its laser vision!

750
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,150
I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up

751
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,710
with its mind powers
and shook me like a doll!

752
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,680
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!

753
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,340
It is my
professional opinion

754
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,270
that now is the time
to... panic!

755
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,710
Oh-oh.

756
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,810
( both yelling )

757
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,110
Oh, it's coming!

758
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,450
It's coming!

759
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,320
( giggling ):
Boo!

760
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,580
( both screaming )

761
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,520
( distant sirens wailing )

762
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,300
( delighted cry )

763
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,140
( yelling )

764
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,620
No, no, no, no, no!

765
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,800
Come here, kid.

766
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,840
Whee.

767
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,560
No, don't touch those,
you little...!

768
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,580
Oh, now

769
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,680
those were alphabetized.

770
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,840
It's okay, it's all right.

771
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,230
As long as it doesn't
come near us

772
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,250
we're going to be okay.

773
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,250
( sneezes )

774
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,410
( screams )

775
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,480
( yelling in pain )

776
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,840
( whimpering in fear )

777
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,080
Wanna ride on it!

778
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,460
Da, da-da.

779
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,460
Da-da-da.

780
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,520
Oh, y-you like this?

781
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,530
Fetch!

782
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,530
( giggles )

783
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,140
( gasps )

784
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,580
Hey, hey, that's it!

785
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,560
No one touches
little Mikey!

786
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,440
( whining )

787
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,440
Mike, give her the bear.

788
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,210
Oh, no.

789
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,010
( piercing scream )

790
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,500
( electrical buzzing )

791
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,230
( screaming and crying
continue )

792
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,340
( buzzing continues )

793
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,590
( exclaiming in fear )

794
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,910
Make it stop, Sulley!

795
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,190
Make it stop!

796
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,480
Look!
See the bear?

797
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,590
Ooh, nice bear.

798
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,600
( screams )

799
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,760
Sulley!

800
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,900
See?

801
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,130
Ooh, bear, ooh.

802
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,870
Oh, he's
a happy bear.

803
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,550
* He's not crying,
neither should you *

804
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,020
* Or we'II be
in trouble *

805
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,170
* 'Cause they're gonna find us *

806
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,300
* So please stop crying *

807
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,440
* Right now. *

808
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,610
Good, good, Sulley.
Keep it up.

809
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,900
You're doing great.

810
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,270
* Ooh, the happy bear,
he has no... *

811
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,510
( screaming )

812
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,870
She touched me!

813
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,950
Sulley, the bear!

814
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,930
The bear!

815
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,020
Give her the...

816
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,540
Whoa!

817
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,510
( giggles )

818
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,980
( screaming with laughter )

819
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,860
( electrical buzzing
grows louder )

820
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,000
( light bulb shatters )

821
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,040
( giggles )

822
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,710
What was that?

823
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,770
( thumping )

824
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,770
I have no idea

825
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,610
but it would be
really great

826
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,250
if it didn't
do it again.

827
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,470
( giggles )

828
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,930
Shh, shh, shh.

829
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,140
Shh...

830
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,210
shh.

831
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,020
Shh...

832
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,320
Ah!

833
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,060
How could I do this?

834
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,550
How could I be so stupid?

835
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,180
This could destroy
the company.

836
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,210
The company?

837
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,690
Who cares
about the company?!

838
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,710
What about us?

839
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,220
That thing is
a killing machine!

840
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,370
* La-la-la-la-la-la *

841
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,410
I bet it's just waiting
for us to fall asleep

842
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,610
and then wham!

843
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,420
Oh, we're easy prey,
my friend-- easy prey.

844
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,380
We're sitting targets.

845
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,390
Okay, look, I think

846
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,770
I have a plan here.

847
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,000
Using mainly spoons, we dig
a tunnel under the city

848
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,060
and release it into the wild.

849
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,210
Spoons.

850
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,710
That's it, I'm out of ideas.

851
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,240
We're closed.
Hot air balloon?

852
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,970
Too expensive.
Giant slingshot?

853
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,000
Too conspicuous.

854
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,130
Enormous wooden horse?
Too Greek!

855
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,410
( speaking baby talk )

856
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,570
No plan. No plan.

857
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,950
Can't think.
Can't think.

858
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,050
Flatlining.

859
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,050
Uh, Mike?

860
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,300
I think she's getting tired.

861
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,250
Well, then
why don't you

862
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,790
find someplace
for it to sleep?

863
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,490
While I think of a plan!

864
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,760
Are you sleepy?

865
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,820
You want to sleep?

866
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,020
ls that what you want?

867
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,420
Huh?

868
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,490
( crunching )

869
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,960
Okay, all right.

870
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,560
I'm making a nice little area
for you to...

871
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,780
( giggling )

872
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,420
No. Hey, hey,
that's my bed!

873
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,960
You're going to get
your germs all over it.

874
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,150
( sighing ):
Fine.

875
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,570
My chair is
more comfortable anyway.

876
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,040
( yells )

877
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,060
What?

878
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,290
( speaking fearfully )

879
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,030
it's just a closet.

880
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,160
Will you go to sleep?

881
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,770
Hey, that looks like Randall.

882
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,280
Randall's your monster.

883
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,300
You think he's going
to come through the closet

884
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,380
and scare you.

885
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,410
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

886
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,520
Uh, it's empty.

887
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,970
--See?
--Ah!

888
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,720
No monster in here.

889
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,840
Well, now there is

890
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,460
but I'm not going to scare you.

891
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,690
I'm off-duty.

892
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,050
Okay.

893
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,400
How about I sit here,
until you fall asleep?

894
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,800
Go ahead.

895
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,290
Go to sleep.

896
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,310
Now.

897
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,240
Now... go.

898
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,640
Uh, you...

899
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,910
go...

900
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,120
to...

901
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,190
sleep.

902
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,800
( imitating snoring )

903
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,270
( giggles )

904
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,430
( sighs in relief )

905
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,790
( door creaks softly )

906
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,270
Hey, Mike,
this might sound crazy

907
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,260
but I don't think
that kid's dangerous.

908
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,510
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

909
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,650
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

910
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,050
Now, look.

911
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,840
What if we just put
her back in her door?

912
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,380
What?

913
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,440
Mike, think about it.

914
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,050
If we send her back,
it's like it never happened.

915
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,140
Everything goes back to normal.

916
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,140
Is that a joke?

917
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,270
Tell me you're joking.

918
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,290
Sulley, I'd like to think
that, given the circumstances

919
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,120
I have been extremely
forgiving up to now

920
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,470
but that is a horrible idea!

921
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,770
What are we going to do?

922
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,680
March right out into
public with that thing?

923
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,290
Then I guess we just waltz
right up to the factory, right?

924
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,530
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

925
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,680
Sulley, a mop, a couple of
lights and some chair fabric

926
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,440
are not going
to fool anyone!

927
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,750
Just think about
a few names, will you?

928
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,090
Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman--

929
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,680
they all got one thing
in common, pal-- banishment.

930
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,160
We could be next!

931
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,430
Don't panic--
we can do this.

932
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,570
Hey, how you doing, Frank?

933
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,680
Hey, guys.

934
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,780
Everything's going

935
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,100
to be okay.

936
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,150
( gasping )

937
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,110
( equipment buzzing loudly )

938
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,690
Number One wants this place
dusted for prints.

939
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,040
Careful with that.

940
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,510
I got a good view from here.

941
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,230
A little lower.

942
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,830
This was recovered
at the scene.

943
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,900
Don't panic.
Don't panic!

944
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,000
Don't tell me
not to panic.

945
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,970
Just keep it together.

946
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,000
Everything is not okay!

947
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,070
LITTLE GIRL:
Boo.

948
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,580
...could be contaminated.

949
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,800
Gentlemen, safety

950
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,060
is our number one concern.

951
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,400
If there's anything that...

952
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,510
not now, not now.

953
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,090
Oh, hello, little one.

954
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,880
Where did you come from?

955
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,980
Mr. Waternoose!

956
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,720
Ah, James!
ls this one yours?

957
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,410
Actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's daughter, sir.

958
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,360
Yeah, it's, uh...

959
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,150
''Bring an Obscure
Relative to Work Day.''

960
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,770
Hmm, must have missed the memo.

961
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,020
Well, listen, James

962
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,500
why don't you stop by
the simulator after lunch today

963
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,340
and give us
that scare demonstration

964
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,590
we talked about, huh?

965
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,150
Oh, oh, sir, uh....

966
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,560
Excuse me,
Mr. Waternoose?

967
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,860
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

968
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,220
All right then, I'II see
you this afternoon, James.

969
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,490
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

970
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,680
Oh, boy.

971
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,680
Oh, a scare demo.

972
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,780
Well, that is great.

973
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,910
Why am I
the last to know?

974
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,130
We can bring your cousin's
sister's daughter along.

975
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,290
She'II be a big hit!

976
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,420
( equipment buzzing loudly )

977
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,580
Halt!

978
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,620
( yelling )

979
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,720
Stop him!

980
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,460
Hold him down.

981
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,360
Come on,
the coast is clear.

982
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,970
Okay, all we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

983
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,160
So, wait here while
I get its card key.

984
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,490
But she can't stay here.

985
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,760
This is the men's room.

986
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,470
That is the weirdest thing
you have ever said.

987
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,900
It's fine. It's okay.

988
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,140
Look, it loves it here!

989
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,270
It's dancing with joy!

990
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,600
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

991
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,710
I'II be right back
with its door key.

992
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,040
( laughs )

993
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,620
That's a cute little
dance you've got.

994
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,360
It almost looks
like you've got to...

995
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,070
( whining )

996
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,050
Oh.

997
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,080
( singing in baby talk )

998
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,800
( singing stops )

999
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,560
Uh, are you
done in there?

1000
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,000
( squeals )

1001
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,480
Ah! Sorry. Sorry.

1002
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,240
( singing )

1003
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,250
( toilet flushes )

1004
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,510
Okay, you
finished now, right?

1005
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,890
Hello?

1006
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,300
( yells )

1007
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,820
Boo.

1008
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,220
( giggles )

1009
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,520
( sighs )

1010
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,180
( giggling )

1011
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,240
( chuckles )

1012
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,070
Where did she go?

1013
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,500
Oh, did she disappear?

1014
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,060
Did she turn invisible?

1015
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,860
( giggling softly )

1016
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,440
I just have no idea.

1017
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,370
Gotcha!

1018
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,090
Boo.

1019
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,490
( giggles )

1020
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,300
Hey, you're good.

1021
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,250
( sighs )

1022
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,510
Be relaxed,
be relaxed, be relaxed.

1023
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,190
Roz, my tender,
oozing blossom

1024
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,790
you're looking
fabulous today.

1025
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,070
Is that a new haircut?

1026
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,210
Come on, tell me.

1027
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,540
It's a new haircut,
isn't it?

1028
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,650
That's got to be
a new haircut.

1029
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,690
New makeup?
You've had a lift.

1030
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,110
You've had a tuck.
You've had something.

1031
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,020
Something has been
inserted in your skin

1032
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,320
that makes you look like...

1033
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,030
( sighs )

1034
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,350
Listen, I need a favor.

1035
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,360
Randall was working
late last night

1036
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,750
out on the scare floor.

1037
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,500
I really need the key
for the door he was using.

1038
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,240
Well, isn't that nice?

1039
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,590
But guess what?

1040
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,980
You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

1041
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,010
He didn't... I...
no paperwork?

1042
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,070
This office is now closed.

1043
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,790
( Mike screams in pain )

1044
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,280
Ready or not, here I come!

1045
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,220
I'm getting warmer.

1046
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,480
Any second now.

1047
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,640
Fee fi fo...

1048
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,890
What are you doing?!

1049
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,700
I-I'm looking
for the kid.

1050
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,890
You lost it?!

1051
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,220
No, no, she was just....

1052
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,010
( squeals )

1053
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,300
Here she is.

1054
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,340
( whining )

1055
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,730
Hey, what's the matter?

1056
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,500
RANDALL:
I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.

1057
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,060
CDA AGENT:
All right, carry on.

1058
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,420
( splashing )

1059
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,540
Randall!
Thank goodness!

1060
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,970
What are we going to do
about the child?

1061
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,220
Shh!

1062
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,420
Shh, shh, shh.

1063
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,400
( door slams open )

1064
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,470
( door slams open )

1065
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,440
The front page!
It's on the front page.

1066
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,350
The child--
the one you were after.

1067
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,520
Will you be quiet?!

1068
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,680
Don't you think I'm aware
of the situation?

1069
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,520
I was up all night
trying to find it.

1070
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,080
I did a simple
calculation

1071
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,570
factoring in the size
of the sushi restaurant.

1072
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,180
The child
may have escaped!

1073
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,840
Yeah, well, until
we know for sure

1074
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,080
we're going to act like nothing
happened, understand?

1075
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,910
You just get the machine
up and running.

1076
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,130
I'II take care of the kid.

1077
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,360
And when I find whoever
let it out, they're dead!

1078
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,830
Oh!

1079
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,730
Why are you still here?

1080
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,940
Come on, go!

1081
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,170
Move! Now!

1082
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,630
FUNGUS:
Ow, ow! I'm not here.

1083
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,770
SULLEY ( whispering ):
They're gone.

1084
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,400
( squeaking and splashing )

1085
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,220
LITTLE GIRL:
Eww.

1086
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,500
MIKE:
This is bad.

1087
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,000
This is so very bad.

1088
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,640
What were they talking
about a machine?

1089
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,730
Who cares? Oh!

1090
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,310
Look, don't panic--
all we have to do

1091
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,040
is call her door down
and send her home.

1092
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,450
You're right,
you're right.

1093
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,720
We're just two regular joes
on our way to work.

1094
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,120
We will blend right in.

1095
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,590
Top of the mornin', fellas!

1096
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,090
Hey, what's
shakin', bacon?

1097
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,240
Did you lose weight?

1098
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,340
Or a limb?

1099
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,630
You have
her card key, right?

1100
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,970
Of course
I have her card key.

1101
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,430
I told you
I'd get her card key.

1102
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,640
I went and got
her card key

1103
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,710
and now I have her card key.

1104
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,010
Okay, here we go.

1105
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,220
Take care of yourself.

1106
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,350
Try not to run
through any more closets.

1107
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,650
( giggles )

1108
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,200
Mike, that's
not her door.

1109
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,870
What are you
talking about?

1110
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,540
Of course it's her door.
It's her door.

1111
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,660
No, her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

1112
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,540
No. It must have been
dark last night

1113
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,860
because this is its door.

1114
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,070
( polka music playing )

1115
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,140
Hey, you hear that?

1116
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,140
Sounds like
fun in there!

1117
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,630
Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

1118
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,160
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

1119
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,460
22 Mike-Wazowski-
you-got-your-life-back lane.

1120
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,160
Mowki Kowski.

1121
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,920
Very good.
Now bon voyage!

1122
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,440
Bye-bye!
Come on.

1123
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,130
Look at the stick.
See the stick?

1124
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,410
Go get the stick!
Go fetch.

1125
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,420
Mike, this isn't
Boo's door.

1126
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,820
Boo? What's Boo?

1127
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,270
That's what I decided
to call her.

1128
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,810
Is there a problem?

1129
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,640
Sulley, you're not
supposed to name it.

1130
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,010
Once you name it, you start
getting attached to it!

1131
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,140
Now put that thing

1132
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,060
back where it came from,
or so help me...

1133
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,910
Oh, hey!

1134
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,580
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play

1135
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,990
called Put That Thing
Back Where lt Came From

1136
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,410
Or So Help Me%

1137
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,490
( Mike laughing )

1138
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,590
It's a musical!

1139
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,650
* Put that thing back where
it came from or so help me *

1140
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,890
* Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom... *

1141
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,930
* So help me,
so help me. *

1142
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,290
And cut!

1143
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,430
We're still
working on it.

1144
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,460
It's a work
in progress

1145
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,110
but, hey,
we need ushers.

1146
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,270
Sulley, I've had enough.

1147
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,070
Now say good-bye to...
where'd it go?

1148
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,140
What'd you do with it?

1149
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,170
( gasps ):
Where is she?

1150
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,270
I don't believe it.

1151
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,630
She got away
from you again?!

1152
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,770
Well, that is just...

1153
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,910
Wait a minute.

1154
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,460
The sun is coming up.

1155
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,770
This is perfect!

1156
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,680
She's gone!

1157
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1158
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,120
Where are you going?

1159
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,440
Sulley, please,
don't blow this.

1160
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,420
Not when we're so close
to breaking the record.

1161
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,810
Somebody else
will find the kid.

1162
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,210
It'II be their problem,
not ours!

1163
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,160
She's out of our hair!

1164
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,680
What are you
two doing?

1165
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,820
They're rehearsing a play.

1166
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,510
* She's out of our hair! *

1167
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,660
Can it, Wazowski!

1168
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,650
So, what do you think of that
kid getting out, Sullivan?

1169
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,960
Pretty crazy, huh?

1170
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,870
Oh, yeah, crazy.

1171
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,070
Word on the street is the kid's

1172
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,240
been traced back
to this factory.

1173
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,530
You haven't seen anything,
have you?

1174
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,090
Uh, well, uh...

1175
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,310
No, no way!

1176
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,630
But if it was
an inside job

1177
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,580
I'd put my money
on Waxford.

1178
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,810
Waxford?

1179
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,140
Yeah, the one
at station six.

1180
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,730
You know, he's got
them shifty eyes.

1181
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,990
Hey, Waxford!

1182
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,250
Sulley!

1183
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,840
CELIA:
Michael Wazowski!

1184
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,790
( whimpers )

1185
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,020
last night was one
of the worst nights

1186
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,680
of my entire life,
bar none!

1187
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,220
( hissing )

1188
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,430
I thought
you cared about me.

1189
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,510
Honey, please.

1190
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,850
Schmoopsie, I thought
you liked sushi.

1191
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,450
CELIA:
Sushi? Sushi?!!

1192
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,080
You think this is
about sushi?!

1193
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,980
Wazowski!

1194
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,630
Michael! Mike...

1195
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,050
Men.

1196
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,200
( panting )

1197
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,610
Breathe. Keep breathing.

1198
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,850
Whew.

1199
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,030
Yikes!

1200
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,870
Where's the kid?

1201
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,620
Kid? What kid?

1202
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,160
lt's here in
the factory, isn't it?

1203
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,470
You're not
pinning this on me.

1204
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,770
It never would
have gotten out

1205
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,520
if you hadn't been
cheating last night!

1206
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,620
Cheating?

1207
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,660
Cheating. Right.

1208
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,540
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.

1209
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,640
What happens when the whistle
blows in five minutes?

1210
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,300
Uh... I get a time-out?

1211
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,100
Everyone goes to lunch!

1212
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,450
Which means the scare floor
will be...?

1213
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,000
Painted?

1214
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,000
Empty! It'II be
empty, you idiot!

1215
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,850
You see that clock?

1216
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,130
When the big hand
is pointing up

1217
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,410
and the little hand
is pointing up

1218
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,900
the kid's door
will be in my station.

1219
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,270
But when the big hand
points down

1220
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,890
the door will be gone.

1221
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,040
You have until then
to put the kid back.

1222
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,830
Get the picture?

1223
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,440
( roaring playfully )

1224
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:55,910
Boo!

1225
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,490
( giggles )

1226
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:58,520
No.

1227
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,680
Hey, you! Halt!

1228
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,330
He's the one.

1229
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,770
The one from
the commercial!

1230
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:03,950
Affirmative.
That's him.

1231
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,280
Can we get
an autograph?

1232
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,870
Oh, oh, sure.
No problem.

1233
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,070
You can make that out
to Bethany, my daughter.

1234
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,420
Yes. Let's see...

1235
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,290
''From your scary friend

1236
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,010
best wishes...''

1237
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,030
So I said,
''If you talk to me

1238
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,350
like that again,
we're through!''

1239
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,470
What'd she say?

1240
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,700
You know my mom.

1241
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,440
She sent me to my room.

1242
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,280
See you guys later,
take it easy.

1243
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,470
Bottoms up!

1244
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,490
( gasps in horror )

1245
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,590
No!

1246
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,160
( singing )

1247
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,270
Whoa!

1248
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,530
Hey.

1249
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,660
( growling )

1250
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,350
Oh, well, hello, there.

1251
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,570
What's your name?

1252
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,440
Mike Wazowski!

1253
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,380
( machinery pounding loudly )

1254
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,690
( grinding and chopping )

1255
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,150
( panting )

1256
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,770
( moans )

1257
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,990
Sulley!

1258
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,760
Oh, Sulley.

1259
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,240
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.

1260
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,350
Hey, you guys seen
Sulley anywhere?

1261
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,620
Nope. Sorry.

1262
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,890
Oh, Sulley!

1263
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,440
Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.

1264
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,990
( squeaking and quacking )

1265
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,360
2319!

1266
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,050
We have a 2319!

1267
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,270
Oh, dear.

1268
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,540
Get him!

1269
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,980
Sulley? Sulley!

1270
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,960
( moaning )

1271
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,080
Sulley!

1272
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,250
Oh, great news, pal.

1273
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,670
I got us a way out of this mess

1274
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,880
but we got to hurry.

1275
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,020
Where is it?

1276
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,210
( whimpering )

1277
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,160
Sull, that's
a cube of garbage.

1278
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,580
( squeaks )

1279
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,790
Uh-oh.

1280
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,720
I-I can still hear
her little voice.

1281
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,380
BOO:
Mike Wazowski!

1282
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,760
Hey, I can hear her, too.

1283
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,380
BABY MONSTERS:
Mike Wazowski!

1284
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,110
How many kids
you got in there?

1285
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,040
Mike Wazowski!

1286
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,340
Kitty!

1287
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,020
Boo!

1288
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,500
Boo, oh,
you're all right!

1289
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,540
I was so worried!

1290
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:39,950
Don't you ever run away from me
again, young lady!

1291
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,820
Oh, but I'm so glad
you're safe.

1292
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,040
My, what an affectionate father.

1293
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,160
Actually, she's
my cousin's sister's...

1294
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,200
Okay, Sulley.

1295
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,270
That's enough.
Let's go.

1296
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,270
Mike Wazowski!

1297
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,340
Yeah, yeah.

1298
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,790
Step aside, kid.
We're in a...

1299
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,740
( screams in pain )

1300
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:55,650
( screams with laughter )

1301
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,450
( electrical buzzing )

1302
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,510
( light bulbs shattering )

1303
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,740
( gasping )

1304
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,120
( baby monsters screaming
and crying )

1305
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,720
Will you stop
making Boo laugh?

1306
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,490
I didn't, so come on!

1307
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,030
( screaming and crying
continue )

1308
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,220
I still don't understand.

1309
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,220
You've got Boo's door?

1310
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,230
I'II explain later.

1311
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,230
Run.

1312
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,640
Okay, let's move,
let's move, let's move.

1313
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:14,760
Come on.

1314
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:16,690
Oh, please be there, please
be there, please be there.

1315
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,340
There it is!

1316
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:19,370
Just like Randall said!

1317
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,470
Randall?
What a minute.

1318
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:21,470
( cries out in fear )

1319
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,470
Oh, hey.

1320
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,410
One, two, three, four!

1321
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,410
Get the kid back
through the door!

1322
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:25,410
Hey, hey.

1323
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,630
We're going to get
our lives back.

1324
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,640
The nightmare is over.

1325
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,640
Hey, it's okay, Boo.

1326
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,520
What's the matter?

1327
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:30,800
Come on, it's time to move!

1328
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:31,850
Mike, what are you thinking?

1329
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,850
We can't trust Randall.

1330
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,850
He's after Boo.

1331
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,850
Who cares?
Let's go.

1332
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,950
This is a limited time offer.

1333
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,950
No, no.

1334
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:37,960
I don't like this.

1335
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,430
Look, Sulley, you wanted
her door and there it is.

1336
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,490
Now, let's move.

1337
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,160
No, Mike.

1338
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,380
( sighs ):
You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up?

1339
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,070
Fine! He wants the door,
I get the door...

1340
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,940
( whispering ):
Mike, wait!

1341
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,610
He's a paranoid delusional
furball.

1342
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,180
Mike!

1343
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,290
( whimpers in fear )

1344
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,130
( whining )

1345
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,820
Shh, shh, shh.

1346
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:23,570
( small cry of surprise )

1347
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,580
( lunch bell rings )

1348
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:55,600
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?

1349
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,250
Sulley? Sulley?

1350
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,660
Huh?

1351
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,140
( whispering ):
Mike?

1352
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,160
Mike?

1353
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,950
Where are you?

1354
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,830
You in there?

1355
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,790
Where are you, buddy?

1356
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:22,900
Mike?

1357
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,320
Hey.

1358
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,190
( door thunks )

1359
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,130
( excited baby talk )

1360
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,720
Boo, way to go.

1361
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,780
( giggles )

1362
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,980
It's okay.

1363
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,070
( door clunks shut )

1364
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:06,160
( pipes whistling and venting )

1365
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,850
( distant voices )

1366
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,110
RANDALL:
Yes! I got the kid!

1367
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,640
FUNGUS:
Oh, huzzah!

1368
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,660
That's great news.

1369
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,530
Not that I was concerned,
of course.

1370
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,210
Just get over
here and help me!

1371
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,140
Come on, come
on, come on.

1372
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,200
While we're young
here, Fungus!

1373
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,850
( both straining )

1374
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,710
Kid needs to take
off a few pounds.

1375
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,780
( yelps )

1376
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,780
Wazowski?!

1377
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,200
Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

1378
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,480
Okay, first of all,
it's cree-tin.

1379
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,480
If you're going
to threaten me

1380
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,580
do it properly.

1381
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,710
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me

1382
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,590
is going to help you cheat
your way to the top!

1383
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,040
( chuckling evilly )

1384
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:53,330
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

1385
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,770
Well... I did, right up
until you chuckled like that

1386
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,140
and now I'm thinking
I should just get out of here.

1387
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,580
I am about to revolutionize
the scaring industry

1388
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,080
and when I do, even
the great James P. Sullivan

1389
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,760
is going to be
working for me.

1390
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,910
MIKE:
Well

1391
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,230
somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

1392
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,960
First, I need to know
where the kid is

1393
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,310
and you're going
to tell me.

1394
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,580
Yeah, I don't
know anything.

1395
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,590
Uh-huh, sure.

1396
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:18,600
MIKE:
I don't.

1397
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,790
I mean, I don't.

1398
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,210
Oh-oh.

1399
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,650
( mechanical clanging
and grinding )

1400
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:23,730
What's that?

1401
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,080
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1402
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,490
Oh-oh. Oh-oh.
Oh, come on.

1403
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,500
No, no, no, no, no.

1404
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,700
Come on,
hey, hey, hey.

1405
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,470
This thing is moving.

1406
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,560
I don't like big...

1407
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,860
moving things that are
moving towards me.

1408
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,390
No! Come on!

1409
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,890
Hey, Randall!

1410
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,160
Say hello
to the scream extractor.

1411
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,210
Hello.

1412
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,540
Come on,
where you going?

1413
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,550
We'II talk.

1414
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,780
Come on,
we'II have a latte!

1415
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,820
Come on.

1416
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,590
We can talk
about this.

1417
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,450
( electrical whirring starts,
then grows louder )

1418
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,290
What's that thing?
What is that thing?

1419
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,590
Wait, wait, wait!

1420
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,760
Stop, stop!

1421
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,150
No, no!

1422
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,200
Come on, hey!

1423
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,690
( deep, resonating whirring )

1424
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,480
Help! Help! Help!

1425
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:04,510
Help!

1426
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,500
( yelling )

1427
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,990
( noise dies away )

1428
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,110
Oh, for...

1429
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,540
What did you
do wrong this time?

1430
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,650
I don't know.

1431
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,880
I calibrated the drive...

1432
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,370
Go check the machine!

1433
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,480
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

1434
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,160
That's the problem
with these 3250 units...

1435
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,250
Huh?

1436
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,160
Hmm.

1437
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,640
Psst!

1438
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,260
Fungus.
Fungus.

1439
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,430
You like cars, huh?

1440
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,970
'Cause I got a really nice car.

1441
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,400
If you let me go,
I'II give you...

1442
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,780
a ride in the car.

1443
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,240
Please, Fungus?

1444
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,060
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said

1445
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,860
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.

1446
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,960
( gasps )

1447
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,450
( clanging )

1448
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,820
Hmm...

1449
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,800
( zapping )

1450
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,960
( electrical whirring )

1451
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,150
( clanking, rattling, whirring )

1452
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,240
( gasps )

1453
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,240
( muff
ed screams )

1454
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,020
What happened?

1455
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,780
Where's Wazowski?

1456
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,520
( muff
ed screams )

1457
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,410
( shuts off machine )

1458
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,810
Where is he?!

1459
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,520
( whimpering )

1460
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,680
( growls )

1461
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,950
( whimpering )

1462
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,190
( squeals )

1463
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,480
Come on!

1464
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,070
This is crazy.
He's going to kill us!

1465
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,280
CDA AGENT 1 :
Careful.
That could be contaminated.

1466
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,880
We got to get out of here now!

1467
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,440
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.

1468
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,820
Good-bye, Monsters, Inc.!

1469
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,700
Good-bye, Mr. Waternoose!

1470
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,190
No, Mike, wait!

1471
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,620
Hey, what are you doing?

1472
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,190
Follow me. I have an idea.

1473
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,910
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

1474
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,140
COMPUTER VOICE ( over PA ):
Simulation terminated.

1475
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,470
WATERNOOSE:
No, no, no, no, no.

1476
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,610
What was that?

1477
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,410
You're trying to scare the kid,
not lull it to sleep.

1478
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,440
I was going for a
snake
ninja approach

1479
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,850
with a little hissing.

1480
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:54,860
( hisses )

1481
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,330
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1482
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,070
It's all about presence!

1483
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,130
About how you enter the room!

1484
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,620
Mr. Waternoose!

1485
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,600
James! Perfect timing.

1486
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,190
No, no. Sir, you
don't understand.

1487
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,170
Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.

1488
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,210
What? No, no,
I can't...

1489
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,280
Sir...
sir, you have

1490
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,250
to listen to me.

1491
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,310
Pay attention, everyone.

1492
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,320
You're about to see

1493
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,800
the best in
the business.

1494
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:15,820
Reset the simulator.

1495
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:16,820
But-but, sir!

1496
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,200
MOTHER:
Good night, sweetheart.

1497
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,610
ANIMATRONIC BOY:
Night, Mom.

1498
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,620
Kitty!

1499
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,750
No, Boo, no, no!

1500
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,460
Now, give us a big, loud roar.

1501
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,330
Mr. Waternoose,
there's no time for this.

1502
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:27,100
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Roar!

1503
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,070
But-but-but, sir!

1504
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,940
Roar!

1505
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,280
( groans )

1506
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,620
( roaring ferociously )

1507
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,180
( shrieking in terror )

1508
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,780
( gasps )

1509
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,970
( roaring ferociously )

1510
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,130
( squeals )

1511
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,420
( Boo crying )

1512
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,540
( students applauding )

1513
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,580
WATERNOOSE:
Well done.

1514
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,350
Well done, James.

1515
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,860
Boo?

1516
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,550
--All right, gentlemen,
I hope you've learned...
--Right this way, everyone.

1517
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,260
...a valuable lesson
in scaring today.

1518
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,770
( fearful whimper )

1519
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,110
( whines softly )

1520
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,540
Boo.

1521
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,140
( nervous grunt )

1522
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,060
( whining )

1523
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,390
Boo?

1524
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,650
( panicked grunts )

1525
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:03,930
( door slams )

1526
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,730
Boo, it's me.

1527
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:07,970
( squealing )

1528
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,520
( gasps ):
The child!

1529
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,610
Sir, she isn't toxic.

1530
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,510
I know it sounds
crazy, but trust me.

1531
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,550
Boo?

1532
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,680
No, no, no, no.

1533
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:16,690
It's okay.

1534
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,810
I was just...

1535
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,080
( whimpering in fear )

1536
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,050
No, no, no, no, no,
don't be scared.

1537
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,860
That wasn't real.

1538
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,050
It's just a...

1539
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,260
I was just...

1540
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,550
( crying ):
No...

1541
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,920
( Boo continues crying )

1542
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,590
( Boo sobbing )

1543
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,960
Boo.

1544
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,520
MIKE:
...and he was going
to test it out

1545
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,540
on that sweet,
little girl.

1546
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:44,380
--Boo.
--Now that we have her...

1547
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:45,670
...he is trying
to kill us.

1548
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,510
This whole thing
is Randall's fault.

1549
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:48,810
Randall?

1550
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,320
Yes. And we can take you to his
secret lab, which is right here

1551
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,390
in this factory.

1552
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:53,680
How could this happen?

1553
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,650
Oh, how could this happen?

1554
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,840
Does anyone else
know about this?

1555
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:58,890
No, sir.

1556
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,470
Good.

1557
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,390
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

1558
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,640
Now, before we do
anything else, let's...

1559
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,020
take care of the child.

1560
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,880
Oh, I never thought things
would come to this...

1561
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,930
not in my factory.

1562
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,260
I'm sorry you boys
got mixed up in this.

1563
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,840
Especially you, James.

1564
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,630
But now we can set

1565
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,150
everything straight again
for the good of the company.

1566
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,420
( whirring )

1567
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:32,880
( thunk )

1568
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,060
MIKE:
Uh...

1569
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,310
sir, that's not her door.

1570
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,010
I know, I know.

1571
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:41,970
It's yours.

1572
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,170
( startled gasps )

1573
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,340
( grunts )

1574
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,530
( yelling )

1575
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,420
No!

1576
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,930
( gasps )

1577
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:54,020
( voice echoing ):
Boo!

1578
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,290
( gasps )

1579
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,330
No! No!

1580
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,380
No! No! No! No!

1581
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,490
No!

1582
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:03,820
( desperate grunts )

1583
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,900
lt's too late!

1584
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,540
We're banished, genius.

1585
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,430
We're in the human world!

1586
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,840
Oh, what a great idea, going
to your old pal Waternoose!

1587
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,130
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!

1588
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,800
All you had to do was listen
to me-- just once!

1589
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,130
But you didn't, did you?

1590
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,660
You're still not listening!

1591
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,510
( yelling )

1592
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,730
( Sulley grunting and groaning )

1593
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,990
Take that!

1594
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,700
( growling )

1595
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,440
( gasps in horror )

1596
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,480
Welcome to the Himalayas!

1597
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,910
( wind gusting )

1598
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,650
''Abominable''!

1599
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:44,680
( chuckles )

1600
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,970
Can you believe that?

1601
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,780
Do I look abominable to you?

1602
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,730
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman or...

1603
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,580
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

1604
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,980
I'm a nice guy.

1605
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,340
Snow cone?

1606
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,360
Yuck.

1607
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,360
No, no, no.

1608
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,970
Don't worry--
it's lemon.

1609
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,180
Uh, how about
you, big fella?

1610
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,380
Snow cone?

1611
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:09,050
Did you see the way she...
looked at me?

1612
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,720
( sighs )

1613
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,600
Ah, poor guy.

1614
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:13,770
I understand.

1615
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,450
lt ain't easy
being banished.

1616
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,900
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

1617
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,140
When he was banished

1618
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,130
he fashioned an enormous diaper
out of poison ivy.

1619
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,150
Wore it on his head
like a tiara.

1620
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,790
Called himself King Itchy.

1621
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,580
Ah, it won't be so hard for
you guys, though, you know.

1622
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,170
I mean, how lucky
can you get?

1623
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,740
Banished with your
best friend.

1624
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,240
He is not my friend.

1625
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,220
Oh. I just assumed you
were buddies, you know

1626
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,840
when I saw you out
there in the snow

1627
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:36,870
hugging and all that.

1628
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:37,990
Look at that big jerk.

1629
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,480
Ruined my life, and for what?

1630
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,660
A stupid kid!

1631
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,630
Because of you,
I am now stuck

1632
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,250
in this frozen
wasteland!

1633
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,310
Wasteland?

1634
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,720
I think you mean wonderland!

1635
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,250
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

1636
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,880
Oh, and wait till you see
the local village.

1637
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,560
Cutest thing in the world.

1638
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,870
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

1639
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,560
What... what did you say?

1640
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:59,590
Yak's milk.

1641
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,360
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic.

1642
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,160
You know, once you pick
the hairs out

1643
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,230
it's very nutritious.

1644
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,680
No, no. Something
about a village.

1645
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,020
Where?
Are there kids in it?

1646
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,190
Kids? Sure.

1647
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,350
Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks...

1648
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,400
Where is it?!

1649
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,850
It's at the bottom
of the mountain.

1650
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,060
Around a three-day hike.

1651
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,420
Oh, three days?!

1652
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,860
We need to get there now!

1653
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:17,910
( thump )

1654
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,910
( ding )

1655
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,720
You want to go to the village?

1656
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:32,130
Okay, rule number one
out here.

1657
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,320
Always...

1658
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,460
No.

1659
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,740
Never go out in a blizzard.

1660
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,470
We need to get to Boo.

1661
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,950
( grunts, then gasps )

1662
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,830
Boo?!

1663
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,280
What about us?

1664
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,310
( grunts )

1665
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,010
Ever since that kid
came in

1666
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,520
you've ignored
everything I've said

1667
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,730
and now look where we are!

1668
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,380
Oh, we were about
to break the record, Sulley.

1669
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,930
We would have had it made!

1670
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,240
None of that matters now.

1671
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:57,790
None of it matter...

1672
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,110
Wa-wait a second.

1673
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,340
None of it matters?

1674
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,970
( sighs )

1675
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,510
MIKE:
Okay.

1676
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,550
That's.... no. Good. Great.

1677
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,260
So, now the truth comes out,
doesn't it?

1678
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:12,540
Oh, would you
look at that?

1679
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,470
We're out of
snow cones, uh...

1680
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:16,210
Let me... just go outside

1681
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,560
and make some more.

1682
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:21,870
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

1683
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,260
Does that matter?
Huh?

1684
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,310
And what about Celia?

1685
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,140
I am never... never
going to see her again.

1686
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,800
Doesn't that matter?

1687
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,190
( sighs )

1688
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:39,850
What about me?

1689
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:41,510
I'm your pal.

1690
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,620
I'm... I'm your best friend.

1691
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,790
Don't I matter?

1692
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,220
( sighs )

1693
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,400
I'm sorry, Mike.

1694
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,330
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

1695
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,570
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

1696
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,320
But Boo's in trouble.

1697
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,250
I think there might
be a way to save her

1698
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,900
if we can just
get down to that...

1699
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,920
''We''?

1700
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?

1701
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,150
No.

1702
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,250
There's no ''we'' this time, pal.

1703
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:09,540
I-if-if you want
to go out there

1704
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,950
and freeze to death

1705
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,380
you be my guest...

1706
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,320
because you're on your own.

1707
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,650
* *

1708
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:43,060
( wind whistles )

1709
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,850
Hey, I got more snow cones!

1710
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,220
Ohh!

1711
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:08,090
Ahh!

1712
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:15,660
Ahh!

1713
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,640
( yells )

1714
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,720
( grunting and groaning )

1715
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:26,330
( wind howling )

1716
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:32,150
( distant child screaming )

1717
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,380
( children screaming )

1718
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,380
Oh, come on, now, George.

1719
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,980
I know you can do this.

1720
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,240
I picked out an easy door
for you-- in Nepal.

1721
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,400
Nice, quiet Nepal.

1722
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,180
You know, you're right.

1723
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,430
Here, take this.

1724
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,150
Go get 'em, Georgie!

1725
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,950
Gangway! Look out!
Coming through!

1726
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,300
Sorry, George.

1727
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,700
Hey, you can't just...

1728
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,720
( gasps )

1729
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,720
23...

1730
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,390
( gagging )

1731
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,750
( whistling )

1732
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:10,020
Out of the way!

1733
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,030
--Hey!
--Whoa!

1734
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,570
Don't!

1735
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,240
( gasps )

1736
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,460
( whimpers )

1737
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,720
Finally!

1738
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,920
I never should have
trusted you with this.

1739
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,480
Because of you, I had
to banish my top scarer!

1740
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,880
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

1741
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,190
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.

1742
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,260
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be!

1743
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:30,350
( low growl )

1744
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,580
( panting )

1745
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:32,580
( clanging )

1746
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:33,880
( grunting )

1747
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,270
( yells with effort )

1748
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,360
( mechanical whirring )

1749
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:42,070
( gasps )

1750
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:44,450
Kitty!

1751
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:45,600
( whirring and hissing )

1752
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:47,340
( yelling )

1753
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,720
( shrieking )

1754
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:49,900
( roaring )

1755
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,610
Kitty!

1756
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,350
Sullivan?

1757
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,630
( grunting )

1758
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,500
Wh-whoa!

1759
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:00,840
Kitty!

1760
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:01,980
Sorry, Boo.

1761
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,430
Stop him!

1762
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:04,640
( growls )

1763
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:07,130
Let's get you home.

1764
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:07,840
( panting )

1765
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,820
( blow lands )

1766
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:09,860
Ooh!

1767
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:11,240
WATERNOOSE:
Finish him off!

1768
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:12,290
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

1769
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,260
( clanging )

1770
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:16,630
( thunk )

1771
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,750
You don't know how long

1772
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,660
I've wanted to do
that, Sullivan.

1773
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:23,740
( grunts )

1774
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:24,770
( chuckles )

1775
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:27,480
( punches landing )

1776
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,510
Hah!

1777
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:29,450
Ooh!

1778
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,800
( shrieks )

1779
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:33,670
( panting )

1780
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,680
Ooh!

1781
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,880
Mike?!

1782
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:37,720
Look, it's not that I
don't care about the kid.

1783
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,050
Mike, you don't
understand.

1784
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,860
Yes, I do. I was
just mad, that's all.

1785
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:42,310
I needed some time to think.

1786
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,350
But you shouldn't
have left me out there.

1787
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:45,430
( thump )

1788
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:46,850
I'm being attacked!

1789
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,220
No, I'm not attacking you.

1790
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,460
I'm trying to be honest.

1791
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:50,470
Just hear me out.

1792
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:51,690
You and I are a team.

1793
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,400
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

1794
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:55,470
I-I-I know, kid.

1795
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,600
He's too sensitive.

1796
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,320
( gagging )

1797
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,150
( whining cry )

1798
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,500
Come on, pal.

1799
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,190
If you start crying,
I'm going to cry

1800
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,730
and I'II never get through this.

1801
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,320
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you

1802
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,390
but I am now.

1803
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,230
Ow!

1804
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,670
Sulley, I am baring
my soul here.

1805
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,780
The least you could do
is pay attention!

1806
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:14,500
( yells in pain )

1807
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,560
( sighs in relief )

1808
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,810
Hey, look at that--
it's Randall! It's...

1809
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:19,870
Oh.

1810
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,120
Come on!

1811
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,490
WATERNOOSE:
Get up!

1812
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,440
There can't be
any witnesses.

1813
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:25,760
There won't be.

1814
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,300
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

1815
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,850
Somebody's got take care
of you, you big hairball.

1816
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:30,980
( Celia screaming )

1817
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,620
( screaming )

1818
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:33,650
Ow!

1819
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,680
Schmoopsie-poo,
I really can't talk.

1820
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,780
Come on!

1821
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,360
Michael, if you
don't tell me

1822
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,540
what's going on right
now, we are through!

1823
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,820
You hear me? Through!

1824
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:42,990
Here's the truth.

1825
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,800
You know the kid that they're
looking for-- Sulley let her in.

1826
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:45,860
We tried to
send her back

1827
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,250
but Waternoose
had this secret plot

1828
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,640
and now Randall's right behind
us and he's trying to kill us!

1829
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:52,940
You expect me to believe that
pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!

1830
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,450
Mike Wazowski!

1831
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,730
( startled yell )

1832
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,160
I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!

1833
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,980
RANDALL:
Move it! Look out, you...

1834
01:06:59,120 --> 01:06:59,820
Oh!

1835
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:00,820
...idiot!

1836
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:01,980
( huff'
ng )

1837
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,970
Look out. Coming through,
here, coming through!

1838
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,340
Make way. Move it!

1839
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,640
Hurry up, hurry up.

1840
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,580
There they are!

1841
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,480
Celia: ( over PA )
Attention, employees:
Randall Boggs

1842
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:14,410
has just broken
the all-time scare record.

1843
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,500
Huh?

1844
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,500
No, I didn't.

1845
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,660
Get out of my way!

1846
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,660
( clamoring )

1847
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,240
Go get 'em, Googley Bear!

1848
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,430
( Boo shrieks )

1849
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,590
There it is!

1850
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,180
RANDALL:
Get off my tail!

1851
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,370
Let me through!

1852
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:30,440
Sulley,
what are you doing?

1853
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,450
Grab on, Mike!

1854
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,570
Are you out of your...?

1855
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,900
( screaming )

1856
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,430
( whirring )

1857
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,000
( Mike whimpering )

1858
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,510
MIKE:
Sulley, what are we doing?

1859
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,770
We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.

1860
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:50,550
MIKE:
What a plan--
simple, yet insane!

1861
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,790
( growls )

1862
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,220
Whoa.

1863
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,760
--( gasps )
--Oh, boy.

1864
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,650
Hold on!

1865
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,740
( Mike screaming )

1866
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:13,050
( screaming )

1867
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,830
( clinking )

1868
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:15,800
Wow!

1869
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:16,790
Don't look down!

1870
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,690
( teeth chattering )

1871
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,660
( rattling )

1872
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:22,700
( startled gasp )

1873
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:28,150
( screaming )

1874
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,840
( shrieking )

1875
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,710
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick!

1876
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,740
Whoa!

1877
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,290
( screaming )

1878
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,480
Oh, no!

1879
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,310
( chugging and clanking )

1880
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,710
No!

1881
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,980
Aah...

1882
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,770
Boo's door?

1883
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:48,630
There it is!

1884
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,970
MIKE:
How are we supposed
to get to it now?

1885
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,750
Oh, it's a dead
end, Sulley!

1886
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,900
( gasps )

1887
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,200
MIKE:
There he is.

1888
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:00,270
Make her laugh.

1889
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,050
What, Sulley?!

1890
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,690
Just do it!

1891
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,510
Oh... ow!

1892
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,610
( laughing )

1893
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:06,220
( squealing laughter )

1894
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:09,840
( engines starting )

1895
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:12,170
SULLIVAN:
Get it open.

1896
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:13,900
Here he comes.

1897
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,040
Give me that kid!

1898
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:18,600
( birds twittering )

1899
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:19,980
( Boo giggling )

1900
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:22,090
Why couldn't we
get banished here?

1901
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,350
Come on. We got to
find another door.

1902
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:26,440
( gasps )

1903
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,700
Look, Boo's door!

1904
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:35,110
( grunting )

1905
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:36,950
There he is!

1906
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:38,240
Hurry up, hurry up!

1907
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,830
Give me your hand.

1908
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,800

1909
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,960
( grunts )

1910
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:47,070
Come on, it slides,

1911
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,190
Ooh, right, right, right.

1912

1914
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,850
Jump!
I'm behind you!

1915
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,800
Come on!

1916
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,990
Hurry up! Keep moving!

1917
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:05,330
Get inside!

1918
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,310
Ooh! That was weird.

1919

( grunts )

1920
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,740
Mike?

1921
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:11,270
Oh, sorry, buddy.

1922
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,540
( stunned mumbling )

1923
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,440
( growls )

1924
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:18,780
( electronic whirring )

1925
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:19,790
Oh!

1926
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,950
I hope that hurt, lizard boy!

1927
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,670
( laughing )

1928
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:28,780
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.

1929
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,810
( squeals )

1930
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,810
Boo!

1931
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,810
Ha, ha!

1932
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,810
No!

1933
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,120
( screaming )

1934
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,880
Nice working with you!

1935
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:37,920
Get it open!

1936
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:39,650
--I'm trying!
--Open the door!

1937
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,260
Come on, get in here!

1938

1942
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:56,530
There they are!

1943
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,410
Sulley, what are you doing?

1944
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:03,860
Sulley!

1945
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:04,870

1947
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:06,880
( yells )

1948
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,640
Looks like we caught
the express, pal.

1949
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:10,850
Do you see them?

1950
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,430
Straight ahead!

1951
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,710
No...

1952
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,720
( stifled cry )

1953
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,320
( grunting nervously )

1954
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,220
Kitty!

1955
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,310
Boo!

01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:42,990
( whimpering )

1958
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:47,770
RANDALL:
Look at everybody's
favorite scarer now!

1959
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,400
You stupid, pathetic waste!

1960
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,460
( thump )

1961
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,580
You've been number one
for too long, Sullivan.

1962
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:58,790
Now your time is up!

1963
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:00,730
And don't worry.

1964
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,880
I'II take good care of the kid.

1965
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:04,940
No!

1966
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,610
( yelling )

1967
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,690
( Boo grunting
and Randall gagging )

1968
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:11,550
( Randall groaning )

1969
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:24,450
( gagging )

1970
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,330
( roaring angrily )

1971
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,550
She's not scared
of you anymore.

1972
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,180
( roars angrily )

1973
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:32,390
Looks like you're out of a job.

1974
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,700
( gulps )

1975
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:34,840
All right, come on,
over the plate.

1976
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,000
Let's see
the ol' stuff here, pal.

1977
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,720
Come on, now, chuck him,
chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.

1978
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,840
Hum, baby,
here's the pitch.

1979
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,200
Wait, please, don't,
don't, don't!

1980
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:41,050
No!

1981
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,050
And he is...
out of here!

1982
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:43,400
( crickets chirping )

1983
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,950
BOY:
Mama, another gator
got in the house.

1984
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,020
Another gator?!

1985
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,950
Give me that shovel!
Come here!

1986
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,470
( clanging, yelling )

1987
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,420
Get him, mama!
Get that gator!

1988
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:54,940
Care to do the honors,
Mikey?

1989
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,760
With pleasure.

1990
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,340
( thud )

1991
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,790
( baby talk )

1992
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,160
That's right, Boo.

1993
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,340
You did it.

1994
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,540
You beat him.

1995
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,540
( raspberry )

1996
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,990
Come on.

1997
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,340
Okay, Boo,
it's time to go home.

1998
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,630
Take care of yourself,
and be a good girl, okay?

1999
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,850
( gasps )

2000
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:21,050
Oh, no!

2001
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,020
The power's out!

2002
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,470
Make her laugh again.

2003
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:24,850
All right, I got a move here.

2004
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,210
It'II bring down the house.

2005
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,360
Up...

2006
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,530
( metallic clang )

2007
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,730
( groans softly )

2008
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,010
Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.

2009
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:33,710
What?! What'd you do,
forget to check

2010
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,060
if her stupid hood was up

2011
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:36,300
ya big dope?!

2012
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,560
( singsong ):
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

2013
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,180
You know we still need her
to laugh.

2014
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,210
Right.

2015
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,210
( laughs )

2016
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:43,920
Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!

2017
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,950
( gibberish )

2018
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,530
Funny, right? Huh?
See what the...

2019
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,650
These are the jokes, kid.

2020
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:48,850
Whoa!

2021
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,720
What's happening?

2022
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,840
SULLIVAN:
Hold on!

2023
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,140
When the door lands
in this station, cut the power.

2024
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:59,210
You'II have the child
and the criminals responsible

2025
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,710
for this whole mess.

2026
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,700
Great.
A welcoming committee!

2027
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,570
What are we going to do?!

2028
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:09,230
( electrical humming )

2029
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,220
( clang )

2030
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,380
This is the CDA.

2031
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,550
Come out slowly

2032
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:21,190
with the child
in plain sight.

2033
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,500
Okay, okay.

2034
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,590
You got us.

2035
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:25,720
Here we are.

2036
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:26,730
Here's the kid.

2037
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,270
I'm cooperating.

2038
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:30,230
But before you take us away,
I have one thing to say:

2039
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,270
( gags )

2040
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,680
Catch!

2041
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,690
( all shouting ):
2319!

2042
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,410
We have a toxic
projectile!

2043
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,080
Halt! After the suspect!

2044
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,550
Cover the area!
Bring in reinforcements!

2045
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:41,150
WATERNOOSE:
Stop him!

2046
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,740
( Boo squeaks )

2047
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,040
Come on.

2048
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,300
Don't let them get away.

2049
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,350
What...?!

2050
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,540
No, wait, wait!

2051
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,190
Come back!
He has the child!

2052
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,540
( frustrated growl )

2053
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:56,460
( Boo squeaks )

2054
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,000
Sullivan? Sullivan!

2055
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,700
Give me the child!

2056
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:01,920
Me not go!

2057
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:02,900
Give her to me!

2058
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,320
( panting )

2059
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,850
( grunts )

2060
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,540
( metallic creaking )

2061
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:16,000
WATERNOOSE:
Open this door!
Open this door!

2062
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:17,850
( growling and pounding )

2063
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:19,750
Hey!

2064
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,330
Sullivan!

2065
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,260
( yells )

2066
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,030
WATERNOOSE:
Don't do it.

2067
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,870
( beep )

2068
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,700
Come on.

2069
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,710
Don't go in that room!

2070
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:30,400
( yelling )

2071
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,780
I think we stopped him, Boo.

2072
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:33,990
You're safe now.

2073
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:37,240
You be a good girl, okay?

2074
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,880
This has gone
far enough, James.

2075
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,320
She's home now!
Just leave her alone!

2076
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:42,530
I can't do that!

2077
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,670
She's seen too much.

2078
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:45,350
You both have.

2079
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,800
It doesn't have to be this way.

2080
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,460
I have no choice!

2081
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,580
Times have changed.

2082
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,260
Scaring isn't enough anymore.

2083
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,740
But kidnapping children?!

2084
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,360
I'II kidnap
a thousand children

2085
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,900
before I let
this company die

2086
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,730
and I'II silence anyone

2087
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,630
who gets in my way!

2088
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,010
No!

2089
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:03,370
( child@s voice ):
Good night, Mom.

2090
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:05,170
( woman@s voice ):
Good night, sweetheart.

2091
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,140
Good night, Mom.

2092
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,450
What, wh-what is this?!
What? Who? Huh?

2093
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,820
COMPUTER:
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

2094
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:12,900
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys

2095
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:14,900
but I spotted
several big mistakes.

2096
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,430
But-but-but how-how did...?
How did...?

2097
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,640
MIKE:
You know what?

2098
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:20,440
Let's watch my favorite part
again... shall we?

2099
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,600
( repeating ):
I'II kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die.

2100
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,590
What...? Wha...?

2101
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,620
I'II kidnap
a thousand children before...

2102
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,110
( baby talk )

2103
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:30,610
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

2104
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,210
Shh!

2105
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,230
I'II get him.

2106
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:34,390
All right,
come with us, sir.

2107
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,490
Wh-what are
you doing?

2108
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,600
Take your
hands off me!

2109
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,700
You can't
arrest me!

2110
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:38,990
I hope you're happy, Sullivan!

2111
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:41,220
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

2112
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,870
Where will everyone
get their scream now?!

2113
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:46,260
The energy crisis
will only get worse

2114
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,920
because of you!

2115
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,300
( loud clang )

2116
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,300
Stay where you are.

2117
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:54,350
Huh?

2118
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,770
Number One
wants to talk to you.

2119
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,910
Attention!

2120
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,990
Hello, boys.

2121
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,070
BOTH:
Roz?!

2122
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,950
Two and a half years
of undercover work

2123
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,030
were almost wasted

2124
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:16,600
when you intercepted
that child, Mr. Sullivan.

2125
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:20,210
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known

2126
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:23,170
that this went all the way up
to Waternoose.

2127
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,050
( baby talk )

2128
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,700
( gasps )

2129
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,980
ROZ:
Now...

2130
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,670
about the girl...

2131
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:32,840
I just want to
send her home.

2132
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,160
Very good.

2133
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,320
( chiming tones )

2134
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,100
Bring me a door shredder.

2135
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:40,280
What, you mean... you mean,
I can't see her again?

2136
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:43,670
That's the way it has to be.

2137
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,820
I'II give you
five minutes.

2138
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:53,300
( whirring hum )

2139
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,100
Well, so long, kid.

2140
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:01,150
Mike Wazowski!

2141
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:02,670
Yeah.

2142
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:07,790
Ah, Boo,
it's been fun.

2143
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:09,350
Go ahead.

2144
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,810
Go grow up.

2145
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,870
( door creaking )

2146
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:24,860
( squealing in delight )

2147
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,110
( laughing )

2148
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:31,560
Uh-uh, B-Boo...?

2149
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:32,560
( speaking baby talk )

2150
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:33,720
Um... Boo?

2151
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,210
( speaking baby talk )

2152
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,420
Oh, look at that.

2153
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:38,680
Yeah, you know...

2154
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:40,500
Oh, that's cute, yeah.

2155
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,630
( baby talk )

2156
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,830
Uh, Boo, um...

2157
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:43,840
( squeaking toy )

2158
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,350
Well, that's very nice.

2159
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,180
( giggling )

2160
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,630
Come here, you!

2161
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,900
( squeals )

2162
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:52,000
( both laughing )

2163
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,510
* Oh, he's a happy bear... *

2164
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,230
( giggling )

2165
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,350
( baby talk )

2166
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:07,090
Nothing's coming
out of your closet

2167
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:08,680
to scare you
anymore, right?

2168
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:09,830
Mm...

2169
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:12,280
Yeah.

2170
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,750
Good-bye, Boo.

2171
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:17,500
Kitty.

2172
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,660
Kitty has to go.

2173
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,880
* *

2174
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,210
Boo!

2175
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,510
( gasps )

2176
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,610
Kitty?

2177
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:10,010
( motor buzzing loudly )

2178
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,930
( clicks off )

2179
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,350
None of this

2180
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:19,290
ever happened, gentlemen.

2181
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:23,930
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

2182
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,600
( door closes )

2183
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,920
Take him away.

2184
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,930
( all murmuring )

2185
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:51,970
I bet we get
the rest of the day off.

2186
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,200
You idiot!

2187
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:55,300
They're going to shut down
the factory!

2188
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,120
( all gasp )

2189
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:59,210
I'm telling you, pal,
when that wall went up

2190
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,730
you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.

2191
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,970
Whoo-hoo! I hope we get
a copy of that tape.

2192
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,280
Hey, you all right?

2193
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:07,410
Come on, pal,
cheer up, we did it!

2194
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,560
We got Boo home.

2195
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:10,850
Ah, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet, and...

2196
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,340
gee, hundreds of people
will be out of work now.

2197
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,750
Not to mention the angry mob
that'II come after us

2198
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:17,670
when there's no more power,
but, hey...

2199
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:20,690
at least we had
some laughs, right?

2200
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,740
Laughs...

2201
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:27,130
( crickets chirping )

2202
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:28,950
( wind blowing softly )

2203
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:31,750
( door quietly creaks open )

2204
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:42,550
( boy gasps )

2205
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:46,640
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello?

2206
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,310
Hello?
Testing, testing.

2207
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,790
Hey, good evening.
How are you?

2208
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:51,190
How are you?
Nice to see you.

2209
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:53,270
I tell you, it's good
to be here in... your room.

2210
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,500
Where you from?

2211
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:55,800
Never mind.

2212
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,810
You're in
kindergarten, right?

2213
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,010
Oh, I love kindergarten.

2214
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:00,790
Best three years of my life.

2215
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,240
Of my life.

2216
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:04,260
But I love sports.

2217
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:05,580
Dodgeball
was the best.

2218
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,590
Oh, yeah.

2219
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,040
I was the fastest one out there.

2220
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,800
Course I was the ball.

2221
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,600
But I...

2222
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,210
was the ball, see?

2223
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,880
All right.

2224
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:20,680
( rumbling )

2225
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:22,320
( rumbling gets louder )

2226
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,530
( gurgling )

2227
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,500
Ah...

2228
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,830
( huge burp )

2229
01:22:26,890 --> 01:22:28,010
Ah?

2230
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,620
( laughing )

2231
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,810
Hey, thanks a lot.

2232
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,050
I'II be here all week.

2233
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:33,790
Remember to tip your waitresses.

2234
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:35,620
( guffawing )

2235
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:37,010
( rippling gurgle )

2236
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,410
( bell dings )

2237
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:39,620
Great job, Mikey.

2238
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,810
You filled your quota on
the first kid of the day.

2239
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:43,060
Not bad, huh?

2240
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,280
You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

2241
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:47,200
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

2242
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:48,750
Uh-huh, and the fact
that laughter is

2243
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,290
ten times more
powerful than scream

2244
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,440
had nothing to do with it.

2245
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:52,670
( clears throat )

2246
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:53,960
CELIA:
Oh, Googley Bear.

2247
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,290
Come here, you.

2248
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,350
Schmoopsie-poo!

2249
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,380
Googley.

2250
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,540
Whoa!

2251
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:00,710
( snakes chittering )

2252
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:01,850
( Mike giggling )

2253
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:02,950
Girls!
Girls, put...

2254
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:05,200
Stop, stop, stop!

2255
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,600
Michael,
you're such a charmer.

2256
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:09,040
Hey, did you bring
the magazine?

2257
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,410
They just delivered
a whole box.

2258
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:11,430
Let me see it!

2259
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:12,520
( laughing )

2260
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:14,110
Sulley and I
made the cover, right?

2261
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:17,440
( whispering ):
I don't believe it.

2262
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:19,210
( sympathetically ):
Googley Bear...

2263
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:22,480
I'm on the cover
of a magazine!

2264
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:24,060
Ow!

2265
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:25,490
( chattering )

2266
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:28,650
( jittering blubbers )

2267
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,740
Oh, this is great!

2268
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:33,260
( humming happily )

2269
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:35,090
( child laughing uproariously )

2270
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,320
( bell dings )

2271
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:39,020
Oh.

2272
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:44,200
( distant laughter )

2273
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,710
( kazoo whirs )

2274
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:47,600
( toy horn toots )

2275
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,270
MIKE:
Hey, Sulley!

2276
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,730
( yells )

2277
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:00,910
Hey, uh, Mike.
I was, uh, just...

2278
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:02,080
Well, listen,
if you got a minute

2279
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,530
there's something
I want to show you.

2280
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:04,550
But-but-but...

2281
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:05,550
Okay, close
your eyes.

2282
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:06,650
Follow me.
Come on.

2283
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,660
I-I-I...

2284
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:08,850
No peeking.

2285
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,450
Keep coming, keep coming,
keep coming.

2286
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:11,590
Come on,
keep coming.

2287
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:12,790
Keep coming,
keep coming.

2288
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:13,960
Mike...

2289
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,540
Follow the sultry
sound of my voice.

2290
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,600
Okay, stop.

2291
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,600
Open them.

2292
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,570
Ta-da!

2293
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,310
Mike...

2294
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,630
Is that...?

2295
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,930
Sorry it took

2296
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,100
so long, pal.

2297
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:28,580
It was a lot of wood
to go through.

2298
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,250
You know,
it only works

2299
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:32,270
if you have
every piece.

2300
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,400
( whirring hum )

2301
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,050
( creaking )

2302
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:01,260
Boo?

2303
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:03,050
BOO:
Kitty!

2304
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,290
( bouncy blues melody plays )

2305
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:19,060
Sulley:
* If I were a rich man *

2306
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:23,150
* With a million or two *

2307
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:26,130
Mike:
* I'd live in
a penthouse *

2308
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:30,730
* In a room
with a view *

2309
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:32,740
* And if I were handsome *

2310
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,780
No way.

2311
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:34,970
It could happen.

2312
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:39,160
* Those dreams
do come true *

2313
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:43,200
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

2314
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:47,150
* Wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

2315
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:50,890
* Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

2316
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:53,310
* Wouldn't have nothing *

2317
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:54,980
Can I tell
you something?

2318
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,250
* For years
I have envied *

2319
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:58,440
You were green with it.

2320
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,230
* Your grace
and your charm *

2321
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:07,090
* Everyone loves
you, you know *

2322
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:10,460
* Yes, I know,
I know, I know *

2323
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:13,830
* But I must admit it *

2324
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:18,260
* Big guy, you
always come through *

2325
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:23,500
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

2326
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:29,560
BOTH:
* You and me together *

2327
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:33,430
* That's how it
always should be *

2328
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:39,440
* One without the other
don't mean nothing to me *

2329
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:44,210
* Nothing to me *

2330
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,000
* Yeah, I wouldn't
be nothing *

2331
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:47,670
* No *

2332
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:51,190
* If I didn't
have you to serve *

2333
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:55,150
* I'm just a punky
little eyeball *

2334
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,930
* And a funky
optic nerve *

2335
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:02,790
* Hey, I never
told you this *

2336
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:05,550
* Sometimes I get
a little blue *

2337
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:07,220
Looks good on you.

2338
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,500
* But I wouldn't
have nothing *

2339
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:12,570
* If I didn't
have you... *

2340
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:16,060
Let's dance.

2341
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:18,340
Look, Ma,
I'm dancing!

2342
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,860
Would you let me lead?

2343
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:24,540
Look at that.
It's true.

2344
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,760
Big guys are light
on their feet.

2345
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:28,000
Don't you dare dip me.

2346
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,350
Don't you dare dip me,
don't you dare dip me.

2347
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,400
Ow. I should
have stretched.

2348
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,810
* Yes, I wouldn't
be nothing *

2349
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:38,390
* If I didn't have you *

2350
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,870
I know what you
mean, Sulley.

2351
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,890
* Because... *

2352
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,400
* I wouldn't know
where to go *

2353
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,740
* Me, too,
because I... *

2354
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,910
* Wouldn't know
what to do *

2355
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,660
Why do you keep
singing my part?

2356
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:50,490
BOTH:
* I don't have to say it *

2357
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,760
Ah, say it anyway.

2358
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,760
* 'Cause we... *

2359
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:55,430
* Both know it's true *

2360
01:27:55,540 --> 01:28:00,050
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

2361
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:03,900
* I wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

2362
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:08,280
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

2363
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:14,540
* Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you. *

2364
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:15,760
( music ends )

2365
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,780
One more time.

2366
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:19,630
( music begins again )

2367
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:20,600
lt worked!

2368
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,460
* I don't have
to say it *

2369
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:23,850
Where'd everybody
come from?

2370
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:25,990
* 'Cause we both
know it's true *

2371
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,000
Let's take it
home, big guy.

2372
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:32,020
BOTH:
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

2373
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:35,770
* I wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

2374
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:41,010
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

2375
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,240
* You, you *

2376
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:45,380
* A, E, I, O... *

2377
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,220
* That means you, yeah. *
