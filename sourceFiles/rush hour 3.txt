1
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:38,389
What the hell?!

2
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:40,620
I didn't tell you to go!
Goddamn!

3
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,180
- It was him!
- That was you!

4
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,257
Shit! Oh, man!

5
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,299
Ain't nobody listenin' today.

6
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:50,904
Ladies, you just dented
a '81 Cutlass Supreme.

7
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,786
I need to see your license
and registration.

8
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:54,455
Brother, you OK? You cool?

9
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,661
Ten minutes.
Doors open on my signal.

10
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,238
I'm glad you're here, Lee.

11
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,646
I always feel better
with you watching my back.

12
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,847
I'm just doing my job,
Mr. Ambassador.

13
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,871
Stay close today, Lee.

14
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:16,097
We're making history.

15
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,811
This is bullshit!
Do you know who I am?

16
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:24,062
My family owns
half of Rodeo Drive.

17
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:25,687
Do you know who I am?

18
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,899
Detective James Carter, LAPD.

19
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:29,817
My family owns half of
Crenshaw Boulevard.

20
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:30,858
I want a lawyer.

21
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:32,361
You need a personal trainer.

22
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:33,743
This license says 180 pounds.

23
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,176
You weigh more than
the damn car, girl.

24
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,538
- I have a thyroid condition.
- Well, stop eating thyroids.

25
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:41,601
Look, can't you just,
like give us a warning or something?

26
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:45,192
That depends.
You girls like Chinese?

27
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:49,839
Excuse me.

28
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,062
Carter.

29
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:52,613
Lee, we are on for tonight.

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,590
I just picked up two girls who wanna
play hide the little Asian policeman.

31
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:58,309
I can't talk now. I'm in the car
with Ambassador Han.

32
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,053
Trust me, these girls
are sushi grade.

33
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,365
- We gotta hit this!
- I have to go. I'm sorry.

34
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:03,903
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

35
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,267
You're mad because of what happened
when we was in New York.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,414
I don't want to talk about that.

37
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,738
It was three years ago.
When you gonna let it go?

38
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:12,257
Let it go? Isabella was my girlfriend.

39
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:13,333
Lee, we're friends, man.

40
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,551
Just come out with me one night.

41
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,551
The mu shu's on me.

42
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:18,269
Lee!

43
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:20,058
Ha.

44
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,056
My mom says hi.

45
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:53,374
The Chinese triads now have
half a million members...

46
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:55,915
in over 100 countries.

47
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,565
And these are not street kids shaking down
local merchants.

48
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:03,878
These are businessmen who have built
a $50 billion empire...

49
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:07,735
of extortion, drugs,
sex and slavery.

50
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:13,013
We must cut off the head of this snake
before it swallows us whole.

51
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,338
As chairman of
the World Criminal Court...

52
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:19,178
I have entrusted my good friend
Ambassador Han to lead the fight...

53
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:22,240
against the largest criminal
organization in the world.

54
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:32,488
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,056
Chairman Reynard,
ladies and gentlemen.

56
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:46,243
The triad society
is built on secrecy.

57
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:50,557
Nobody knows who these men are,
who controls them, who leads them.

58
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,105
Nobody has known for 500 years.

59
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:56,883
But today, I stand before you
with a secret of my own.

60
00:04:57,076 --> 00:05:01,582
Today, I will disclose information
that affects everyone in this room.

61
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:06,255
After years of searching,
I believe I've finally located Shy Shen.

62
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:10,729
Mr. Ambassador,
Shy Shen does not exist.

63
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:13,769
Excuse me, who is this Shy Shen?

64
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:15,418
With all due respect, sir, I li...

65
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:28,002
Everybody down!

66
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:29,663
Call an ambulance!

67
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:30,821
Someone get a doctor.

68
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:32,882
Ambassador down,
Ambassador down.

69
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,351
Stay with him.

70
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:50,473
Yugh!

71
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,971
Uh-uh-uh. Keepin' these
till I see you tonight.

72
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:13,382
Attention all units, shots have been fired
at the World Criminal Court building.

73
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,460
The Chinese Ambassador
has been shot.

74
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,991
Chinese Ambassador?
Move your asses over.

75
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,028
- Move over!
- What? Whoa. Shit!

76
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:00,442
What're you doing?!

77
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:01,871
Lee!

78
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,764
- Where the hell is he goin'?
- Ah!

79
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,846
LAPD! Get the hell outta the way!

80
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,633
People are crazy.

81
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,585
I'm-a give your ass a ticket
when I come back!

82
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,795
Lee, I'm comin'!

83
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,207
Ugh!

84
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:01,314
Don't move!

85
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,616
Hello, Lee.

86
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,459
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

87
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:47,644
Kenji!

88
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:52,036
You see?
I know you too well.

89
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,432
Aaaah!

90
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:04,902
- Ugh!
- Aaaah!

91
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,822
- Ungh.
- Lee, you OK?

92
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:15,177
We almost killed your ass.
Why you didn't move?

93
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,918
Ohh.

94
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:20,824
I'd like for you to meet our dates
for this evenin'. Masha and Zoe.

95
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,958
Urgh.

96
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:23,461
Fat one's yours.

97
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,111
How many times
do you want me to say it? I'm sorry.

98
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:32,998
I'm sorry I ran you over, man. Damn!

99
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,354
- Not now, Carter.
- Aww.

100
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:37,292
All right, hold it right there.
Don't say a word, Carter.

101
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,423
Captain Diel, I had nothin'
to do with this.

102
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,590
All I did was borrow a car,
backed up Lee.

103
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,667
Tell him, partner.

104
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:44,160
I need to see Ambassador Han.

105
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:46,359
The Ambassador
is just out of surgery.

106
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:48,976
The bullet missed his heart.
He's gonna be OK.

107
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:50,687
Captain, you have to give me
back my shield...

108
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:52,582
and put me on this case.
I made one little mistake.

109
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,800
- Take a brother off the bench.
- One little mistake?

110
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:56,593
You handcuffed two women
and stole their car.

111
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:58,230
Isn't that why we have insurance?

112
00:09:58,337 --> 00:09:59,930
Everyone has
an off day, Captain.

113
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,559
Last month you put
six Iranians in jail for a week!

114
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,196
You and I both know
them Iranians was terrorists.

115
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,415
They were scientists at UCLA!

116
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:08,561
Big deal.

117
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:09,955
'Cause they cure cancer in rats...

118
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,836
that doesn't mean
they won't blow shit up.

119
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:13,577
Let me find the person
who shot Ambassador Han.

120
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:16,555
Relax, Carter. The LAPD won't be leading
this investigation.

121
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,630
The Ambassador
is my responsibility.

122
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,375
Well, then maybe you could
tell me exactly how that shooter got away.

123
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:23,855
Thought so.

124
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:27,223
The Ambassador's daughter
is coming to see her father right now.

125
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:29,252
Make sure nothing happens to her.

126
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,406
Don't worry, Captain,
we're gonna make you proud.

127
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:33,478
And try not to think about
your wife leaving you.

128
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,033
She'll come back.

129
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,546
Soo Yung's here?

130
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,298
I haven't seen her
since she was ten years old.

131
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:40,382
She lives in Los Angeles now.

132
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:42,616
Let's go to the gift shop
and get her a little teddy bear.

133
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:46,394
And a bra.

134
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,432
- Lee!
- Soo Yung.

135
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,144
I'm so glad you're here.

136
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:52,546
- Detective Carter.
- Soo Yung.

137
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:55,306
- It's been so long.
- So long, Soo Yung.

138
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,637
So... So young.

139
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,416
- How is he?
- He's out of surgery.

140
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:02,473
They said he'll be OK.

141
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,792
Soo Yung, I'm sorry.

142
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:18,582
I want you both
to promise me something.

143
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:22,732
I want you to find the man
who did this to him.

144
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,891
I want you to find him because
I don't think he'll stop...

145
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,363
until my father is dead.

146
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,730
Soo Yung.

147
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:30,765
I need to hear you say it.

148
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:33,783
OK, I promise.

149
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:34,843
And so do I.

150
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,658
Thank you.

151
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:45,024
Soo Yung, your father was addressing
the court before he was shot.

152
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,621
Two weeks ago, my father
mailed me an envelope.

153
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,696
He said if anything ever
happened to him...

154
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,950
- I should give it to you.
- Where is it?

155
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,691
I put it in my locker
at the kung-fu studio where I teach.

156
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,290
It's at 8347 First Street...

157
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:03,377
Chinatown.

158
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,454
Go home, Carter.
This has nothing to do with you.

159
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,675
I made Soo Yung a promise,
the same as you.

160
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,293
This is the business of China.

161
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,895
Well, for your information,
I'm part Chinese now.

162
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,930
That's right, Lee.
For the last three years I've studied...

163
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,986
the ancient teachings of Buddha,
earning two black belts...

164
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,902
in wushu martial arts,
spending every afternoon...

165
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,253
at the Hong Kong Garden massage parlor
on Pico and Bundy.

166
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,693
I am half-Chinese, baby.

167
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:36,174
If you're half-Chinese,
I'm half-black.

168
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,223
I'm your brother and I'm fly.
You down with that, Snoopy?

169
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,851
That's dope, isn't it?

170
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,860
Sorry, Lee, you can't be black.
There's a height requirement.

171
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,174
Same as riding the Matterhorn.

172
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:46,277
Go home, Carter.

173
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:47,673
I can't leave you, Lee.

174
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:51,145
Can't leave my brother.

175
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:15,570
All right, listen up!
I need everyone's attention.

176
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,022
I'm Detective Carter,
this is Inspector Lee.

177
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:21,979
We need to see Soo Yung's
locker right now.

178
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,785
No one's allowed in the back
without the master's permission.

179
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:28,798
Maybe you didn't hear me.
We need to see that locker.

180
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,012
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Carter.

181
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:32,852
Lee, I got this.

182
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:36,181
Hey! Heh heh. Kids.

183
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:39,128
Listen. Violence will solve nothin'.

184
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:42,413
Now, as the Chinese say, all great battles
are won without fightin'.

185
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,764
- Sorry.
- OK?

186
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:45,063
I don't know him.

187
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,169
Now, let's just calm down
and put this...

188
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:47,402
- Haa!
- Ow!

189
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,897
God da...

190
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,969
OK...

191
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:55,723
I tried talkin'.

192
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:59,285
Hoo! Now I'm about to beat
the puberty out of y'all.

193
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:02,152
You ain't gonna see it comin'.
You ain't gonna see it comin', come on!

194
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:04,314
Waaa! Whoo!

195
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:06,329
Runnin' for your lives.

196
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:09,030
About time y'all showed
some respect around here.

197
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:13,148
- Huh?
- Carter, wait for the master.

198
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,719
Whoa! Damn!

199
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,476
Heh, I'm sorry, man.
I thought this was the bathroom.

200
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,803
Sorry.

201
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:27,830
Lee, I got a big problem, man.

202
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,268
This boy's on steroids.
He got a head like Barry Bonds.

203
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,546
- Oh, no.
- Come on, man.

204
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:33,576
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaah!

205
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:34,717
Ah!

206
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,626
Carter, are you OK?

207
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,398
Lee, Lee, get him, Lee!

208
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:39,455
Ooh!

209
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,102
Ahhh! Ah!

210
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:42,520
Ah!

211
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:44,074
Urgh!

212
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:45,739
Lee, let's get the hell outta...

213
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,310
Aah! My bunions!

214
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,391
Yah! Hyah! Mm! Ungh!

215
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:52,461
- Grr! Rargh!
- Ha ha ha.

216
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,824
Urgh! Whoo!

217
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,331
Oh! Aaaah!

218
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,463
Come on, man, let me go.
I love Chinese people!

219
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,121
Aaaah!

220
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,342
Wait. I don't...

221
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:11,446
Ah!

222
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:13,066
Urgh!

223
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:15,279
How do you say "surrender"
in Chinese?

224
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,093
Aaaah!

225
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:21,416
OK. I'm about to slice you up
like a giant California roll!

226
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:22,825
Raaah!

227
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:28,774
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Ha ha ha. Funny black man.

228
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:30,298
Ooh... Oh! Shit!

229
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,435
I'm not playin' no more.

230
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,154
Ahh!

231
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:37,244
Aaah!

232
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,908
- Lee, let go!
- Carter!

233
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:49,038
Grrrrr!

234
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,349
Down! Put us down!

235
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:54,917
Let me down! I'm sorry!

236
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,188
- Aaaaah!
- I'm sorry, man!

237
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:59,171
How the hell did we
get in this mess?

238
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:01,595
- Ugh!
- Agh!

239
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,178
May I help you?

240
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,181
We'll be asking
the questions, old man.

241
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:20,354
- Who are you?
- Yu.

242
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,131
- No, not me. You.
- Yes, I am Yu.

243
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:23,650
Just answer the damn questions.

244
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,370
- Who are you?
- I have told you.

245
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:27,453
- Are you deaf?
- No, Yu is blind.

246
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:28,760
I'm not blind, you blind.

247
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,151
- That is what I just said.
- You just said what?

248
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:33,837
- I did not say what, I said Yu.
- That's what I'm asking you.

249
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:35,842
- And Yu is answering.
- Shut up!

250
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:36,850
- You!
- Yes?

251
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:37,939
Not you, him!

252
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:39,170
- What's your name?
- Mi.

253
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,688
- Yes, you!
- I am Mi.

254
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:42,683
He is Mi, and I am Yu.

255
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:45,667
And I'm about to whup your old ass, man,
'cause I'm sick of playin' games!

256
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,931
You, me, everybody's ass
around here! Him!

257
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:50,378
- Carter, Carter.
- I'm-a kick his ass.

258
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,843
- I'm sick of this.
- Carter, let me handle this.

259
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:53,051
- Lee. No, Lee. No!
- Carter!

260
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,765
Go.

261
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,948
Let's go.

262
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:17,588
I don't know what the hell
you feedin' him...

263
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:20,511
- but he is too damn big!
- Carter. Go.

264
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:42,769
Where is everyone?

265
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,347
Where's all the damn cops?

266
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,902
- Lee.
- Where's security?

267
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:53,239
They were called away.

268
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:55,404
W... What's wrong?

269
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,158
Carter.

270
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:00,158
Aw, this ain't good.

271
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:02,410
They're coming for him.

272
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:03,968
What do we do?

273
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:17,863
No.

274
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:22,299
No!

275
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,077
Don't move, or I'll
blow your ass cheeks off.

276
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:28,573
Get back.

277
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:29,941
Ugh!

278
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,789
Who sent you?

279
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:35,198
Oh!

280
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:38,681
Don't move!

281
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,588
Lee, throw me a gun!

282
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,890
- Huh?
- Throw me a gun!

283
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,375
- Damn, Lee!
- Huh?

284
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,465
Lee! I thought you had my back!

285
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:23,368
Aaaaaah!

286
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:30,091
Ugh!

287
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:36,435
Soo Yung, one more!

288
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,204
Hyah!

289
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,124
Aaaaah!

290
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:46,690
Lee, I'm in trouble!
I need some assistance.

291
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:49,882
Here.

292
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,521
It's empty.

293
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:53,790
What?

294
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:57,692
Hah!

295
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,473
You see? I always got your back.

296
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:06,083
Why the hell you give me
an empty gun, then?

297
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:08,080
I didn't know.

298
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,331
You almost got me killed, Lee.

299
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,707
- Ah! Ahh!
- Who are you? Who sent you?

300
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:20,454
What the hell is that?

301
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,555
I think he's speaking French.

302
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:23,530
French? What kind of
Chinaman speak French?

303
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:25,073
Tell him to stop playin' around
and talk right.

304
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:26,738
How can I tell him?
I don't speak French.

305
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,855
Ah!

306
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:30,705
Talk right, man.

307
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,239
No! You're Asian.
Stop humiliatin' yourself.

308
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,606
Shut the hell up.
Shut up. Come here.

309
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:39,928
We're gonna need a few minutes
alone with this guy.

310
00:20:40,058 --> 00:20:42,196
Find someone here
who speaks French, please.

311
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:45,205
Speak English!

312
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:50,000
Uh, this is Sister Agnes
from the chapel upstairs.

313
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:52,785
She speaks fluent French
and has agreed to interpret for you.

314
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:54,725
Sister, we appreciate you doin' this.

315
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:55,766
My pleasure.

316
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,230
Sister Agnes,
please ask who sent him.

317
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,054
He says you're both making
a big mistake.

318
00:21:07,186 --> 00:21:09,128
That one day soon
you'll beg for mercy.

319
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:10,596
He also said...

320
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,250
What?

321
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,779
Please, Sister, we have to know.

322
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:15,974
There's lives at stake.

323
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:18,622
Well, he used the N-word.

324
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:20,704
What? The N-word?

325
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:22,839
- You tell this little motherf...
- Carter!

326
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:25,942
She's a nun.

327
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,805
Sister, you tell this piece of S-word
that I will personally F-word him up.

328
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:41,965
Did he say "Negro"?

329
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,952
He used the N-word again, but this time
he mentioned your grandmother.

330
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,772
You tell him
that his mama's a H!

331
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:50,988
Carter, I believe "whore" is
spelled with a W.

332
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,364
Right. W. And his sister's a W.

333
00:21:53,498 --> 00:21:55,352
And his grandmama's
a two-bit W...

334
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:57,375
who makes double
'cause she got no teeth!

335
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,191
You tell him I said that.

336
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:12,541
Did he say it again?

337
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,524
No. This time he called...

338
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:17,204
this gentleman a word
that means "cat"...

339
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:19,971
and another word that rhymes
with "maggot."

340
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:21,173
What?!

341
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:25,028
Well, you tell him he's an A.W.

342
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:27,619
Uh, Lee,
"hole" is spelled with a H.

343
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,360
I have a dictionary upstairs.

344
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:30,897
Just call him an asshole.

345
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,642
He says you've both been marked
for death, like Han and the girl.

346
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,493
Ooh. Sister, turn your back.
You don't want to see this.

347
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:43,588
Who is Shy Shen
and how do we find him?

348
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:46,083
Tell us right now or I'll cut your B's off
and shove 'em in your mouth.

349
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:48,390
- His beads?
- His beads, Sister.

350
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,927
His hairy, stinkin' beads.

351
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,449
Tell me somethin' now.

352
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:53,923
Lee, give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Lee.

353
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,741
It's over, brother. It's over. OK.

354
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:00,423
Who is Shy Shen?!

355
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,479
What did he say, Sister?

356
00:23:01,564 --> 00:23:02,939
He said "shoot me."

357
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,525
Lee, there's no bullets in here.

358
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:10,084
- I'm sorry.
- I am trying to kill somebody, man.

359
00:23:10,274 --> 00:23:12,859
Damn. OK.

360
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,187
You better tell me
something right now.

361
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:15,358
I'll send you right to heaven, man.

362
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:16,787
- I don't even care no more.
- Carter.

363
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:19,915
I'm marked for death.
I ain't got nothin' to lose.

364
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,931
That's right, Sister. Call the Lord and tell
him he 'bout to have some company.

365
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:24,942
Carter, stop.

366
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:26,940
Tell me something!

367
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:28,966
- Carter, enough.
- Oh, she's almost done.

368
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:31,427
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned!

369
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:33,316
He says wait!

370
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,715
- What did he say?
- 50 Franklin D. Roosevelt.

371
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:39,981
Genevieve.

372
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,793
Thank you.

373
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,484
Nice workin' with ya, Sister.

374
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:47,071
Anytime, brother.

375
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:50,786
50 FDR.

376
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,735
- It's an address.
- It's a wild goose chase.

377
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,238
Every city in America has
a street named after Roosevelt.

378
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:57,457
- And who is Genevieve?
- I don't know.

379
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:00,140
Soo Yung, we're getting you
out of here.

380
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:01,850
- Why?
- It's not safe for you here.

381
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:03,135
I won't leave him.

382
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:04,818
We have no choice.

383
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:32,009
- Soo Yung.
- Mr. Reynard.

384
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:34,850
I'm glad your father is OK.

385
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,618
My people won't leave his side.

386
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,352
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

387
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:39,704
So, let's go.

388
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:41,967
- Ah.
- Wh... Where am I going?

389
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:45,326
We're getting out of Los Angeles.
It's not safe for us.

390
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,541
Just a few days, Soo Yung.
I promise.

391
00:24:47,668 --> 00:24:50,222
You'll come with me
and my family to Paris.

392
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:55,481
OK.

393
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:00,635
Wait.

394
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:04,158
You made me a promise.

395
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:07,728
Don't forget.

396
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,177
My God.

397
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:24,354
We got a assassin in custody
who only speaks French...

398
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:26,992
a limo blows up
at the French Consulate...

399
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,916
and the next meeting of the World Court
is in Paris, two days from now.

400
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,289
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

401
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:33,360
Yeah.

402
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:35,138
That we go to Fiji,
we hide out for a year...

403
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:37,003
maybe change our names,
get jobs as bartenders...

404
00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:38,393
and I'm-a call you Kiko.

405
00:25:38,485 --> 00:25:41,202
We have to find Shy Shen
before he finds us.

406
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:42,727
We're going to Paris, aren't we?

407
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:44,479
Yes. Tonight.

408
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:58,107
Did you know the average French woman
is naked 34 percent of the time?

409
00:25:58,302 --> 00:25:59,993
We are not going there
to meet women.

410
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:05,092
You have to forget about her,
and let me hook you up.

411
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:08,025
Hook me up?
After what you did to Isabella?

412
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,773
It was an accident.

413
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:11,223
Besides, you never even
slept with her.

414
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:13,736
Thanks to you.
It was going to happen.

415
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:15,227
But you just had to ruin it.

416
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,497
What did I do that was so terrible?

417
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:19,042
You shot my girlfriend.
In the neck!

418
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:20,466
There's nothing else to say.

419
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:21,670
It's not like she died.

420
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,662
So she has droopy eyes.
So she works at El Poco Loco.

421
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:26,235
That was temporary.

422
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,753
As soon as she could blink,
the Secret Service took her back.

423
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:31,804
You know what your problem is?
You need to relax, have some fun.

424
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,524
You have too much rice in your diet.
You're constipated.

425
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:36,134
I never should have brought you.

426
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,582
Face it, you need me, brother.

427
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:40,972
I don't need anyone.
And please don't call me brother.

428
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:42,093
What is this?

429
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:44,286
Underground gentleman's club
in Paris.

430
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:46,139
"Club La Passe"? Forget it.

431
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:48,324
Check out the address.

432
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:50,755
"50 Franklin D... Roosevelt."

433
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:53,093
Like I said, you need me.

434
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:57,731
'Scuse me. Can we have one
gefilte fish and some Ex-Lax?

435
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:07,000
Where the bags at, man?

436
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:10,827
Excuse me, gentlemen.

437
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:13,877
Commissaire Revi of the DST.
Would you please come with me?

438
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:15,289
Why?

439
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,998
Just need to ask you
a few questions.

440
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:21,531
Oh! Oh! Man!
Goddamn, man!

441
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:25,429
Oh! Man, this is by far the worst airport
I ever been to.

442
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,183
Oh!

443
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,785
- Ooph!
- Ah, man!

444
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:31,160
Now that I have your attention,
why don't you tell me...

445
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:33,333
what you cops are looking for
here in Paris.

446
00:27:33,463 --> 00:27:35,699
I told you, man. We on vacation.

447
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:37,238
Just taking in the sights.

448
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,668
Gentlemen, this is my city...

449
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:42,453
and I'm responsible
if two stupid cops come here...

450
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:45,159
and get their heads
blown off by the triads.

451
00:27:45,308 --> 00:27:49,269
Now, I can't force you to leave,
but I can make the suggestion.

452
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:54,017
After all, I found this dirty little gun
inside your jacket.

453
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:58,048
Which means you could both
do 20 years in my jail.

454
00:27:58,255 --> 00:27:59,748
Do we understand each other?

455
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:02,910
Do we understand each other?

456
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:07,051
Excellent. It was wonderful
meeting you both.

457
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:10,820
So we can go now?

458
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:12,720
This will just take a moment.

459
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,524
Welcome to Paris.

460
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,042
Oh, shit.

461
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,602
Ohh. Ohhh.

462
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:30,918
- Ahh.
- Where you go?

463
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:32,941
- Ugh.
- 50 Franklin, uh...

464
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:34,069
D. Roosevelt.

465
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:35,945
No. Get out.

466
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:37,618
- What?
- I don't drive his kind.

467
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:39,187
- My kind?
- Americans.

468
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:40,604
I don't drive Americans.

469
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:42,604
- But I'm Chinese.
- Yeah, but you're with him...

470
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,454
and they're the most
violent people on earth.

471
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,804
Always starting wars,
always killing people.

472
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,528
Americans make me sick.

473
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:50,579
Look, man, we are not
in the mood for this.

474
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:53,324
Me and my partner just got violated
by a small Frenchman.

475
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:54,969
Wearing a very large ring.

476
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:58,524
You're a pathetic bunch of criminals
who always resort to violence.

477
00:28:58,712 --> 00:29:00,119
Always push around the little guy.

478
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,938
Hey, that stuff ain't true.
America's not violent!

479
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,904
Come on, America is a joke.

480
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,906
You lost in Vietnam,
you lost in Iraq.

481
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:08,440
You can't even beat the Europeans
in basketball anymore.

482
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,996
The Dream Team is dead.

483
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,360
Ha ha. I didn't hear you, man.

484
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:14,793
Talk about the NBA again,
I dare ya. I double-dare ya.

485
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:17,099
Even your skinny women disgust me.

486
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:19,019
- Halle Berry.
- Wh...? Aw, hell no.

487
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:20,276
Now you done gone too far.

488
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:21,861
You want violence,
smelly Frenchman? Huh?

489
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,628
Do you want violence?
Well, you got it!

490
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:25,625
- Carter, put the gun down.
- Say you love America.

491
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:28,040
I love America.
Please, don't kill me.

492
00:29:28,175 --> 00:29:29,452
Sing the national anthem!

493
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:33,317
Not that one, man!
Sing the American one.

494
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:34,757
Don't know it.

495
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:39,124
# Oh, say can you see #

496
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:43,101
# Oh, say can you see #

497
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,836
# By the dawn's early light #

498
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:49,896
# Ah-doo da-doo-dee light... #

499
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:22,046
Wait for us here, George.

500
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:38,218
Ooh la la. Lee.

501
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:39,871
Carter, stay focused.

502
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,606
We're looking for Genevieve.

503
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,911
Let's split up.
I'll take the women.

504
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:11,991
Carter. James Carter.

505
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:19,603
I know you probably don't understand
a word I'm saying...

506
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:20,995
but I gotta tell you...

507
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,388
you're the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in my life.

508
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,659
And I'd like to strip you down
and butter you...

509
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,645
like a slice of Wonder Bread.

510
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:31,370
And shave your armpits and pour honey
all over your naked body.

511
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:34,562
And for the next two weeks
pretend I was a hungry bear.

512
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:38,988
Well, James Carter,
I happen to speak six languages.

513
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:40,797
One of 'em English?

514
00:31:42,438 --> 00:31:44,478
Are you in or out?

515
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:49,806
Money plays.

516
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:51,800
Sir, it's a thousand-euro minimum.

517
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:53,320
How much I'm short?

518
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,304
930 euros.

519
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:57,490
- Heh.
- It's OK.

520
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,312
Let him play.

521
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:00,438
Thank you.

522
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:01,767
Changez.

523
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:02,786
- Changez.
- Changez.

524
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,809
Changez?

525
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:20,664
I'm looking for Genevieve.

526
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:30,143
Maybe I can help you.

527
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:36,085
Do you know what
I hate about cops?

528
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:39,919
Even when they're
with a woman...

529
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:43,289
they can't stop thinking
about getting their man.

530
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:46,116
Who is Shy Shen?

531
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:47,544
See what I mean?

532
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:53,216
Come upstairs, cop.
I'll give you what you want.

533
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,061
- Hit me.
- Monsieur, this is baccarat.

534
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:02,393
I know that!

535
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:04,688
You think I don't know
baccarack when I play it?

536
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:06,543
When I was a kid,
me and my friends and I...

537
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:08,281
used to hang out in front of
the Magic Johnson Theater...

538
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,495
and play baccarack all night long.

539
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:12,511
Now hit me.

540
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,705
Three kings.
Read 'em and weep.

541
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,180
Three kings is a zero.

542
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:28,663
You have the worst possible hand.
You lose.

543
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:30,270
What?

544
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,574
Ah, madame has a 7.

545
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,016
She wins 100,000 euros. Bravo.

546
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:39,704
Mr. Carter, it appears you have
brought me luck.

547
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:42,154
I'd like to bring you
breakfast in bed.

548
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,720
Excuse me.

549
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,944
Way to go, Lee.

550
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,141
Today, my boy becomes a man.

551
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,765
Why are you helping me?

552
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,177
Maybe I'm helping myself.

553
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:08,134
How do I find Genevieve?

554
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,516
I see you like to get right to it.

555
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,242
Do you know Shy Shen?

556
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,040
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

557
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:17,430
Yes, please.

558
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,473
Someone's gonna die here tonight.

559
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,408
And it's you.

560
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:29,742
- Huh! Huh!
- Ugh!

561
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,841
- Huh!
- Ahh!

562
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:36,230
Unh!

563
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:37,714
- Unh!
- Ah!

564
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,016
- Uh!
- Urgh! Ah!

565
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:44,341
Ohh! Ah! Oh!

566
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,817
Ugh! Grrrrr!

567
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:50,124
Ohhh!

568
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,748
Ohhh!

569
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:54,026
Ah! Ahhh!

570
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:56,297
- Nngh! Guh!
- Oh! Ah!

571
00:34:56,426 --> 00:34:57,505
- Gnnh!
- Ahhh!

572
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:11,309
Come on, crouching tiger,
don't hide that dragon.

573
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,935
- Uh!
- Aaah!

574
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:28,108
Do it, Lee.
You tear that ass up.

575
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,112
- Ahh!
- Oh, oh!

576
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,595
You are a super freak!

577
00:35:42,704 --> 00:35:44,014
Carter!

578
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:45,283
Oh!

579
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:46,648
- Run!
- Oh!

580
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:54,557
- Ahh!
- Sorry.

581
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:56,404
- You got a boyfriend?
- Carter!

582
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:00,193
Start the car.

583
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:02,654
- Start the car!
- Drive fast!

584
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:26,466
Carter. Look!

585
00:36:26,614 --> 00:36:29,264
Uh, George?
We need you to go faster, man.

586
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:30,529
No. Forget it.

587
00:36:30,617 --> 00:36:33,749
You wanna kill me,
then go ahead, kill me.

588
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:35,894
- Ahh!
- Drive faster!

589
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:40,316
Please! I'm scared!

590
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:41,952
George, you watch
American movies?

591
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:43,076
- Yeah.
- OK, man. All right.

592
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:45,169
Listen, you're a super-spy.

593
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:47,784
A super-spy.

594
00:36:47,936 --> 00:36:50,587
Now drive this cab.

595
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:52,332
- Come on.
- OK.

596
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:55,048
I'm a super-spy.

597
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:08,710
Oh, shit, George. Go!

598
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:14,208
- Aah!
- George...

599
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:15,951
When I tell you to,
hit the brakes.

600
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,128
Now!

601
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,918
Oh, they got guns, Lee!

602
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,732
- Ungh!
- Ah!

603
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,936
- Ungh!
- Back up!

604
00:37:44,524 --> 00:37:45,735
Argh!

605
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,932
Way to go, George.

606
00:37:51,596 --> 00:37:52,458
It's OK.

607
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:57,613
Uh!

608
00:37:57,702 --> 00:37:58,650
Aah!

609
00:37:59,672 --> 00:38:00,620
Hey!

610
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:10,942
I got this one.

611
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,626
Aah!

612
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,824
Oh! Whoa! He's got my leg!

613
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,531
Aaaah!

614
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:20,151
Lee! God!

615
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:24,765
- Aaaaah!
- Hold m...

616
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:26,043
Ah!

617
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:33,115
Get your own damn cab.

618
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:42,319
Ow!

619
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:43,787
Lee!

620
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:45,507
- Urgh!
- Yah!

621
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,225
Yeah! Whoa!

622
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:49,627
- Ungh!
- Oh!

623
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,470
The French are neutral!
This is not my fight!

624
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:53,572
This is not...!

625
00:38:56,326 --> 00:39:00,352
Ah! Lee, I'm alive.

626
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:02,419
My whole life flashed in front of me.

627
00:39:02,535 --> 00:39:04,193
In three years I'll be married
to a Chinese woman.

628
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:06,986
We had three kids looked just like you,
only a little darker.

629
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:08,065
- Carter.
- What?

630
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,895
Put your hands up.

631
00:39:10,006 --> 00:39:11,828
What you talkin' 'bout?

632
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:13,698
Whoa!

633
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,608
Some people say the modern world
was invented...

634
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:36,445
when the French built
these sewers.

635
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,731
10 million gallons pumped
through every hour.

636
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:43,032
A marvel that no one ever sees.

637
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:45,247
Welcome to Paris, Lee.

638
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:46,747
Lee, you know this clown?

639
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:50,552
Go on, Lee. Tell him who I am.
Don't be shy.

640
00:39:50,744 --> 00:39:52,686
Introduce him
to your shyong dih.

641
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:55,466
Shyong dih? Your brother?

642
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:57,144
He doesn't talk about me much.

643
00:39:57,252 --> 00:40:00,188
In fact, he's spent his whole life
trying to forget me.

644
00:40:00,355 --> 00:40:02,875
How would it look if Hong Kong's
great Inspector Lee...

645
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:05,544
had a brother on the wrong side
of the law?

646
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,084
You're not my brother anymore.

647
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:27,547
Let me repay the favor, Lee.

648
00:40:27,714 --> 00:40:31,326
I'll allow you to live
if you promise to leave Paris tonight.

649
00:40:31,518 --> 00:40:34,169
You got a deal. Thank you
for showin' us the sewer.

650
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,873
Listen, that's a badass suit.
Let's get the hell outta here.

651
00:40:37,023 --> 00:40:39,511
What about Han and his daughter?

652
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,318
There is nothing I can do for them.

653
00:40:42,529 --> 00:40:45,180
- I have no choice.
- Then I have no choice.

654
00:40:45,332 --> 00:40:48,332
Well, I guess he's stayin'.
Who wanna take me to the airport?

655
00:40:50,537 --> 00:40:52,609
We'll always be brothers, Lee.

656
00:40:52,738 --> 00:40:55,127
In this life and the next.

657
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:01,237
Tell me, Kenji, who's Shy Shen?

658
00:41:02,616 --> 00:41:05,748
Some secrets are worth dying for.

659
00:41:06,688 --> 00:41:09,022
Oh. OK. A... All right. OK.

660
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:12,628
Lee, what the hell is goin' on?

661
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:19,941
Go!

662
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:21,822
Hey, which way, man?

663
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:34,132
- Shit, Lee, it's locked!
- Over here!

664
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:35,872
- Lee!
- We have to jump!

665
00:41:36,984 --> 00:41:39,405
- Ooph.
- Oh, that's the sewer!

666
00:41:39,552 --> 00:41:41,495
- Hell no, Lee!
- No choice!

667
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:42,799
- I'd rather die.
- Come on!

668
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,716
Oh!

669
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:50,266
Shi-i-i-i-i-it!

670
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:56,192
I'm gonna kill you, Lee!

671
00:42:04,977 --> 00:42:07,181
Bonjour. Welcome to
the Plaza Athenee.

672
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:08,359
How may I help you?

673
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:11,446
It's great to see you again.
It's been too long.

674
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:13,023
Yes, far too long, sir.

675
00:42:13,118 --> 00:42:15,966
Listen, I need a big suite,
two beds, two showers...

676
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,502
a massage therapist, some new clothes
and a case of Old Spice.

677
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,990
It's all your fault.
How come you didn't tell me about Kenji?

678
00:42:26,161 --> 00:42:28,332
It was none of your business.

679
00:42:28,466 --> 00:42:32,208
In case you missed it, man,
people are tryin' to kill me.

680
00:42:32,402 --> 00:42:35,120
I'm covered in shit and some French cops
whupped my ass...

681
00:42:35,272 --> 00:42:36,549
with some Yellow Pages, man.

682
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:38,169
So don't tell me it ain't
none of my business.

683
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:39,703
You're lucky we're not
in Hong Kong.

684
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,239
Phone book is twice as big.

685
00:42:41,344 --> 00:42:43,449
Why you didn't tell me
you had a brother, man?

686
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,540
Oh, hell, no...

687
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:50,435
- Lady.
- Oui?

688
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,040
This damn dog just pissed on me.

689
00:42:53,189 --> 00:42:54,782
Good girl.

690
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:00,145
You know what I think?

691
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:03,266
I think you feel sorry for this guy.

692
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:05,344
Maybe Kenji didn't get away in LA.

693
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:09,379
Maybe you let him go.

694
00:43:09,508 --> 00:43:13,818
The yakuza killed his family in Tokyo.
He was sent to China when he was 7.

695
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:18,323
He was put in Chenzhou,
the orphanage where I grew up.

696
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,622
We kept each other alive.

697
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:23,949
You protected each other.
And you're still protectin' him.

698
00:43:25,658 --> 00:43:27,447
I call him shyong dih.

699
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,950
He was like my brother.

700
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:32,070
And then I left him.

701
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:34,107
You was adopted.
What choice did you have?

702
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:36,239
He ended up on the streets.

703
00:43:37,902 --> 00:43:39,396
You could never understand.

704
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:41,030
I understand, man.
I got a brother.

705
00:43:41,138 --> 00:43:42,087
My little brother Perry.

706
00:43:42,174 --> 00:43:44,313
We used to be best friends.
Now we don't even speak.

707
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:47,060
He think I tipped off the cops
about his chicken fights in his garage.

708
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:49,600
Can you believe that?
My own brother think I'm a snitch.

709
00:43:49,747 --> 00:43:51,471
Just 'cause my chicken lost
in the semifinals.

710
00:43:51,581 --> 00:43:52,509
I didn't even really care.

711
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:53,793
- Carter.
- Fight was fixed, man.

712
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:55,770
My bird was fightin' a chicken
that didn't make his weight.

713
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:56,900
And he still went the distance.

714
00:43:56,986 --> 00:43:59,288
He had a lotta heart.
And he was delicious.

715
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:02,738
It's best if I do this on my own.
This fight is personal.

716
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:04,419
Lemme help you, man.
I'm-a tell you right now...

717
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:05,989
whatever Kenji's
tellin' you, it ain't true.

718
00:44:06,096 --> 00:44:08,715
- He ain't your brother.
- And you are not my brother.

719
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:11,373
Huh.

720
00:44:13,636 --> 00:44:15,643
Fine.

721
00:44:15,772 --> 00:44:17,944
I'm not your brother.

722
00:44:28,718 --> 00:44:32,613
# What have I got to do
to make you love me? #

723
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:39,727
# Sorry seems to be
the hardest word #

724
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:44,857
- # It's sad #
- # So sad #

725
00:44:44,966 --> 00:44:46,624
# So sad #

726
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:50,411
# It's a sad, sad situation #

727
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:54,914
# And it's getting more and more absurd #

728
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,218
Wow. Holy smokes!

729
00:44:58,346 --> 00:44:59,840
- # It's sad #
- Crash landing!

730
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:02,816
- # So sad #
- Short Round... step on it!

731
00:45:02,987 --> 00:45:05,802
Okey-dokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

732
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:08,509
# Always seems to me #

733
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:09,837
# That sorry... #

734
00:45:09,926 --> 00:45:13,700
Yes, I would like to order
some fried chicken, please.

735
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:16,166
Oh, and some sweet-potato pie.

736
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,248
Merci.

737
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:20,668
Enjoy your mu shu, sir.

738
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:22,712
- Merci.
- Goodbye.

739
00:45:24,674 --> 00:45:26,332
# East Coast girl are 'ip #

740
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,848
# I really dig those styles
they wear #

741
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:34,461
# And southern girls
with the way they talk #

742
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:38,392
# They knock me out
when I'm down there #

743
00:45:38,585 --> 00:45:41,619
# The Midwest
farmers' daughters #

744
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:45,301
# Really make you feel all right #

745
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,972
# And the northerns girls
with the way they kiss #

746
00:45:49,161 --> 00:45:53,057
# They keep their boyfriend
warm at night #

747
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:56,845
# I wish they all could
be California #

748
00:45:57,038 --> 00:46:00,388
# I wish they all could be California #

749
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:03,990
# I wish they all
could be California...  #

750
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:06,120
Hm. "Genevieve."

751
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:15,460
Phew.

752
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:22,094
- Oh.
- Hello, Inspector.

753
00:46:22,262 --> 00:46:23,571
Minister Reynard.

754
00:46:23,663 --> 00:46:26,412
They want to kill me.
Me and my family.

755
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:28,540
A dozen agents
from the French secret police...

756
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:31,569
have already been murdered...
only this last month.

757
00:46:31,736 --> 00:46:34,224
We are at war with the triads,
right here in my own city.

758
00:46:34,372 --> 00:46:35,964
Who is Shy Shen?

759
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:39,271
Ah, Shy Shen... uh...
Shy Shen is not a person.

760
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:40,872
It's a list.

761
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:43,119
- A list?
- Yes.

762
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:46,095
Every 5 years, the triad bosses
come together...

763
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:49,548
for an election, and during that ceremony
they choose the men...

764
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:51,990
who will lead the triads.

765
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:54,263
- Dragon heads.
- Yes.

766
00:46:54,393 --> 00:46:56,564
13 dragon heads who will control...

767
00:46:56,695 --> 00:46:59,313
the largest criminal organization
in the world.

768
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:04,003
And their 13 names are inscribed
on the list known as Shy Shen.

769
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:07,016
A list which has been handed
down and kept secret...

770
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:09,889
from generation to generation.

771
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:12,595
If the names on that list
were ever to get out...

772
00:47:12,745 --> 00:47:15,843
well, the secret society
wouldn't be so secret anymore...

773
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:18,885
and they would all end up in jail,
or dead.

774
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,708
And the list is somewhere in Paris?

775
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:25,161
A young lady named Genevieve
made contact with Ambassador Han...

776
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:27,299
and we believe she knows where it is.

777
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:32,846
I'm asking for your help, Inspector.

778
00:47:32,997 --> 00:47:36,030
Finish what Ambassador Han started.

779
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,023
Get to the girl before the triads do
and you'll get Shy Shen.

780
00:48:07,096 --> 00:48:08,340
Ha ha ha!

781
00:48:18,806 --> 00:48:20,498
Ca va, oui, oui, voulez-vous.

782
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:23,030
I don't understand.
Who are you?

783
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,122
- Who am I?
- Oui.

784
00:48:25,246 --> 00:48:28,923
I'm Bubbles.
The new costume designer!

785
00:48:29,118 --> 00:48:31,093
Has anyone seen Genevieve?

786
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,912
Uh, she has her own
dressing room.

787
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,430
Ah.

788
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:37,352
Wait. Bubbles.

789
00:48:38,695 --> 00:48:40,256
Uh, do we look OK?

790
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:52,317
No. No, no.

791
00:48:52,408 --> 00:48:53,968
These costumes are terrible!

792
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:56,759
Ladies, please, we have work to do!

793
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:39,967
First, I will dress the blondes.

794
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:48,632
And then...

795
00:49:48,763 --> 00:49:50,935
the brunettes.

796
00:49:53,968 --> 00:49:56,271
And finally...

797
00:49:56,404 --> 00:49:57,930
the hybrids.

798
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:07,122
The Lord have truly bless you all
with tremendous talent...

799
00:50:07,348 --> 00:50:09,006
trust me.

800
00:50:10,686 --> 00:50:15,159
And some of you have
what I like to call...

801
00:50:15,391 --> 00:50:18,686
silver-dollar potential.

802
00:50:25,365 --> 00:50:27,537
# Vous avez lu I'histoire de Jesse James? #

803
00:50:30,105 --> 00:50:33,105

Lee! What you doin' here?

807
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:44,376
What are you doing here?

808
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,075
- I found Genevieve.
- So did I.

809
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:47,811
- They're gonna kill her.
- What?

810
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,742
- Look.
- # Comment il vcut #

811
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:53,205

00:50:53,392 --> 00:50:54,570
# Ca vous a plu, hein? #

813
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,825
- Lee, you get the lights, I'll get the girl.
- Oh.

814
00:50:57,997 --> 00:51:01,259
# Et bien, coutez I'histoire #

- Your life is in danger.
- What the hell's going on?

832
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,077
You step into that spotlight,
it's the last step you ever gonna take.

833
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,855
They're gonna kill you right now.

834
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:21,389

# Bonnie and Clyde #

838
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:29,885
Sorry, James.
It's time for my solo.

00:52:30,018 --> 00:52:32,920
# Bonnie and Clyde #

840
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:39,864
You gotta come with me now, girl.

841
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:55,090
# The closer I get to you #

842
00:53:00,214 --> 00:53:05,582

# Over and over again #

# I tried to tell myself that we #

847
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:35,021
# Could never be
more than friends #

848
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:36,262
# And all the while #

849
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:40,407
# Inside I knew it was real #

850
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:46,502
# The way you make me feel #

# Sweeter and sweeter

00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:53,664
# And heaven's there for those #

853
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,587
- What's happening?
- # Who fooled...  #

854
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:00,985
Get your hands off me!

855
00:54:01,073 --> 00:54:02,633
We are friends of Ambassador Han.

856
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:04,203
Trust us, girl.

857
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:24,705
Taxi.

858
00:54:24,797 --> 00:54:26,520
Taxi!

859
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:27,941
- Get in.
- It's George!

860
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:29,461
Go, go, go.

861
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:35,193
I've been looking for you
all day, my friend.

862
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,355
We need to talk.

863
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,481
Forget it, George.
We're not paying for any damages.

864
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,551
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want you to pay.

865
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:43,679
I wanna ask if I could
drive you full time no charge.

866
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:44,830
Why you want to drive us?

867
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:48,178
Today was amazing.
The guns, the shooting.

868
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:50,622
Now I understand
what it is to be an American.

869
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,373
Please, I'm begging you.
Let me be your driver.

870
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,076
Let me kill someone tonight!

871
00:54:56,225 --> 00:54:58,200
You'll never be an American, OK?

872
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:00,435
I'll drink this shit all day if I have to.

873
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:01,840
Just give me a chance.

874
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:03,820
All right, fine.
Get us to the Plaza, fast.

875
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,974
You got it, boss.

876
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:07,030
Hold on.

877
00:55:16,678 --> 00:55:19,134
So you think she stole this
Shy Shen list from the triads?

878
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:21,104
Only one way to find out.

879
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:22,625
You thinking what I'm thinking?

880
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,022
We need her to talk.
Get her relaxed.

881
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,228
Maybe open up some wine
from the minibar.

882
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,820
Wow.

883
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:34,107
Maybe we should put on
a dirty movie.

884
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:36,140
- Lee!
- Only 9.95.

885
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,924
This our chance to find Shy Shen.

886
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,630
I'm goin' in.

887
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:41,981
What's wrong with you?

888
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:43,381
Wait, let me go with you.

889
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,478
Some things a man has to do
on his own.

890
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:56,025
You OK?

891
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,159
Kenji must have figured out
what I've done.

892
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,263
I'm as good as dead.

893
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,225
You stole the list, didn't you?
You tried to sell it to Han?

894
00:56:05,761 --> 00:56:09,373
You don't get it.
I'm one of them.

895
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:12,118
And if I'm dead, you're dead.

896
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:24,491
Hey, we're safe.
No one knows we're here.

897
00:56:24,746 --> 00:56:25,990
Just relax.

898
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,398
No one is safe.

899
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:30,926
I'm marked.

900
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,165
Trust me.

901
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:33,715
Now why should I trust you?

902
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:35,578
As the Chinese say...

903
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:39,771
What does that mean?

904
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:42,545
"A donkey's lips will not fit
on a horse's mouth."

905
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:46,260
I'm not sure how that applies.

906
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:51,828
Well, I was just thinking
you had nice lips.

907
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,529
That's all.

908
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:59,377
You saved my life today.
Thank you, Carter.

909
00:56:59,547 --> 00:57:02,165
Oh, please. Call me James.

910
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:03,625
Or Stallion.

911
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:06,947
No one's saved me
in a long time.

912
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:08,462
How can I repay you?

913
00:57:08,556 --> 00:57:10,082
You got 20 bucks?

914
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,289
How 'bout ten?

915
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:17,484
Oh, man. Mmm.

916
00:57:17,598 --> 00:57:18,677
- James.
- What?

917
00:57:18,764 --> 00:57:20,074
- I'm bad.
- I'm bad too.

918
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:21,247
I'm a bad girl.

919
00:57:21,334 --> 00:57:23,190
Hallelujah!

920
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:33,334
Oh, yeah.
That's it, baby. Yeah. Uh-oh.

921
00:57:33,448 --> 00:57:35,041
Ha ha. Oh, yeah. That's it, baby.

922
00:57:35,149 --> 00:57:37,484
Oh, yeah. Bite that ear.
Punish that ear.

923
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:38,928
Do what you wanna do.

924
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:40,876
Oh, baby... Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

925
00:57:40,988 --> 00:57:42,395
My nipples are sensitive.
Be careful down there.

926
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:44,595
I've never been with
an American man before.

927
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:45,806
Neither have I.

928
00:57:45,893 --> 00:57:48,315
I feel so safe with you.
Do you want me?

929
00:57:48,463 --> 00:57:51,659
Ha. How you say "Twice now
and once in the shower" in French?

930
00:57:51,832 --> 00:57:54,166
Wait here. I'm going
to the bathroom.

931
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,188
Make myself more comfortable.

932
00:57:57,838 --> 00:57:59,212
You need some matches?

933
00:57:59,306 --> 00:58:01,989
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

934
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:06,189
Hello, room service?

935
00:58:06,279 --> 00:58:08,287
Send me up a bottle of honey
and some Red Bull.

936
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:39,551
Do you like it?

937
00:58:39,644 --> 00:58:42,612
No wonder Lance Armstrong
came all the way here to ride a bike.

938
00:58:43,882 --> 00:58:45,343
Merci beaucoup.

939
00:58:49,422 --> 00:58:50,731
Oui, baby, oui!

940
00:58:53,157 --> 00:58:55,045
Oh, yeah.

941
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,350
Voulez... vous
coucher avec moi, baby?

942
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,058
Je t'aime.

943
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,411
Voulez-vous.

944
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:04,842
Oh, yeah.

945
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:07,519
Je t'aime, baby, je t'aime!

946
00:59:10,473 --> 00:59:12,000
Freeze! Don't move!

947
00:59:13,077 --> 00:59:14,932
Ah! Shit! Damn!

948
00:59:22,951 --> 00:59:24,380
- I'm shot.
- It's OK, it's OK.

949
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:25,763
It's just a flesh wound.
It's OK. Gen...

950
00:59:25,856 --> 00:59:26,968
Genevieve, Genevieve,
let me help you.

951
00:59:27,057 --> 00:59:27,984
- Let me help you, baby.
- I'm terribly sorry.

952
00:59:28,057 --> 00:59:29,203
- I'm OK.
- Where you going?

953
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,080
Je... Damn.

954
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:33,430
So we even now, huh?
Is that it?

955
00:59:33,566 --> 00:59:35,158
I shoot your girl,
you shoot my girl?

956
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:36,826
I was trying to save your life.

957
00:59:36,936 --> 00:59:38,048
Well, you couldn't wait five minutes?

958
00:59:38,136 --> 00:59:39,991
We... We was about to
make love, man!

959
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:41,033
And you ruin it.

960
00:59:41,106 --> 00:59:44,173
They will be coming for us.
We have to get out of here now.

961
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:46,350
You hear that?
We have to get out of here now.

962
00:59:46,478 --> 00:59:48,365
- Damn, Lee! Damn you.
- Sorry.

963
00:59:48,481 --> 00:59:50,303
Next time I'm getting
my own damn room.

964
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:54,925
Get them out, George.

965
00:59:55,021 --> 00:59:57,573
These people are danger,
they're bleeding.

966
00:59:57,722 --> 00:59:59,250
How can you bring them
to our home?

967
00:59:59,356 --> 01:00:01,974
Paulette, there is something
you should know.

968
01:00:02,126 --> 01:00:03,752
I'm not what you think I am.

969
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:06,804
Are you telling me you're gay?

970
01:00:11,635 --> 01:00:15,312
I'm trying tell you...
I'm an American spy.

971
01:00:15,505 --> 01:00:16,999
Ha. You a spy?

972
01:00:17,105 --> 01:00:19,079
Yes, I'm working undercover
with the police.

973
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:20,352
We're about to crack a big case!

974
01:00:20,444 --> 01:00:23,094
Shut your mouth, George.
Not another word.

975
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:26,376
You're a stupid cab driver,
like your father was a stupid cab driver.

976
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:27,956
What kind of case could you crack?

977
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:29,326
Can't talk about it.

978
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:35,482
From this moment on, don't ever ask me
about my business!

979
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:38,767
Come with me, schmuck. Now.

980
01:00:45,366 --> 01:00:46,828
We need to get out of the city.

981
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:50,033
We're not going anywhere till you tell us
exactly what's going on.

982
01:00:50,205 --> 01:00:51,700
Did you steal that list
from the triads?

983
01:00:51,807 --> 01:00:54,807
Genevieve, we cannot help you
until you tell us the truth.

984
01:00:54,976 --> 01:00:56,917
Where is Shy Shen?

985
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,889
It's right here.

986
01:01:01,882 --> 01:01:04,248
Holy mother of Jesus!
She's a man.

987
01:01:04,385 --> 01:01:06,937
I went to second base
with a damn Frenchman.

988
01:01:07,086 --> 01:01:08,396
It's The Crying Games.

989
01:01:08,489 --> 01:01:10,312
I'm Brokeback Carter. Oh, God.

990
01:01:10,422 --> 01:01:12,113
I'm not a man. It's just a wig.

991
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:14,364
You sure about that? Huh?

992
01:01:14,495 --> 01:01:16,153
Lee, go over there
and check the hardware.

993
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:18,433
If she got anything in her bag
bigger than a three-iron...

994
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:19,809
we gonna beat his ass!

995
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:22,354
I'm a woman, James.
A woman who needs a way out.

996
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:23,745
You have to help me.

997
01:01:23,837 --> 01:01:25,780
- You have Shy Shen?
- No.

998
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:27,814
I am Shy Shen.

999
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:39,359
In ancient times, when the triads
would select new leaders...

1000
01:01:39,555 --> 01:01:42,271
they would secretly tattoo
the names onto a woman...

1001
01:01:43,725 --> 01:01:46,474
a woman who could carry
the list of Shy Shen...

1002
01:01:46,627 --> 01:01:49,179
to the 35 provinces of China.

1003
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,680
When her journey ended
and the new leaders were informed...

1004
01:01:52,867 --> 01:01:55,966
the woman would be beheaded
and buried forever.

1005
01:01:56,136 --> 01:01:58,470
No records, no witnesses.

1006
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:00,263
What type of tradition is that?

1007
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:02,477
Have these guys ever heard of
a damn fax machine?

1008
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,359
Kenji made me do it,
said it was a great honor.

1009
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:08,381
I wanted to do it for him.
For the brotherhood.

1010
01:02:08,547 --> 01:02:10,108
Then why did you
send the names to Han?

1011
01:02:10,215 --> 01:02:12,670
Because I thought the World Court
could protect me.

1012
01:02:12,818 --> 01:02:15,502
But now I see... nobody can.

1013
01:02:15,655 --> 01:02:17,924
You are messed up
in some weird shit, lady.

1014
01:02:18,056 --> 01:02:19,878
I mean man.
Whatever the hell you are.

1015
01:02:19,992 --> 01:02:21,334
I'm a woman!

1016
01:02:21,427 --> 01:02:24,624
And they will send a army to kill me.
To protect their way.

1017
01:02:24,796 --> 01:02:26,968
You know what?
We can't fight no army, Lee.

1018
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,172
Who gonna protect me? I mean us?

1019
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,384
I know a place.

1020
01:02:41,013 --> 01:02:43,315
I won't be here
when you come out. I'm sorry.

1021
01:02:43,447 --> 01:02:47,277
My wife says I can't be a spy,
that I have to be home for dinner.

1022
01:02:47,485 --> 01:02:50,649
The truth is I'm a driver.
Nothing more.

1023
01:02:50,824 --> 01:02:52,482
This is my destiny.

1024
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,143
I will never know what it's like
to be an American.

1025
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:58,042
Never know what it feels like
to kill for no reason.

1026
01:02:58,196 --> 01:02:59,886
George, it's OK.

1027
01:03:00,898 --> 01:03:02,491
Thank you.

1028
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,804
Au revoir. And good luck.

1029
01:03:04,935 --> 01:03:07,237
- Au revoir.
- Bye, George.

1030
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,372
Minister Reynard.

1031
01:03:18,749 --> 01:03:19,796
We have it.

1032
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,167
The Shy Shen list?
This is incredible.

1033
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:26,599
Some people said it was a myth.

1034
01:03:26,691 --> 01:03:29,375
Naw, it's no myth.
I've seen it. Felt it.

1035
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:31,283
Kissed it.
But I didn't French kiss it.

1036
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:33,305
You do understand
how dangerous this is?

1037
01:03:33,431 --> 01:03:34,805
I was gonna use protection.

1038
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,621
Can we go to the police?

1039
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:39,351
The triads control
too many of them here.

1040
01:03:39,506 --> 01:03:41,743
We have to get you
out of the country.

1041
01:03:42,842 --> 01:03:44,119
Now, my dear...

1042
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:47,954
would you mind taking off that wig
and showing us Shy Shen?

1043
01:03:48,147 --> 01:03:50,001
We never told him she was the list.

1044
01:03:55,722 --> 01:04:01,123
Look at that. 13 names linked
to centuries of tradition.

1045
01:04:01,395 --> 01:04:04,428
The only real proof
that their secret world exists.

1046
01:04:12,004 --> 01:04:13,630
Ugh!

1047
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,399
Genevieve, get their guns.

1048
01:04:25,117 --> 01:04:27,004
I told you he was bad.
Didn't I tell you?

1049
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,777
No.

1050
01:04:28,887 --> 01:04:29,966
Well, I was thinkin' it.

1051
01:04:30,055 --> 01:04:31,364
The explosion at the embassy.

1052
01:04:31,456 --> 01:04:33,114
As head of
the World Criminal Court...

1053
01:04:33,225 --> 01:04:35,330
it would make sense
for me to be a target.

1054
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:36,920
Why did you come to my room?

1055
01:04:37,027 --> 01:04:39,166
Genevieve was going to be killed.

1056
01:04:39,296 --> 01:04:43,453
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

1057
01:04:43,668 --> 01:04:45,839
Now, it will end another way.

1058
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:49,002
Ha ha. It's over, Reynard.

1059
01:04:49,173 --> 01:04:51,563
You know what it's like
for old men in prison?

1060
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:54,643
They call you "pops."
They make you work in the library.

1061
01:04:54,813 --> 01:04:57,082
Your best friend? Gonna be a mouse.

1062
01:04:58,983 --> 01:05:02,017
I'm not going to prison.

1063
01:05:02,188 --> 01:05:04,327
You have a phone call, Inspector.

1064
01:05:10,528 --> 01:05:12,633
Hello, brother.

1065
01:05:12,763 --> 01:05:14,422
I'd like to make a trade.

1066
01:05:14,532 --> 01:05:18,274
Some friends of mine came across
something in Los Angeles.

1067
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:20,803
Something very valuable.

1068
01:05:21,905 --> 01:05:23,466
Lee.

1069
01:05:23,573 --> 01:05:25,548
Help me, please.

1070
01:05:28,645 --> 01:05:30,238
Do we understand each other?

1071
01:05:30,346 --> 01:05:31,425
What do you want?

1072
01:05:31,514 --> 01:05:33,173
Shy Shen.

1073
01:05:33,282 --> 01:05:36,032
You and Genevieve
will meet me alone tonight.

1074
01:05:36,184 --> 01:05:40,494
If I see your partner
or any other cops, the girl dies.

1075
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:42,736
Where?

1076
01:05:42,825 --> 01:05:47,811
Jules Verne restaurant, midnight.
Don't be late.

1077
01:06:57,498 --> 01:06:59,986
Welcome to the party, Lee.

1078
01:07:01,236 --> 01:07:03,657
Tonight we celebrate
the return of Shy Shen...

1079
01:07:03,805 --> 01:07:06,653
and the return of my brother.

1080
01:07:06,807 --> 01:07:08,400
Where is Soo Yung?

1081
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:17,662
Ungh.

1082
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:26,920
This sword has a past.

1083
01:07:27,027 --> 01:07:30,605
And like ours, it has seen
much pain, much blood.

1084
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:32,391
Urgh!

1085
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:38,147
Hundreds of years ago
the triads would kill their enemies...

1086
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:40,575
with 100 cuts to the body.

1087
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:44,089
They would be very careful to avoid
any major arteries...

1088
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:47,823
so that the victim would stay alive
for as long as possible.

1089
01:07:49,248 --> 01:07:52,631
You have just experienced
your first cut.

1090
01:07:53,786 --> 01:07:55,925
If anything happens to Soo Yung...

1091
01:07:57,488 --> 01:08:00,969
You could never kill me, Lee.
We both know that.

1092
01:08:01,158 --> 01:08:03,165
You know nothing about me.

1093
01:08:03,293 --> 01:08:07,766
I know you have no wife,
no children, no family.

1094
01:08:07,998 --> 01:08:11,195
Your life ended when we were kids,
back in Chenzhou.

1095
01:08:16,741 --> 01:08:19,675
You have nothing. Just like me.

1096
01:08:20,911 --> 01:08:22,766
I wouldn't say nothin'!

1097
01:08:27,285 --> 01:08:29,619
He has me.

1098
01:08:29,753 --> 01:08:31,892
His brother from another mother.

1099
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:39,868
Where is she?

1100
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:41,652
Enjoying the view.

1101
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:46,611
Soo Yung!

1102
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:48,262
Lee!

1103
01:08:49,905 --> 01:08:51,400
Help.

1104
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:54,918
Let her go.

1105
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:56,472
What the hell is wrong with you?

1106
01:08:56,578 --> 01:08:58,073
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

1107
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,739
Get her in here!

1108
01:09:00,748 --> 01:09:02,570
Carter, drop the gun.

1109
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,058
Get her off that damn rope,
or I'm shootin' you...

1110
01:09:04,152 --> 01:09:05,745
and the damn Temptations.

1111
01:09:05,853 --> 01:09:06,934
Right now!

1112
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:10,767
Oh, no! Lee!

1113
01:09:12,428 --> 01:09:13,738
Lee.

1114
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:15,454
- Do it!
- Put her down!

1115
01:09:15,564 --> 01:09:17,091
I'm serious!

1116
01:09:18,266 --> 01:09:19,608
I'm not playin'!

1117
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:22,122
You ain't my damn brother.

1118
01:09:22,269 --> 01:09:23,350
Kenji.

1119
01:09:23,438 --> 01:09:25,325
- Drop the gun.
- No.

1120
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,488
Drop it, Carter.

1121
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:29,006
Shit.

1122
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:30,703
Damn it.

1123
01:09:35,049 --> 01:09:36,936
- Tonight I lose a brother.
- Aah!

1124
01:09:44,724 --> 01:09:46,185
Get him, Lee!

1125
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:49,854
Gonna get your ass kicked, Kenji.

1126
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:04,500
Come on, kill him already!

1127
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:14,903
Lee, he might be your brother,
but turn him into your sister.

1128
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:32,720
Watch out!

1129
01:10:37,678 --> 01:10:39,239
Yeah!

1130
01:10:39,346 --> 01:10:41,004
Bring your little ass here.
Come here.

1131
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:45,859
Aaaargh.

1132
01:10:45,987 --> 01:10:47,263
Give me your hand.

1133
01:10:52,126 --> 01:10:53,555
Nnngh!

1134
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:58,632
Ah!

1135
01:11:00,635 --> 01:11:02,457
- Grrrah!
- Aaaah!

1136
01:11:03,705 --> 01:11:06,323
Lee? Lee!

1137
01:11:06,473 --> 01:11:08,579
- Gnn!
- Hold on, I'm comin'!

1138
01:11:16,482 --> 01:11:17,911
Get the hell off me.

1139
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,568
Oh.

1140
01:11:36,368 --> 01:11:37,961
Yeah, Lee!

1141
01:11:38,937 --> 01:11:40,628
Whoo!

1142
01:11:41,774 --> 01:11:42,919
Whoa!

1143
01:12:20,444 --> 01:12:22,451
Yaaaaah!

1144
01:12:28,854 --> 01:12:30,381
Ah! Ahhhh!

1145
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:32,823
Ahh... ah...

1146
01:12:32,959 --> 01:12:34,715
Ahhhh! God da...

1147
01:13:08,056 --> 01:13:09,398
Enough, Kenji!

1148
01:13:09,492 --> 01:13:11,085
Grrrargh!

1149
01:13:18,968 --> 01:13:21,303
Aaaaah!

1150
01:13:29,181 --> 01:13:31,668
Rrrraaaargh!

1151
01:13:40,089 --> 01:13:41,398
Rrrraargh!

1152
01:13:42,691 --> 01:13:44,863
Hoh hoh hoh hoh
hoh hoh hoh!

1153
01:13:46,295 --> 01:13:50,005
# Everybody was
kung-fu fightin' #

1154
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:52,404
# The man was fast as ligh...  #

1155
01:13:52,534 --> 01:13:54,127
Soo Yung!

1156
01:13:57,872 --> 01:13:59,531
Aaaaah!

1157
01:14:06,849 --> 01:14:09,238
What are you waiting for? Do it!

1158
01:14:13,255 --> 01:14:14,466
Ah!

1159
01:14:16,257 --> 01:14:17,785
Ungh!

1160
01:14:22,563 --> 01:14:24,156
Let go.

1161
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:25,640
Or we're both gonna die.

1162
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:27,293
No! I can save you.

1163
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,212
Ungh. Grrn.

1164
01:14:34,509 --> 01:14:35,785
Guh.

1165
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,522
Goodbye, Lee.

1166
01:14:38,611 --> 01:14:39,822
No, Kenji!

1167
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,424
No!

1168
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:51,769
Aaah!

1169
01:14:55,794 --> 01:14:57,354
Ah...

1170
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:03,595
Gah!

1171
01:15:04,503 --> 01:15:05,616
Unh.

1172
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:10,292
Aaaah!

1173
01:15:15,881 --> 01:15:17,670
I'm comin', Soo Yung!

1174
01:15:22,588 --> 01:15:24,529
Oh, my God!

1175
01:15:25,757 --> 01:15:28,145
What the hell am I doin' up here?

1176
01:15:29,594 --> 01:15:31,284
Aah! Help.

1177
01:15:34,431 --> 01:15:36,765
Stay cool, lady.
This doesn't have to end this way.

1178
01:15:38,268 --> 01:15:40,821
Don't do it. Don't do it, lady.

1179
01:15:40,972 --> 01:15:42,663
Don't you do it!

1180
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:45,002
Think about what you doin'.

1181
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:46,537
Please.

1182
01:15:46,644 --> 01:15:48,335
Please. No.

1183
01:15:48,446 --> 01:15:49,972
Hey. Hey!

1184
01:15:51,081 --> 01:15:53,384
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

1185
01:15:53,517 --> 01:15:55,339
No.

1186
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:58,664
Please.

1187
01:15:58,756 --> 01:16:01,211
Aaah! Oh, no! No!

1188
01:16:01,358 --> 01:16:03,147
No!

1189
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,721
Aaaah!

1190
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:05,878
Ah!

1191
01:16:05,967 --> 01:16:07,821
Aaah!

1192
01:16:07,933 --> 01:16:09,722
Ah! Aaah!

1193
01:16:09,835 --> 01:16:11,330
Ah! Aaaaaaah!

1194
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:12,714
Oh! Oh.

1195
01:16:12,805 --> 01:16:13,754
Oh.

1196
01:16:27,517 --> 01:16:29,045
Huh!

1197
01:16:29,755 --> 01:16:32,210
Uh! Uh!

1198
01:16:32,356 --> 01:16:34,364
Uh!

1199
01:16:38,562 --> 01:16:41,082
Lee! You shoulda seen us, man.
We whupped their ass.

1200
01:16:41,232 --> 01:16:43,370
Soo Yung!

1201
01:16:43,499 --> 01:16:45,093
I'm OK.

1202
01:16:47,237 --> 01:16:48,284
Oh, shit!

1203
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,547
Call the police.

1204
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:27,757
Ungh!

1205
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,729
Ohhhhh!

1206
01:17:47,631 --> 01:17:48,775
Ah... yah!

1207
01:17:48,862 --> 01:17:50,139
Yeah!

1208
01:17:50,231 --> 01:17:51,441
Whoa! Whoa!

1209
01:17:51,532 --> 01:17:53,605
Whoa-oa! Whoa!

1210
01:17:53,736 --> 01:17:55,361
Rah! Hah! Carter!

1211
01:17:55,469 --> 01:17:56,876
- Hold on!
- Aaah!

1212
01:17:57,572 --> 01:18:00,092
Ah! Yaaaaah!

1213
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:01,614
- Aaaaah!
- Aaah!

1214
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,301
Gnn.

1215
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:04,393
Ah! Oh!

1216
01:18:04,478 --> 01:18:06,518
- Hang on!
- Lee! Reel me in.

1217
01:18:06,646 --> 01:18:08,915
- I got you!
- Black people don't fly.

1218
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,678
Get me up. Get me up.

1219
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,727
Come on, man. Hurry up.

1220
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,066
Ungh.

1221
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:17,003
Oh! Lee! Get me outta here!

1222
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:20,159
Ungh. Argh. Ah.

1223
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:21,408
Don't let go of that flag!

1224
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,121
- Argh.
- Ah!

1225
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:25,239
Ungh.

1226
01:18:25,365 --> 01:18:26,641
Ah!

1227
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:28,840
- Ah.
- Thank you, Lee.

1228
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,836
Carter! Hold on to the flag!

1229
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:37,374
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1230
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,519
- Aaaaah!
- Aaaaah!

1231
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:44,179
- Aaaaaah!

1232
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:45,813
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

1233
01:18:45,919 --> 01:18:46,934
Aaaah!

1234
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:48,996
Aaaaaaaah!

1235
01:18:56,429 --> 01:19:00,106
Lee, I'm gonna kill you
if we don't die!

1236
01:19:02,169 --> 01:19:04,887
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

1237
01:19:05,038 --> 01:19:08,202
Oh, dear Lord, please!
Baby Jesus, help us!

1238
01:19:10,143 --> 01:19:13,853
- Aaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaah!

1239
01:19:15,882 --> 01:19:17,889
Lee! Where you at?

1240
01:19:18,017 --> 01:19:20,286
I'm drownin'! I'm drownin'!

1241
01:19:20,419 --> 01:19:22,808
Get this thing off me, Lee!

1242
01:19:27,394 --> 01:19:28,889
- Carter.
- What?

1243
01:19:28,996 --> 01:19:31,679
I'm not constipated anymore.

1244
01:19:41,207 --> 01:19:43,215
Put your hands up.

1245
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:44,420
Genevieve.

1246
01:19:44,509 --> 01:19:46,648
Hey, man, you're the head
of the World Court.

1247
01:19:46,778 --> 01:19:48,917
What you gonna do,
shoot us down like animals?

1248
01:19:49,047 --> 01:19:50,324
We're police officers.

1249
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:53,166
Yes. And you two
just killed this girl.

1250
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:54,660
Blew her brains out.

1251
01:19:56,722 --> 01:19:57,900
- Carter!
- Don't do it!

1252
01:20:20,413 --> 01:20:21,787
Carter.

1253
01:20:21,881 --> 01:20:24,302
- You all right?
- Put the gun down.

1254
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,141
I followed you.

1255
01:20:28,186 --> 01:20:30,357
Case closed.

1256
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:38,988
Good job, man.

1257
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:51,566
Hey, man! You touch me again...

1258
01:20:51,676 --> 01:20:53,171
you gonna owe me
dinner and a movie.

1259
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:54,358
Congratulations.

1260
01:20:54,444 --> 01:20:57,412
It appears we have finally
brought down the triads.

1261
01:20:57,579 --> 01:20:59,237
- We?!
- You didn't do shit.

1262
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:00,626
My butt still hurts.

1263
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:03,146
The Americans and the French...

1264
01:21:03,253 --> 01:21:05,774
need to work together
in the spirit of brotherhood.

1265
01:21:05,922 --> 01:21:07,777
Together, we can do anything.

1266
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:09,451
Anything! Ha ha ha.

1267
01:21:09,559 --> 01:21:11,566
He's right, Lee.
Together, we can do anything.

1268
01:21:11,693 --> 01:21:12,676
You go this way...

1269
01:21:12,762 --> 01:21:14,224
And I'll go that way.

1270
01:21:17,668 --> 01:21:18,594
# War #

1271
01:21:18,668 --> 01:21:20,708
# Huh, yeah #

1272
01:21:20,836 --> 01:21:22,723
# What is it good for? #

1273
01:21:22,838 --> 01:21:24,333
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1274
01:21:24,438 --> 01:21:26,195
# Uh-huh #

1275
01:21:26,307 --> 01:21:27,235
# War #

1276
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:29,132
# Huh, yeah #

1277
01:21:29,245 --> 01:21:31,416
# What is it good for? #

1278
01:21:31,546 --> 01:21:33,072
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1279
01:21:33,182 --> 01:21:34,676
# Say it again, y'all #

1280
01:21:34,783 --> 01:21:35,711
# War #

1281
01:21:35,785 --> 01:21:37,924
# Huh, look out #

1282
01:21:38,054 --> 01:21:39,995
# What is it good for? #

1283
01:21:40,123 --> 01:21:41,530
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1284
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:42,551
# Listen to me #

1285
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:43,869
# Ohhhh, war! #

1286
01:21:45,394 --> 01:21:47,052
That's right, Lee.
For the last 3 years...

1287
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:49,105
I've studied the ancient teaching
of booty. Ev...

1288
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,205
Oh, booty. Ha ha ha ha!

1289
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:52,740
Cheese!

1290
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,427
- Ha ha ha!
- "Cheese"?

1291
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:56,804
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- What?

1292
01:21:56,939 --> 01:21:59,077
- Freeze.
- Oh, freeze!

1293
01:22:00,107 --> 01:22:02,529
As soon as she could blink,
the s... seafood service...

1294
01:22:02,678 --> 01:22:04,434
- Seaf... seafood...
- Secret Service.

1295
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:05,789
As soon as sh... she could blink...

1296
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,734
the sheafood shervish...
Uh, swa...

1297
01:22:07,849 --> 01:22:08,961
Secret Service.

1298
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,417
The ssssseaf...

1299
01:22:11,553 --> 01:22:13,244
Secret, not seafood.

1300
01:22:13,353 --> 01:22:14,694
I know seafood.

1301
01:22:14,789 --> 01:22:16,033
- I know secret.
- Secret.

1302
01:22:16,123 --> 01:22:17,650
- Secret.
- Secret. See?

1303
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,509
But when everything together,
it become a seafood!

1304
01:22:20,665 --> 01:22:22,671
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

1305
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,490
Action!

1306
01:22:24,599 --> 01:22:26,770
- I'm sorry! So sorry.
- It came off.

1307
01:22:26,903 --> 01:22:28,245
Action!

1308
01:22:28,338 --> 01:22:29,832
- Oh, shit. You all right?
- Yeah, good.

1309
01:22:29,938 --> 01:22:32,556
That was my... Muhammad Ali swing, man!

1310
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:34,431
Yeah, baby!

1311
01:22:37,011 --> 01:22:38,026
Ooh.

1312
01:22:38,113 --> 01:22:40,022
- Oh.
- Whoa.

1313
01:22:40,148 --> 01:22:41,806
- That's the one, Mama.
- That would have been it.

1314
01:22:41,918 --> 01:22:42,997
I'm sick of you, Kenji.

1315
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:46,346
You been tryin' to kill us
ever since the start of this damn movie.

1316
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:49,499
- Raaaaah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1317
01:22:49,623 --> 01:22:51,118
Ah!

1318
01:22:51,894 --> 01:22:52,974

01:22:55,598 --> 01:22:56,743
Action.

1321
01:22:57,632 --> 01:22:58,680
Action.

1322
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:00,043
Ooph!

1323
01:23:00,135 --> 01:23:01,412
You OK?

1324
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,059
So her eye is a little
droopy now and she's...

1325
01:23:05,207 --> 01:23:07,150
So she's working for
El Loc... Lar El Poco.

1326
01:23:07,275 --> 01:23:08,518

- I'm sorry.

1327
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:09,918
It's El Pollo Loco.

01:23:10,013 --> 01:23:12,631
So sh... now she works at
El Lolo Poco.

1329
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:13,926
El Pollo Loco.

1330
01:23:14,015 --> 01:23:16,055
El Lo... Loro Poco. Uh.

1331
01:23:16,184 --> 01:23:17,263
El Poco Loco.

1332
01:23:17,351 --> 01:23:18,432

01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:31,608
El Pollo Loco.

01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:33,454

1342
01:23:42,942 --> 01:23:44,218
The mom's gone.

1343
01:23:45,445 --> 01:23:46,972
Maybe we should
put on a dirty movie.

1344
01:23:47,081 --> 01:23:48,357
Lee!

1345
01:23:48,448 --> 01:23:50,456
- I like the ones with a story.
- What?

1346
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:52,853
- I like the one with a locker-room scene.
- What?

1347
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,415
I like the one with a prison scene.

1348
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,830
I like the one with a shower scene.

1349
01:23:55,922 --> 01:23:57,329
I like the ones with a white girl.

1350
01:23:57,424 --> 01:23:58,766
I'm into feet.

1351
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:00,484
I like the one with the horses.

1352
01:24:00,593 --> 01:24:02,186
- What's that mean?
- Damn.

1353
01:24:02,294 --> 01:24:03,439
What he teach me?

1354
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:04,676
That's it, one more, one more.
Last one.

1355
01:24:04,764 --> 01:24:06,105
Are you teaching me a bad word?

1356
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:07,660
I like the one with hairy woman.

1357
01:24:07,766 --> 01:24:08,845
What's wrong with you?

1358
01:24:08,935 --> 01:24:10,047
I don't know. Brett Ratner tell...

1359
01:24:10,135 --> 01:24:12,023
- teach me that.
- He'll teach you anything.

1360
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:13,729
And you're not my brother.

1361
01:24:13,839 --> 01:24:16,589
I'm not your brother?

1362
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:18,651
All the stuff we've been through?

1363
01:24:20,278 --> 01:24:21,872
Rush Hour 1, Rush Hour 2?
