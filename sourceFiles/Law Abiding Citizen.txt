1
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:46,615
''B.''

2
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,990
''A.''

3
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,900
You having fun, sweetheart?

4
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,090
Yes.

5
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:56,850
Ahh.

6
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:59,885
Well, I hope you're doing
better than me, baby.

7
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:02,455
- What are you making?
- A necklace for Mom.

8
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,700
Yeah? Let me see.

9
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:07,088
Wow. Another one?

10
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,704
- Yes.
honey?

11
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:11,524
That's two today.

12
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:13,427
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:15,009
honey?

14
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,788
- Yeah?
- Waiting for the help to get that?

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,719
I thought you and I were the help.

16
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:25,800
- Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin.
- Okay.

17
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,431
Mmm, smells nice.
That takeout?

18
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:31,984
Mommy, look at-

19
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:41,866
No!

20
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,387
No! Ahh!

21
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:52,050
Oh! No no no!

22
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:54,666
You can't fight fate.

23
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:09,283
We gotta get the fuck out of here.
Come on!

24
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:13,893
Oh! Oh no!

25
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:19,331
No!

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,205
- What the fuck are you doing?
- No!

27
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:24,650
Fucking stop!
Let's go!

28
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:26,850
Just shut the fuck up!

29
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,164
No!

30
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:45,695
It's cool.

31
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,336
Kids like me.

32
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,540
No! heather!

33
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:56,057
No no!

34
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:54,717
- Nick.
- Bray, what's happenin'?

35
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:58,126
Willis is a rowing buddy of mine.
Where are we on his kid's case?

36
00:03:58,327 --> 00:03:59,715
- Willis?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,630
- Oh, I kicked it down to juvie.
- Why did you do that?

38
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:03,719
'Cause the case was a dog.
The kid was only 15 years old

39
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,497
when he committed the murder.

40
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,531
You wouldn't want to jeopardize
your 95% conviction rate.

41
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:10,635
- It's actually 96%.
- 96% now?

42
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,161
Yes. You gotta keep your books
better than that.

43
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:17,699
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were gunning for my job.

44
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,310
You do know better.

45
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:21,836
And you know that I'm aiming
much higher than that.

46
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,535
They filed a motion to dismiss,

47
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,515
but there's no way that
Judge Abrams honors it.

48
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:27,914
I think that we can
get him on RICO.

49
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:30,587
All that time and that's
what you come back with, Sarah?

50
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:33,597
You might want to reevaluate
your research skills.

51
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,565
- What else have we got?
- She's right.

52
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:36,861
Mr. Rice?

53
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:38,496
RICO's designed
for this kind of thing.

54
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,090
Check out section 901 of
the Organized Crime Control Act.

55
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,471
And you should let Sarah
try this case too.

56
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:46,656
Mr. Rice, last I checked,
l was running this room.

57
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,155
She's already done the leg-work.
I'll oversee it.

58
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:51,089
I mean, Helen Keller
could try this case.

59
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,844
Okay, Boy Wonder,
she fucks up, it's on you.

60
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,927
Cantrell wants to see you.

61
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:05,394
All right, I'll be right there.

62
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:09,084
No, Nick.
he wants to see Nick.

63
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,168
Let's just say I'm less impressed
with his Harvard degree than he is.

64
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:15,647
Well, we can't all have
gone to Fordham.

65
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,080
I went to Fordham night school.

66
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:19,465
You know what I learned
in Fordham night school?

67
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:20,909
Law school's got nothing
to do with law.

68
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:23,336
Guess you skipped the course
on inter-office politics.

69
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:26,256
All I need is a jury to like me.
Isn't that what you told me, Jonas?

70
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:29,312
The Shelton case-
where are we?

71
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:31,185
It went sideways last night-
Judge Burch.

72
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,732
Ahh.

73
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,674
Bad news. What now?

74
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:37,567
- Let's make the deal.
- They killed a little girl, Nick.

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,615
- It's an imperfect system.
- And we its imperfect servants.

76
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:44,354
- however you could win this case.
- No, can't take that chance.

77
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:47,140
Some justice is better
than no justice at all.

78
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:49,344
You need to tell the husband.

79
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:51,706
Okay.
That's part of my job.

80
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,823
Good, because he's waiting
for you right now.

81
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:56,642
What?

82
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:08,851
- how are you doing?
- Good. how are you doing?

83
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,589
Good. Sit. Sit.

84
00:06:11,794 --> 00:06:14,274
Well, I didn't hear back from you

85
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:17,614
and made some notes
on the case.

86
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,689
I had some good ideas.

87
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:22,535
Yeah, let me
take a look at it.

88
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,892
Well, they're just-

89
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:33,521
I was gonna talk to you
about those.

90
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,922
Do you trust me?

91
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,964
Do you trust me, Clyde?

92
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:44,709
Yeah, of course.

93
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:50,598
Darby has agreed to testify
against Ames.

94
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,339
With Darby's testimony,

95
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,296
Ames will go
to death row.

96
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:03,319
Um, what about-
what about Darby then?

97
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:06,993
Darby will plead
guilty to murder.

98
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:09,834
- In what degree?
- Third.

99
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:12,442
he serves, what?
Five years...

100
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:15,194
at best?

101
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,254
I don't understand.
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:22,266
We had a setback. The judge ruled
that the DNA was inadmissible.

103
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:25,372
- What?
- Exclusionary rule.

104
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,362
The opposing counsel
maneuvered it.

105
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:29,728
You said this part of
the case was clear-cut.

106
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:31,370
We had the blood on his shirt-

107
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,197
It's covered under
the same rule.

108
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,736
What about the rest of
the forensic evidence?

109
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,503
It's not conclusive, Clyde.

110
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:44,098
Okay, that's okay.
'Cause I saw- I saw their faces.

111
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:47,318
I saw them do it.
l mean, he killed my little girl, Nick.

112
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:50,370
You blacked out, Clyde.
Your testimony won't be reliable.

113
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:53,278
You get on the stand and
the defense will tear you apart.

114
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,868
No no, the jury's gonna
believe me though.

115
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:59,148
- Because it's the truth! We can-
- We can lose.

116
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,079
And then we'd have nothing.

117
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,634
You will waste a whole year,
spend millions of dollars,

118
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,711
and then both of them could
end up going free.

119
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,424
Nick, both of them are guilty,
especially Darby!

120
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:12,612
- You know that.
- It's not what you know, Clyde.

121
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,179
It's what you can
prove in court.

122
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,443
Please don't make a deal
with this man.

123
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:23,645
Please don't make a deal with this man.
he's a monster-

124
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:26,322
I'm sorry, the deal is done.
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:28,298
I made the deal.

126
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:31,438
What?
how could you do that?

127
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:35,191
This is just how
the justice system works.

128
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:39,446
Listen, I know you don't
think it right now,

129
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,369
but this is a victory for us.

130
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:48,280
Your office has certified
this agreement?

131
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:49,709
Yes, Your honor.

132
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,767
Mr. Reynolds, any great insights
to share with the court today?

133
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,948
I'm a defense attorney, Your honor.
l don't have many of those.

134
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:03,181
No, Your honor.
No insights.

135
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:06,135
Good, then I trust that we can
move forward with Mr. Ames's trial

136
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:09,824
unimpeded by continuances.
A trial date is imminent.

137
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:14,761
Yeah?

138
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:17,332
There's no cell phones
in my courtroom, Mr. Rice.

139
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,840
- We've been over this-
- I'm sorry.

140
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:20,103
- and over this, over this...

141
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:22,967
Yeah, I had some
exigent business l-

142
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:25,074
Next time it's mine.

143
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:31,767
- Ah, you married?
- Excuse me?

144
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:33,943
Are you married?

145
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:39,055
Please fuck this up
so I can destroy you.

146
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:46,884
I wish ill for no man,

147
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:50,744
but Ames deserves to
suffer for what he did.

148
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:54,080
I mean, you can't
fight fate, right?

149
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:01,288
Nick.

150
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:04,030
Once you make a decision,
live with it- move on.

151
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:06,384
This job, your best asset's
a short memory.

152
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,585
Don't beat yourself up. Too many other
people out there doing that already.

153
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:10,999
Look, there's some of them
right now.

154
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,124
Isn't this where you tell me
some type of old fable

155
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:17,081
or wives' tale-

156
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,075
All right, all right, I got one.

157
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,179
Marcus Aurelius hired a servant
to walk behind him

158
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:22,924
as he made his way through
the Roman town square.

159
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,176
And this servant's only job

160
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:28,032
was to whisper in his ear
when people praised him,

161
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:31,471
''You're only a man.
You're only a man. ''

162
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,067
- Okay, man?
- Okay, man.

163
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,480
- Okay, man.
- That's some bullshit.

164
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:35,671
That's good.

165
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:37,100
I don't think you even know
what that story means.

166
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,391
You're missing the point, Nick.
It doesn't matter what they say.

167
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,082
Okay, I got this now.

168
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,868
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
one at a time, one at a time.

169
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:48,787
So you'll be seeking
the death penalty?

170
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,978
- For Rupert Ames, we will be.
- And for Darby?

171
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:53,636
he has pled guilty to murder,
but he is a cooperating witness.

172
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:56,181
The DA's office has committed
all of its resources

173
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,850
to ensure that justice
will be served.

174
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,688
Did you make any kind of-

175
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:02,592
Do you think this is
a fair sentence for Darby?

176
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:09,130
I just wanted to say
thanks for being in my corner.

177
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:12,333
It's nice when
the system works, right?

178
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,593
Get away from me.

179
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:17,126
Move. Move.

180
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,364
Let's go.

181
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:57,310
- Nick?
- hey.

182
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:12,135
Nuh-uh, what happened?

183
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:14,539
What happened to what?

184
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:17,865
What's wrong?

185
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:22,233
You call my job boring. ''C-''?

186
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:23,927
Yes.

187
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,166
Well...
okay now...

188
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:30,232
you gonna tell me
what's wrong?

189
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:33,937
Can I talk to my daughter
for a little bit?

190
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:37,058
- Oh, please. No no no.
- Gonna lay down.

191
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:39,583
Please?

192
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,847
First of all,
this is your father speaking.

193
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,742
- Yeah, she didn't know that.
- You never know.

194
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:46,689
I want you to stay in there
as long as you can.

195
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:49,047
'cause there's a lot
of crazy-ass people out here.

196
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,951
Language.

197
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:54,166
Your mother's a hardass, but-

198
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm right here.

199
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:59,330
And Daddy- Daddy wants you to
come out and be Daddy's little girl.

200
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:02,186
I want her to come out
'cause she's on my bladder.

201
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:04,157
Ahh!

202
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:07,808
Anybody seen my phone?

203
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,513
- hey, have you seen my phone?
- It's not strapped to your hand?

204
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:17,639
No, it's not strapped to my hand.

205
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:19,528
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

206
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:21,143
You're not gonna have
some of my French toast?

207
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:23,066
- French toast? You made French toast?
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:26,122
I can't, honey.
I'm running late.

209
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:27,528
Okay.

210
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:30,778
All right, here- Mmm.

211
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,564
- Mmm, that's good.
- Thank you.

212
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:33,788
- You did this by yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,669
I'm just gonna take
this whole plate to work.

214
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:38,286
All right- no.

215
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,105
You're only 10 years old?

216
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:42,316
- You better than your mother.
- I heard that.

217
00:13:42,494 --> 00:13:45,042
Smells good in here.
Your lifeline.

218
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:47,033
'Morning, baby.
Give me a kiss.

219
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:50,264
Mmm! You going to your daughter's
recital this afternoon?

220
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,133
Um, I thought you were gonna
order the DVDs.

221
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,989
Video's not the same, Nick.

222
00:13:57,175 --> 00:14:00,167
Mom, it's okay.
Dad's got to work, I know.

223
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:03,200
See? It's all right. Dad's got to work.
And what is Dad doing today?

224
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,005
- Lock up bad guys.
- And why does he do that?

225
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:06,544
- To keep us safe.
- Yeah.

226
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:09,616
She understands.
'Cause he wants us to be safe.

227
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,565
- Baby, get your cello.
- All right.

228
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:13,786
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

229
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:16,839
- Little Julia Child.
- Mmm.

230
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:20,544
You know she's
10 years old, right?

231
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:21,958
- You know that?
- I know that.

232
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,672
She doesn't understand why
you're never around.

233
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:25,860
This good-guy, bad-guy stuff-
that's just talk to her.

234
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:27,653
Don't do this, come on.

235
00:14:27,873 --> 00:14:29,556
I can't come today.

236
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,900
You know you have not been
to one recital-

237
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:33,632
- how many has she had?
- Enough.

238
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:36,158
Okay.
Well, we'll get the video,

239
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,424
we'll sit down and we'll
watch it together as a family.

240
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:42,718
I love you.

241
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,181
All right?

242
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,437
- Thank you for the toast.
- Love you.

243
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:47,722
- Love you too!
- Bye.

244
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,823
Love you.

245
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,874
huh.

246
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:54,783
- So how's Chip?
- It's Chester.

247
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:56,336
What happened to Chip?
l liked Chip.

248
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:58,107
There is no Chip.

249
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,675
And now there's no Chester.
he kept calling.

250
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,185
- Sarah, that's a good thing.
- I know, but I kept canceling.

251
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,153
My caseload's crazy.

252
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:08,020
You know you don't have to
go to this if you don't want to.

253
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:10,719
Yeah, I do. l...

254
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,304
What's it like?

255
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,753
No biggie.
Like watching somebody fall asleep.

256
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,953
Except for
the not-waking-up part.

257
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,950
Does it bother you?

258
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:20,679
Not anymore.

259
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:09,797
Sarah, your legs are looking
real good in those heels.

260
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:13,024
Fuck off.

261
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,810
What are you doing here, Reynolds?
Your DVD player broken?

262
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:19,413
Ames has no family. I felt like
someone should be here for him.

263
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,998
Wow, that's nice.

264
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,173
Breathe.

265
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:47,808
Rupert Ames, do you have
anything you want to say?

266
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,929
Yeah.

267
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,358
Uh-huh.

268
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:58,152
What I did that night was wrong.

269
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:02,095
I should have never been there.

270
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:06,888
But I swear to God,
l didn't kill those people.

271
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:13,474
The wrong man's dying here today.

272
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,749
The wrong man's dying.

273
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:22,009
That's all.

274
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:48,501
Look at me.

275
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:51,830
Look at me!

276
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:55,728
Ahh! Fuck!

277
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,300
Fuck!

278
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:02,469
Ahh! Fuck!

279
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,228
Oh, God.

280
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,735
- Oh, God.
- Take her- take her out.

281
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:10,128
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

282
00:19:12,157 --> 00:19:15,411
Ahhh!

283
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:43,768
What could have caused
the unexpected reaction of the inmate?

284
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,971
We'll keep you informed.

285
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:48,367
You okay? huh?

286
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,217
Yeah.

287
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:54,161
So somebody killed the guy
you were trying to kill?

288
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:55,583
What are we calling this?

289
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:57,365
Clear violation of his
Eighth Amendment rights-

290
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,329
- cruel and unusual punishment.
- Law school.

291
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:01,721
Yeah. The machine-
how does it work on a good day?

292
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:04,065
It's designed to be pain-free.

293
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:06,765
It's three drugs administered
in a specific order.

294
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:09,112
From this point on, we're operating
under the assumption

295
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:10,685
that the machine was corrupted.

296
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:13,771
We're gonna need a list of all
the people with access to that machine.

297
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:16,517
- My people would not do this.
- I appreciate that, Warden,

298
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:20,077
but I'm gonna need more than
a hall pass and a note from Mom.

299
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,280
Detectives, got this off
the back of the machine.

300
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:24,695
- Check it out.
- Let me see it.

301
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:26,818
Right there.

302
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:28,809
''Can't fight fate. ''

303
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,674
What is it, Nick?

304
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,078
During the home invasion,
Ames's accomplice

305
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,430
said to one of the vics,
''You can't fight fate. ''

306
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:38,869
And then he said the same thing
to me in the courtroom- prick.

307
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:41,765
I can't remember his name, though.

308
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:44,469
have a look at this-
your guy?

309
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,850
Clarence James Darby.
he's a cutie.

310
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:48,931
- You got history with him?
- Put him away.

311
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:53,520
There was extenuating
circumstances.

312
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:56,971
The only extenuating circumstances
should be he didn't do it.

313
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:59,863
Still, three years at Marion?
Fucking gladiator academy.

314
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,808
You expect him to come back
a model citizen?

315
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:04,406
Well, if you scholars wouldn't
contaminate the crime scenes,

316
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:05,955
I could keep them
locked up longer.

317
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:08,159
Authorities have refused
to comment at this point,

318
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:10,278
but foul play cannot be ruled out.

319
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:12,997
The prisoner had been on death row
for the past 10 years-

320
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:14,616
his name, Rupert Ames.

321
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:16,174
All we know at this point

322
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:18,616
is what was supposed to be
a painless execution

323
00:21:18,825 --> 00:21:21,578
has turned into something
out of a horror film.

324
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,892
Yeah?

325
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:32,134
- Clarence Darby?
- Who's this?

326
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:35,331
coke on the table,

327
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:38,056
bitch on the floor- life in prison.

328
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:41,685
Who the fuck is this?

329
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,575
Look out your window,
south side.

330
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:48,700
- ls this a joke? Get up!
- Ahh!

331
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:51,115
South side.

332
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,924
Motherfucker.

333
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:59,866
Shit. Out of the way!

334
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,104
- Stay down!
- You're all crazy!

335
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:17,016
he's heading north!
Go go!

336
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:19,970
- Damn.
- Move it, move it. Go on!

337
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:30,879
- What now?
- Wipe the prints off the gun.

338
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:33,146
- Get rid of it.
- No no.

339
00:22:33,358 --> 00:22:37,044
You fired six times, genius.
You bring any ammunition?

340
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:38,920
- Lose it.
- Why are you doing this?

341
00:22:39,114 --> 00:22:40,729
I want to keep you
out of prison.

342
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:43,668
See the abandoned factories?
Go toward them.

343
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:44,857
Why?

344
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:46,788
There's a cop car there
with a cop in it.

345
00:22:46,996 --> 00:22:48,145
What the fuck?

346
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:50,913
I Tasered him, but he'll be waking up
in about 90 seconds,

347
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,912
so you'd better move.

348
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:14,077
Rise and fucking shine, bitch.
Wake the fuck up!

349
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:16,060
Let's go!
Start the fucking car!

350
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:17,322
- Okay!
- Do it.

351
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:19,779
- Take it easy, take it-
- Come on!

352
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:21,603
- Okay, let's go.
- Take it easy.

353
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:24,678
Let's go!
Get in gear, shithead, now!

354
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:27,189
Do it! Go go go!

355
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:44,903
Get the fuck out.

356
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:52,342
Let's go.

357
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,442
Get the fuck down there!

358
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:58,640
Okay. What about my wife?
My little girl?

359
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:02,003
- I'll never see them again.
- Fucked up, ain't it?

360
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:05,052
Oh oh oh.

361
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,630
You don't mind if
l take this, do you?

362
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:10,045
My guardian angel.

363
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:12,032
I am impressed.

364
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:16,264
You know why I'll never see
my wife and little girl again?

365
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:23,221
'Cause you took 'em from me.

366
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:32,609
You remember me?

367
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:36,200
Sure you do.

368
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:39,082
You came over to my house
once before.

369
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:41,288
You don't remember?

370
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:47,663
This tetrodotoxin...

371
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:51,181
should be nicely into
your system by now.

372
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:55,091
It's isolated from the liver
of a Caribbean puffer fish.

373
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,840
So it paralyzes you,

374
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:02,060
but leaves all the other
neurological functions

375
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:04,111
perfectly intact.

376
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,622
In other words, you can't move...

377
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:11,319
but you feel everything.

378
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:16,817
It does absolutely nothing
to blunt the pain.

379
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:19,774
And you're about to
experience more of that

380
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:22,338
than you could ever
fucking imagine.

381
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,766
These are tourniquets

382
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:38,005
so you don't bleed out,
'cause you may be here a while.

383
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:40,257
Saline solution-

384
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:42,975
that should keep us going.

385
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:47,222
Clamps- nice and secure.

386
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:51,272
Comfortable?

387
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:54,054
You really are shaking.

388
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:56,485
Sure you're all right?

389
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:00,914
You'll love this-

390
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:03,155
adrenaline.

391
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,409
Now this is so you
don't pass out.

392
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:11,182
There you go.

393
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:14,518
how's that feel? Good?

394
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:19,156
Now what we don't want
is you swallowing your tongue,

395
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:21,416
so bear with me.

396
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:31,312
Now this is for your penis,
but we'll get to that later.

397
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:36,195
Scalpel...

398
00:26:36,392 --> 00:26:38,314
for your eyelids,

399
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,340
in case you insist
on fucking shutting them.

400
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:45,553
You see,

401
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:49,387
I know what it feels like
to be helpless.

402
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:52,962
just like when I watched you
slaughter my whole family.

403
00:26:55,286 --> 00:26:59,302
You know you can't
fight fate, right, Darby?

404
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:02,551
Oh!

405
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:07,143
And look-
l made this especially for you.

406
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:13,426
You like it? Yeah,
l didn't want you to miss anything.

407
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:19,106
Now you have the best
view in the house.

408
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,164
You hear that?

409
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:24,539
Your heart is beating so fast.

410
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:28,653
No, me too.

411
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:30,283
Okay.

412
00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:36,373
Now they get to
watch you suffer.

413
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:41,746
They'll be the last thing
you ever see

414
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:45,212
as I cut off every single one
of your fucking limbs.

415
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,674
See, I wasn't lying

416
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:52,567
when I told you that I wanted
to keep you out of prison.

417
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:57,629
That was the truth.

418
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:35,966
Thanks for the car.

419
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:04,237
Okay, these are all
the case files on Darby.

420
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:07,066
I vetted through what I could.
We have crime-scene photos-

421
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:09,037
Don't need to see 'em.

422
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:11,760
Okay.

423
00:29:17,386 --> 00:29:20,241
- What's bothering you?
- It's Darby.

424
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:23,252
All the crimes he's committed
have one thing in common,

425
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:25,584
and that was violence.
But yesterday at that execution,

426
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,761
- that wasn't violence. That was-
- What?

427
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:30,191
- That was intellect.
- Okay.

428
00:29:31,317 --> 00:29:33,535
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

429
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:37,388
I'm just thinking maybe
we shouldn't be looking for Darby.

430
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,097
Jesus Christ.

431
00:30:02,682 --> 00:30:04,400
Rice.

432
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,489
Good news, Counselor. We found Darby.

433
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:10,736
I gotta say though,
he's looked better.

434
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:14,660
They found him in about 25 pieces:

435
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:18,285
no legs, no arms,
eyelids were sliced off- gruesome.

436
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:20,275
- Shedding tears for Darby?
- Not quite.

437
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:23,483
- I see your wheels turning.
- Think motive- who has one?

438
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:26,312
The husband, the father.
What do we know about him?

439
00:30:26,497 --> 00:30:28,215
he owned the warehouse
where they found Darby.

440
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,701
- What else?
- he's a tinkerer-

441
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:33,637
uh, little inventions, gizmos.
he holds two dozen patents

442
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:35,385
that made him some money.

443
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,411
he liquidated most of
his wealth a few years ago

444
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:42,177
to buy some industrial
properties around airports,

445
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:44,242
chemical plants,
rail yards.

446
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:46,912
- It doesn't add up.
- No, it's weird, right?

447
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:48,523
Search 'em all, Sarah.
See what you find.

448
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:07,700
Freeze!

449
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:10,946
- Get down, go!
- On your knees!

450
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:14,726
- Face down, face down!
- Pull him down and cuff him!

451
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:54,076
Crazy men scare
the shit out of me.

452
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,352
ls this guy a lawyer?

453
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:57,986
No.

454
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,777
he's an engineer.

455
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:05,001
Nick, look at this.

456
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:45,112
We have zero evidence.
Gonna need a confession.

457
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,039
he give you any trouble
on the way in?

458
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,422
No, nothing.

459
00:33:48,616 --> 00:33:51,335
he wasn't too happy when
we took his bracelet, though.

460
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:02,816
- Can I help you?
- Package for the Rice family.

461
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:05,894
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

462
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:11,287
Mom, the video from my recital came.
Can we watch it?

463
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:13,986
- Please?
- No, not you.

464
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:16,731
No, please, we said we were
gonna wait for your father, remember?

465
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:18,984
- Please?
- No, not now.

466
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:21,236
Okay.

467
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:24,788
Uh-huh, yes.

468
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,804
Yes, absolutely.

469
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:49,900
Mommy!

470
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,114
Don't worry, he's just disarming
the guy, letting him feel easy.

471
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:13,508
What I'm about to tell you
l don't want anybody else to hear.

472
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,420
As a prosecutor, I'm breaking
all the rules right now,

473
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,305
and I don't give a damn
because I'm a father.

474
00:35:19,498 --> 00:35:21,386
I have a little girl.

475
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:25,304
And what you did... bravo.

476
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:31,480
The world is better
without Darby and Ames.

477
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:36,159
You're not gonna see a tear shed
from me or anybody in my office.

478
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:43,519
With that being said...

479
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:45,915
I have a job to do.

480
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:50,541
I'm gonna ask you some very simple
and direct questions.

481
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:54,595
I suggest that you
answer them in the same fashion.

482
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:56,774
ls your name Clyde Alexander Shelton?

483
00:35:57,786 --> 00:35:58,832
Yes, sir.

484
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:00,756
And you've waived
your right to counsel, correct?

485
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:04,710
- Yes, sir.
- You sure you want to do that?

486
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,102
Yes.

487
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:09,685
Did you murder Clarence Darby?

488
00:36:11,091 --> 00:36:13,639
I wanted him dead.

489
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,459
he killed my wife and child.

490
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,864
Rupert Ames-
did you murder him as well?

491
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,413
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

492
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:25,527
They both deserved to die.

493
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:29,280
So you arranged
both of those murders?

494
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:31,786
Yes, I planned it...

495
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:35,809
in my head, over and over again.
It took me a long time.

496
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,791
All right.

497
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,146
I guess we're done here.

498
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,888
Counselor?

499
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,322
You might want to cancel
your 12:30 lunch with Judge Roberts.

500
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:53,922
Excuse me?

501
00:36:54,134 --> 00:36:56,455
In fact, you might want to
cancel the rest of the week,

502
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:59,322
'cause you're gonna be busy.
Sit down.

503
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:03,697
We're done here.
We have your confession.

504
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:06,215
Mmm. Oh, you do?

505
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:07,944
On tape.

506
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:10,969
See, in our profession,
we consider that a slam-dunk.

507
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:13,870
Oh, really?
l don't think so. Let's think back.

508
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:15,686
What did I say?

509
00:37:15,906 --> 00:37:18,898
That I wanted to kill
Clarence Darby?

510
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:21,397
Yeah, sure.
What father wouldn't?

511
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:24,160
That both Darby and Ames
deserved to die?

512
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:25,954
I think most people
would agree with that.

513
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:29,385
That I planned it over and over
again in my head?

514
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:32,805
Yeah. Who wouldn't
fantasize about that?

515
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:35,692
None of these are
an admission of guilt, Nick.

516
00:37:35,884 --> 00:37:38,569
- You might want to check the tape.
- We know you did it.

517
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:42,084
Well, it's not what you know,
it's what you can prove in court.

518
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:43,688
Didn't you tell me that once?

519
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:45,211
The only problem with your theory

520
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:47,476
is that Darby's body was
found on your property.

521
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:50,839
One of my many properties-
an old abandoned warehouse, Nick.

522
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,914
Junkies, they trespass there
all the time.

523
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:56,159
Isn't Darby involved
in the drug trade?

524
00:37:56,363 --> 00:37:59,048
That's an unsavory world.
l bet you a jury would agree.

525
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:02,256
Or perhaps someone was
trying to frame me.

526
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,136
You know, Clyde,

527
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,379
there's a lot of assholes in prison
that thought they were smarter than me.

528
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:10,097
Let's stop fucking around.

529
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:13,218
Nick, unless you have any
hard evidence,

530
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:15,777
then why are we even here?
Why are we having this-

531
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:18,355
- What do you want?
- -conversation?

532
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,643
Well, that's easy.

533
00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:26,102
Now you're the one who
makes deals with murderers, yeah?

534
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,494
So I've come to make mine.

535
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:33,169
I will give you a confession,
a real confession.

536
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,509
You just have to
give me something in return.

537
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:38,845
Yeah, well, since you
are a murderer, what might that be?

538
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:41,184
A bed.

539
00:38:43,911 --> 00:38:46,129
But a nice bed.

540
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,719
I want a nice new one
for my cell.

541
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,372
Very simple.

542
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:53,098
You're gonna have to deal with that,
because the one I have is lumpy, Nick.

543
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:55,308
It's making me crazy.

544
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:58,054
Clyde, I think you've got me
confused with detail people.

545
00:38:58,258 --> 00:39:00,306
See, I don't deal
with prison conditions.

546
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:02,729
I believe those cots
are bolted into the cells.

547
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,979
Well, that's what wrenches are for,
dumbass.

548
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:09,409
You know, one of those new
Duxiana beds

549
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:12,925
with the adjustable- you know,
adjustable lumbar support,

550
00:39:13,107 --> 00:39:14,392
- that's the one.
- I've seen the commercial.

551
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:15,996
- That's the one I want.
- Those are nice.

552
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:17,979
- 'Cause really-
- Comes on late at night.

553
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:19,810
- And frankly I don't think-
- Two old people laying on the bed.

554
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,418
- I'll be able to focus
on anything

555
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:23,765
until I've had a good
revitalizing night's sleep

556
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:26,169
in my therapeutic Duxiana bed.

557
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,053
So that's the deal:

558
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:31,762
you get me my bed,
you get your confession.

559
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:34,780
Okay, let me think
about that for a second.

560
00:39:34,962 --> 00:39:37,044
how about...

561
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:39,008
fuck no.

562
00:39:49,268 --> 00:39:51,020
hey, what are you doing?

563
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:53,310
- What do you mean?
- Why did you tell him no?

564
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:56,605
A mattress? he doesn't make
those kinds of decisions.

565
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:59,968
Take your ego out of it, Nick. Shelton's
this case is shit.

566
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:02,475
We need a confession.
And a mattress for a murder confession?

567
00:40:02,656 --> 00:40:04,840
- That's a pretty good deal.
- he's playing us, Jonas.

568
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,512
Well, then we will play him.

569
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,249
Nick?

570
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:10,968
There's an urgent call from your office.
They say you're not answering your cell.

571
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:13,986
I need to finish up here and then
l will be home as soon as I can.

572
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:16,056
the things on this video-

573
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:18,835
Nick, I have never seen
anything like it.

574
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:20,366
Please come home.

575
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:24,371
Listen, you need to calm down.
Tell her that it's not real...

576
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:26,168
- Okay.
- ... and that I love her.

577
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:27,400
Come home.
Come home soon, please.

578
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:29,384
- Kelly, did you see his face?
- No.

579
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,648
It was covered with something.
l couldn't see.

580
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:34,844
Okay, baby, let me finish up here and
I'll come home as fast as I can, okay?

581
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:36,876
Okay.

582
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:40,114
This motherfucker sent a DVD to my house
of him killing Darby.

583
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,072
- What?
- My daughter saw it.

584
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:50,041
No no, he had on a mask.
We need that confession.

585
00:40:50,245 --> 00:40:52,327
You still want to bargain
with this man?

586
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:56,373
Make the deal.

587
00:40:58,837 --> 00:41:02,022
hey, come on, man! Give us one!

588
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:17,959
Back problems, Warden-
the worst.

589
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:20,537
You got bigger problems than that.

590
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:23,282
It's the have-nots in here, son.

591
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:27,139
I don't know that I want
to be the one ''have. ''

592
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:32,398
Turn around.

593
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,043
I don't think he likes me.

594
00:41:40,629 --> 00:41:42,415
Nice bed.

595
00:41:44,258 --> 00:41:46,271
Thank you.

596
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:48,948
It's a single.

597
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:53,657
I'd watch my fucking back
around here, you hear?

598
00:41:55,102 --> 00:41:56,455
In the cell, let's go.

599
00:42:00,524 --> 00:42:02,139
We can't put
Clyde Shelton anywhere-

600
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:04,407
not in a job, not in a city,
not even the country.

601
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:07,626
So I dug a little deeper and I found
something from his missing years:

602
00:42:07,823 --> 00:42:11,304
a couple of contract payments to Clyde
from the Department of Defense.

603
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:14,144
- And his real estate?
- he bought nine properties

604
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:16,217
under his own name,
then he transferred them

605
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:17,564
to some corporation in Panama.

606
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:19,603
We can't get to the addresses.

607
00:42:19,793 --> 00:42:21,181
A lack of reciprocity
is our problem.

608
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:22,925
So I'm gonna circle
back to the farmhouse.

609
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,315
That's a waste of time. he wanted us
to find it and find him there.

610
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:28,692
It's the industrial stuff
that's curious.

611
00:42:28,885 --> 00:42:31,365
All right, I don't care what you
have to do and who you have to piss off.

612
00:42:31,555 --> 00:42:34,035
If we have to invade
Panama again, fine.

613
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:36,704
Clyde is hiding those properties
for a reason. Find him.

614
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:38,110
Got it.

615
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,925
- Baby, you leave it cracked?
- hmm? Yeah, I left it cracked.

616
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:55,803
- Night light?
- Isn't she too old for a night light?

617
00:42:55,996 --> 00:42:58,214
Yeah, I left a night light.

618
00:42:58,415 --> 00:43:00,269
- Good.
- Look,

619
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:02,245
I told her that
that video wasn't real.

620
00:43:02,461 --> 00:43:04,679
- Okay.
- It's some sort of horror film-

621
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,336
something she shouldn't
be looking at anyway.

622
00:43:06,548 --> 00:43:08,231
- Okay, good.
- She'll be okay.

623
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:09,881
Yeah. And you?

624
00:43:10,093 --> 00:43:12,982
- Am I what? Okay?
- Yeah.

625
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,193
Of course.
Don't I look okay?

626
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,244
- hmm?
- Yeah.

627
00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:21,783
Nick is always okay.

628
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,562
Always- I'm extra good.

629
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:28,198
I love you.

630
00:43:28,403 --> 00:43:29,791
I love you too.

631
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:38,141
In light of Mr. Shelton's
economic means

632
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,013
and his potential flight risk,

633
00:43:40,207 --> 00:43:43,597
the egregious nature of both
Mr. Ames's and Mr. Darby's deaths,

634
00:43:43,794 --> 00:43:47,616
the state requests that
bail be denied, Your honor.

635
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:50,922
Seeing as how you've...

636
00:43:51,134 --> 00:43:54,126
waived your right to
counsel, Mr. Shelton,

637
00:43:54,304 --> 00:43:56,522
do you have anything to say?

638
00:43:56,723 --> 00:43:58,714
Mr. Shelton?

639
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:03,203
Do you have anything
that you'd like to say, Mr. Shelton?

640
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:05,718
Yes yes yes, Your honor.

641
00:44:05,899 --> 00:44:08,754
- Should I stand?
- Please.

642
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:19,890
Your honor, I'm a law-abiding citizen.

643
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,934
I'm just a regular guy.

644
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:24,877
I am not a flight risk.

645
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:27,633
And this is my first alleged offense.

646
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,423
And the prosecution has not presented
one single piece of evidence against me.

647
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:35,982
Now in these circumstances,

648
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:38,659
unless the state has obtained
some new piece of information

649
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:41,568
relating to my involvement
in the matter in question,

650
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:45,659
then I find it highly prejudicial,
even constitutionally offensive,

651
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:48,108
to keep me detained without bail.

652
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:50,364
It's a slippery slope,
Your honor.

653
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:53,652
haven't we seen the result
of such violations,

654
00:44:53,864 --> 00:44:56,253
both internationally and domestically?
Case in point

655
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,705
would be Day v. McDonough,
docket #041325.

656
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:07,476
I am actually inclined
to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.

657
00:45:08,754 --> 00:45:11,803
Your honor, Mr. Shelton has
agreed to give us a full confession.

658
00:45:13,258 --> 00:45:14,941
has he given it, Mr. Rice?

659
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,557
No, Your honor.

660
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:19,413
Well, then in my opinion,

661
00:45:19,598 --> 00:45:22,317
the state has failed to establish
a compelling basis

662
00:45:22,517 --> 00:45:25,668
for its motion,
and I will grant bail in the amount of-

663
00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:28,004
Your honor,
l would caution you not to do that.

664
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,841
Thank you.

665
00:45:31,026 --> 00:45:32,539
Excuse me?

666
00:45:32,736 --> 00:45:35,318
No, I don't think I will excuse you.

667
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,384
You see, this is what
I'm talking about.

668
00:45:37,574 --> 00:45:40,463
You were about to let me go.
Are you kidding me?

669
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,050
This is why we're here
in the first place.

670
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:47,986
You think I don't remember
who you are, lady?

671
00:45:48,168 --> 00:45:50,989
I would tread carefully, Mr. Shelton.

672
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:52,854
Well, how carefully
should I tread?

673
00:45:53,048 --> 00:45:55,733
Because apparently
l just killed two people,

674
00:45:55,926 --> 00:45:59,350
and you were about to let me
walk right out that door!

675
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:01,909
how misguided are you?

676
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:05,420
I feed you a couple of
bullshit legal precedents,

677
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:08,651
and there you go- you jump
on it like a bitch in heat.

678
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:11,278
- Folks, you all hang out-
- I'm warning you, Mr. Shelton!

679
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:13,371
- -in the same little club.
- You will be held in contempt!

680
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:15,752
And every day you let madmen
and murderers back on the street.

681
00:46:15,946 --> 00:46:18,335
- You're too busy treating the law-
- One more time!

682
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:19,885
- -like it's a fucking assembly line!
- One more time.

683
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:21,758
- Do you have any idea what justice is?
- You are now-

684
00:46:21,952 --> 00:46:23,840
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- -in contempt of court.

685
00:46:24,037 --> 00:46:27,086
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- Remove this man.

686
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,713
- Whatever happened to the people?
- Bail denied!

687
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:31,840
- Whatever happened to justice?
- Bail denied!

688
00:46:32,045 --> 00:46:35,230
And I bet you take it up
the fucking ass, bitch.

689
00:46:35,423 --> 00:46:36,572
Bailiff.

690
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:38,510
hey, see you later, Nick.

691
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:41,987
Insanity?

692
00:46:43,098 --> 00:46:45,919
That's what you're building
your defense on? Insanity?

693
00:46:48,603 --> 00:46:50,753
Nick, I told you I would
give you a confession.

694
00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:52,622
And l- I meant it.

695
00:46:55,068 --> 00:46:57,889
My daughter saw the same movie.

696
00:46:58,071 --> 00:47:00,926
Well, you taught your daughter
about good versus evil?

697
00:47:01,116 --> 00:47:02,731
I don't have to.

698
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:06,375
good conquering evil,

699
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,901
the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

700
00:47:09,082 --> 00:47:10,970
I didn't get that.

701
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:14,159
I'm gonna give you
one more chance, Clyde.

702
00:47:14,337 --> 00:47:17,818
And don't test me
'cause I will run you over.

703
00:47:18,008 --> 00:47:19,896
Fair enough.

704
00:47:20,093 --> 00:47:22,607
You did get me my bed.

705
00:47:22,804 --> 00:47:25,056
A deal's a deal.

706
00:47:25,265 --> 00:47:27,950
That was you on video
killing Clarence Darby, wasn't it?

707
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:29,861
Yes, that was me.

708
00:47:32,772 --> 00:47:35,661
Okay, fair enough.
That was me, Clyde Shelton,

709
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:37,713
on the video,
killing Clarence Darby.

710
00:47:37,903 --> 00:47:39,951
Not good enough, Clyde.
l need specifics.

711
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:45,957
I took his fingers with bolt cutters,

712
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:47,344
his toes with tin snips,

713
00:47:47,537 --> 00:47:49,858
his balls with a hacksaw,

714
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,294
and his penis with a box cutter.

715
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:55,184
how's that for specifics?

716
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:57,649
And Ames?

717
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,423
Switching the canisters was easy.
Everything's automated these days,

718
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:03,853
so I just hacked into
the shipping company's server

719
00:48:04,054 --> 00:48:06,943
and swapped a few numbers around
so the package came to me.

720
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,324
Then I switched
the potassium chloride

721
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:13,772
with something a little more...
deliberate.

722
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:17,173
Well, I'm tired of
hearing your bullshit.

723
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,247
I got everything I need.

724
00:48:20,278 --> 00:48:21,597
What now?

725
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,498
I go home;
you go to prison.

726
00:48:23,698 --> 00:48:26,087
You know, the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

727
00:48:26,284 --> 00:48:28,502
That ought to make you
feel better about the system.

728
00:48:28,703 --> 00:48:29,954
What if I had another
confession to make?

729
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:31,846
Call a priest.

730
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,894
But another confession would
mean another deal, Nick,

731
00:48:34,084 --> 00:48:37,099
so you would have to
give me something in return.

732
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,333
You ever been to Del Frisco's?
They cater.

733
00:48:44,511 --> 00:48:48,333
So for lunch, I would love
a 20oz porterhouse steak,

734
00:48:48,515 --> 00:48:50,938
medium,
maybe a little bit charred,

735
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:55,397
with all the trimmings-
pommes frites, asparagus, butter squash.

736
00:48:55,605 --> 00:48:58,119
Fuck you and your pommes frites.

737
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:02,298
can I have my iPod as well?

738
00:49:02,487 --> 00:49:05,308
I'd love a little bit
of music with my meal.

739
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,345
you
gotta have something to bargain with.

740
00:49:08,535 --> 00:49:12,016
Would the life of
Bill Reynolds suffice?

741
00:49:17,377 --> 00:49:20,528
Open it.

742
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:25,040
Who the fuck is Bill Reynolds?

743
00:49:25,218 --> 00:49:26,833
Darby's attorney.

744
00:49:27,053 --> 00:49:29,442
Tell me you located him.

745
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:33,188
I've got his wife.
She reported him missing three days ago.

746
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:35,247
Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds.

747
00:49:35,437 --> 00:49:38,452
Well, looks like I got something
to bargain with after all, Nick.

748
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:42,607
At the moment,
Bill Reynolds is still alive.

749
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:45,674
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

750
00:49:45,864 --> 00:49:49,686
Just bring me my meal and
00 exactly.

751
00:49:49,868 --> 00:49:52,257
00 sharp.

752
00:49:52,454 --> 00:49:54,536
00, Nick.

753
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:10,441
That's good, right there.

754
00:50:14,392 --> 00:50:16,144
All right, up!

755
00:50:22,484 --> 00:50:26,033
- 00.
- I don't take orders from him or you.

756
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:28,091
And inmates don't have
access to the time.

757
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:31,170
- We tell them what time it is.
- I don't care if he has a Rolex or not.

758
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:33,380
We need to stick to the timeline
that was agreed to.

759
00:50:33,578 --> 00:50:35,660
Fuck him, Nick.
Let him wait.

760
00:50:35,872 --> 00:50:37,555
Christ, he sawed a guy's dick off.

761
00:50:37,749 --> 00:50:39,899
Whether you like it or not,
we are on his time.

762
00:50:40,085 --> 00:50:41,939
Check it again.

763
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:48,313
Are you shitting me with this?!

764
00:50:51,137 --> 00:50:52,616
This motherfucker!

765
00:50:57,268 --> 00:50:59,816
Man, come on!
I'm fucking hungry!

766
00:51:05,652 --> 00:51:07,836
Steamed asparagus,

767
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:10,850
- lobster macaroni and cheese...
- Wow.

768
00:51:12,408 --> 00:51:15,559
...porterhouse steak,
seared, medium rare.

769
00:51:17,247 --> 00:51:18,669
Mmm!

770
00:51:23,169 --> 00:51:24,818
hmm.

771
00:51:25,004 --> 00:51:27,052
- Napkin, Nick.
- Napkin.

772
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,372
Oh, excuse me, waiter?

773
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:35,569
You might want to put 30%
down for yourself, my man.

774
00:51:38,685 --> 00:51:41,540
- hey, what time is it?
- 00.

775
00:51:42,856 --> 00:51:44,369
ls that right, Nick?

776
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:48,252
- 08.
- That's disappointing, Warden.

777
00:51:48,444 --> 00:51:50,628
I mean, how can you expect me
not to fuck with you

778
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:52,335
when you can't even
be honest with me?

779
00:51:52,532 --> 00:51:56,389
Late or not, Clyde, you have what you
asked for. Now where's Reynolds?

780
00:51:56,578 --> 00:51:58,466
Can I have some silverware,
gentlemen?

781
00:51:58,663 --> 00:52:00,051
Silverware.

782
00:52:00,248 --> 00:52:02,500
You get a spork.

783
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:05,556
Idiot.

784
00:52:07,922 --> 00:52:09,571
Thanks.

785
00:52:18,516 --> 00:52:20,438
Come on, Clyde.

786
00:52:25,148 --> 00:52:26,604
Okay.

787
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:29,535
here we go:

788
00:52:29,736 --> 00:52:32,819
39N57'...

789
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:34,578
04'',

790
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:38,434
075W10'22''.

791
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,201
And you'd better hurry, Nick.

792
00:52:40,413 --> 00:52:42,927
'Cause by anybody's watch but
the warden's, you're already late.

793
00:52:43,124 --> 00:52:45,809
- Open the door!
- Where's my lunch?

794
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,768
I'll take a ground unit!

795
00:53:16,658 --> 00:53:19,547
So I suppose if I don't
share this with you, you're gonna-

796
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:21,166
I'm gonna get the fuck up,

797
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:23,362
I'm gonna cock back
my right hand,

798
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:27,088
and I'm gonna split your whole
fucking skull in two. how about that?

799
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,924
Well, come on over here. Join me.
There's plenty to go around.

800
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:39,905
here, enjoy.
have some pasta.

801
00:53:40,098 --> 00:53:42,180
It's good.

802
00:53:42,392 --> 00:53:43,973
What about some steak?
You want steak?

803
00:53:44,185 --> 00:53:45,664
- Mmm.
- here, have some steak.

804
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:47,935
here's a big piece for you.

805
00:53:48,147 --> 00:53:50,229
There you go.

806
00:53:53,987 --> 00:53:55,409
Good, huh?

807
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:07,516
What'd you do
to get in here, anyways?

808
00:54:09,752 --> 00:54:12,004
I did what I had to do.

809
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,444
So you got a girl or something?

810
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:24,828
Mmm, it's a long story.

811
00:54:28,855 --> 00:54:30,709
Pilot, how much longer?

812
00:54:30,898 --> 00:54:33,947
Two minutes.

813
00:54:36,821 --> 00:54:39,210
how about you?
You have a girl?

814
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:41,887
- Got a few girls back home.
- Oh, yeah?

815
00:54:42,076 --> 00:54:43,725
Yeah.

816
00:54:43,911 --> 00:54:46,903
- You have a boyfriend in here or no?
- Get the fuck out of here.

817
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:02,923
This is- it's Reynolds'.

818
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:06,453
- Not a good sign, Nick.
- Just dig.

819
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,276
- Jesus Christ!
- Reynolds!

820
00:55:22,492 --> 00:55:25,507
- he's unconscious.
- Reynolds!

821
00:55:25,703 --> 00:55:28,695
he's gone, Nick.
he's gone.

822
00:55:28,873 --> 00:55:30,886
- Oxygen?
- Get something to get him out!

823
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:34,565
he's got IV lines
going to his-

824
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:36,836
he's got him cuffed!

825
00:55:37,048 --> 00:55:40,472
Listen, you got your keys
to the cuffs?

826
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,438
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

827
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,322
Shit.

828
00:55:46,516 --> 00:55:49,167
Oh, God, I'm so happy.

829
00:55:49,352 --> 00:55:51,832
Your lucky day, huh?
Get some food.

830
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:54,876
here, wanna take a shot at this?

831
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:57,148
- What is it?
- Know how to use it?

832
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,578
No.

833
00:56:16,379 --> 00:56:19,234
Oh, shit! Check this out!

834
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:24,561
he's crazy!

835
00:56:24,762 --> 00:56:26,241
Don't stop now, partner!

836
00:56:26,431 --> 00:56:29,252
Finish him, come on!
Take his head off!

837
00:56:29,434 --> 00:56:33,655
Take it off!

838
00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:05,864
I need a shower, Warden.

839
00:57:06,053 --> 00:57:07,236
Get him out of there!

840
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:13,231
Dunnigan,
what time do you have?

841
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:16,772
37.

842
00:57:16,981 --> 00:57:18,733
Took us roughly 15 minutes
to get here.

843
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:19,987
Yeah?

844
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:22,673
Reynolds' air was rigged to
15.

845
00:57:22,862 --> 00:57:25,581
If Shelton would have got
his lunch on time, he'd still be alive.

846
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:27,032
Fuck this guy, Nick.

847
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:30,961
he wants to play games,
we can play games too.

848
00:57:31,162 --> 00:57:33,483
We need to take the gloves off.

849
00:57:33,664 --> 00:57:35,347
No.

850
00:57:39,504 --> 00:57:42,519
Nick, it's Sarah.
Listen, Clyde murdered his cell-mate.

851
00:57:42,715 --> 00:57:46,572
The warden is furious.
he's moving him to solitary.

852
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:48,979
That's all I know right now.

853
00:58:19,877 --> 00:58:22,698
how are we doing?

854
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,769
Great. Can you believe this?

855
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:29,050
Checking his iPod for clues.

856
00:58:29,262 --> 00:58:30,775
I do the same thing
with my daughter's.

857
00:58:30,972 --> 00:58:32,655
Learn anything?

858
00:58:32,848 --> 00:58:35,237
Yeah, they both got
shit taste in music.

859
00:58:37,311 --> 00:58:39,666
We got a game plan
with this guy or what?

860
00:58:39,855 --> 00:58:41,402
Game plan?

861
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:43,461
I tell you, I got a game plan.

862
00:58:43,651 --> 00:58:46,336
Give me five minutes alone with him
and I'll cripple the fucker.

863
00:58:46,529 --> 00:58:49,521
I don't give a shit
what happened to his family.

864
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:51,121
It's no excuse.

865
00:58:58,249 --> 00:58:59,796
Wow.

866
00:59:06,966 --> 00:59:08,581
Stop right there.

867
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,993
Step into the cell.

868
01:00:05,232 --> 01:00:07,655
We found Reynolds.

869
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,784
Moments too late,
from what I hear.

870
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:14,708
I had to call his wife and tell her
that her husband had been buried alive.

871
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:17,730
Justice should be harsh, Nick,

872
01:00:17,912 --> 01:00:20,392
but especially for those
who denied it to others.

873
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:23,129
And your cell-mate?
What was that about?

874
01:00:26,921 --> 01:00:29,674
You murdered a man
because your lunch was late.

875
01:00:29,882 --> 01:00:31,668
No.

876
01:00:31,884 --> 01:00:36,105
No. No, you murdered him
because you couldn't keep your word.

877
01:00:36,305 --> 01:00:39,354
00 PM.

878
01:00:39,558 --> 01:00:42,413
That's a pretty important principle
I'd like you start learning, Nick:

879
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:44,491
- keeping your word.
- Oh, really?

880
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:47,578
What principle was at work when
you tortured and killed those people?

881
01:00:47,775 --> 01:00:51,632
That everyone must be held
accountable for their actions.

882
01:00:57,785 --> 01:01:00,504
You think your wife
and daughter would feel good

883
01:01:00,705 --> 01:01:03,526
about you killing in their name?

884
01:01:29,275 --> 01:01:32,790
My wife and daughter
can't feel anything.

885
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:36,187
They're dead.

886
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:14,073
hey, Nick?

887
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:16,599
On Clyde's real estate,
Judge Stansfield shut us down.

888
01:02:16,781 --> 01:02:20,205
he's looking for some sort of legal
precedent that I'm not sure exists.

889
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:21,421
- But?
- But...

890
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:22,870
I think I may have found
a way around it.

891
01:02:23,078 --> 01:02:25,228
- I'll call in a favor from a friend.
- Who's your friend?

892
01:02:25,414 --> 01:02:27,564
You don't name your friends
or they stop doing you favors.

893
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,365
Something else Cantrell said.

894
01:02:29,585 --> 01:02:33,578
No, that was all you.
Jonas, hi.

895
01:02:34,632 --> 01:02:37,681
She's thinking just like you, Nick.
Guess you trained her well.

896
01:02:37,885 --> 01:02:40,877
- One day she'll have my job.
- Let's get some air.

897
01:02:43,933 --> 01:02:46,254
Clyde's government contract payments
were bothering me,

898
01:02:46,435 --> 01:02:48,983
so I pulled some ancient strings.
We're meeting someone.

899
01:02:49,188 --> 01:02:50,610
Who might that be?

900
01:02:50,815 --> 01:02:54,637
Someone who does some really nasty shit
so we can live the American dream.

901
01:03:06,831 --> 01:03:08,753
So Clyde finally lost it?

902
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:11,040
Somebody must have
really pissed him off.

903
01:03:11,252 --> 01:03:13,573
You worked with Shelton,
is that right?

904
01:03:13,754 --> 01:03:17,440
Okay, first of all,
l was never here and we never spoke.

905
01:03:17,633 --> 01:03:20,215
Tell us what we're dealing with.
Shelton was a spy or-

906
01:03:20,427 --> 01:03:22,975
Spies are a dime a dozen.
I'm a spy.

907
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,661
Clyde is a brain.
he's a think-tank type guy.

908
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:29,331
his specialty was low-impact
kinetic operations.

909
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,875
ls this a hell of a fancy way
to say that he kills people?

910
01:03:32,064 --> 01:03:33,144
We kill people.

911
01:03:33,357 --> 01:03:35,837
he figured out how to do it
without ever being in the same room.

912
01:03:36,026 --> 01:03:39,348
It was his gift,
and he was the best.

913
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,919
One time we're tasking
this tricky target.

914
01:03:42,116 --> 01:03:44,596
I mean, we're using cruise missiles
and predators

915
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:48,539
and we even had a B-2 bomber
flatten this guy's villa with a JDAM.

916
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:50,328
All right? We're burning up
millions in ordnance

917
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:51,860
and we're getting nowhere
with this guy.

918
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:54,931
So we call Clyde and
we ask him to solve our problem.

919
01:03:55,129 --> 01:03:57,017
Clyde develops a Kevlar thread

920
01:03:57,214 --> 01:03:59,865
with a high-tech ratchet
made of carbon fiber

921
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,904
put in a necktie.

922
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:04,642
Two days later, Mrs. Bad Guy
comes home,

923
01:04:04,847 --> 01:04:07,532
finds Mr. Bad Guy dead
on the bathroom tile,

924
01:04:07,725 --> 01:04:09,010
choked to death.

925
01:04:10,853 --> 01:04:13,708
What I'm saying is, just assume
that this guy can hear and see

926
01:04:13,898 --> 01:04:15,513
everything that you're doing.

927
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:17,815
No, we've got him locked away,
maximum security.

928
01:04:18,027 --> 01:04:21,019
If he's in jail, it's because
he wants to be in jail.

929
01:04:21,196 --> 01:04:24,848
he's a born tactician. Every move
that he makes, it means something.

930
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:28,333
That cell-mate that he killed-
you think that was random?

931
01:04:29,997 --> 01:04:31,680
No.

932
01:04:31,874 --> 01:04:34,456
That's a pawn being
moved off the board.

933
01:04:36,086 --> 01:04:38,907
If I were you,
I'd be looking for the next piece.

934
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:41,740
Anybody who had anything
to do with that case,

935
01:04:44,929 --> 01:04:49,116
So what are you saying?
You saying we can't stop him?

936
01:04:51,226 --> 01:04:54,047
Walk into his cell
and put a bullet in his head.

937
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,864
Aside from that?
No, you can't stop him.

938
01:04:59,068 --> 01:05:01,491
If Clyde wants you dead,
you're dead.

939
01:05:12,998 --> 01:05:15,990
- hello?
- Sarah? Sarah, it's Nick.

940
01:05:16,168 --> 01:05:17,886
Set up a meeting
with Judge Burch.

941
01:05:18,087 --> 01:05:20,078
We need her to help us
keep Clyde on ice.

942
01:05:20,255 --> 01:05:22,837
help us with what, Nick?
The man's in prison.

943
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,733
he's worse than we thought.

944
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:27,350
- Chester's your boyfriend, right?
- Chester.

945
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:29,374
Yeah.

946
01:05:29,556 --> 01:05:32,741
Good. Maybe stay a few days
at his place.

947
01:05:32,935 --> 01:05:35,950
And have Dunnigan send
a patrol car to my house.

948
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:37,864
Sorry about this, Sarah.

949
01:05:45,114 --> 01:05:47,332
l can't supersede the penal code.

950
01:05:47,533 --> 01:05:48,955
You've already got him in solitary.

951
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:51,377
A half-decent paralegal will have him
out of there by next week.

952
01:05:51,578 --> 01:05:53,227
We just want to limit his options;

953
01:05:53,414 --> 01:05:55,029
give him less contact,
less access,

954
01:05:55,249 --> 01:05:58,503
even if it's just rescinding his
mandatory exercise period for a week.

955
01:05:58,711 --> 01:06:00,793
- Under what cause?
- Whatever cause you want.

956
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:03,189
Wrap it around whatever
piece of legal doctrine

957
01:06:03,382 --> 01:06:06,931
that helps you rationalize it,
Your honor.

958
01:06:08,762 --> 01:06:09,945
So let me get this straight:

959
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:12,790
you want me to violate
his God-given civil rights

960
01:06:12,975 --> 01:06:15,796
in the name of some murky sense
of the greater good.

961
01:06:15,978 --> 01:06:18,060
ls that the gist of it, gentlemen?

962
01:06:24,862 --> 01:06:27,285
Okay. I'm game.

963
01:06:28,323 --> 01:06:32,475
Just don't plan
on it sticking for long, all right?

964
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:37,681
Wait, you're gonna take that,

965
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,923
after all the grief you've
given me over cell phones?

966
01:06:40,127 --> 01:06:43,016
That's one of the benefits of
being a judge, Mr. Rice.

967
01:06:43,213 --> 01:06:46,228
I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

968
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,038
hello?

969
01:06:52,723 --> 01:06:54,304
Oh my God.

970
01:06:54,516 --> 01:06:57,064
Back out. Back out.

971
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:03,905
... at city hall, though
we are unable to confirm the details,

972
01:07:04,109 --> 01:07:06,191
we do know that
at least one person is dead

973
01:07:06,403 --> 01:07:08,485
in what officials are calling
a possible murder.

974
01:07:08,697 --> 01:07:10,915
We have reporters
on the ground...

975
01:07:11,116 --> 01:07:12,333
Up.

976
01:07:17,456 --> 01:07:19,242
Somebody's helping this guy-

977
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:21,676
a bomb in that phone,
and she doesn't know about it.

978
01:07:21,877 --> 01:07:24,801
Who had access?

979
01:07:25,005 --> 01:07:26,688
Are you okay?

980
01:07:26,882 --> 01:07:29,533
I've survived the war
and two ex-wives. I'll be fine.

981
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:33,339
how are you holding up?

982
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:35,807
I'm good.

983
01:07:51,615 --> 01:07:53,367
So you're killing judges now?

984
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:57,659
In my experience, Nick, lessons not
learned in blood are soon forgotten.

985
01:07:57,871 --> 01:08:00,453
And vengeance keeps you
warm at night.

986
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,657
Vengeance?

987
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:07,350
That's what you think this is about?
Vengeance?

988
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:09,163
What else could it be?

989
01:08:09,383 --> 01:08:13,604
No, Nick, I had 10 years
for vengeance, if that's what I wanted.

990
01:08:13,804 --> 01:08:17,388
You don't think that I watch you
go to work every morning at 8:00 AM?

991
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:21,490
Or that I watch Kelly take Denise
to school, 8:15?

992
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:25,407
No, I could have slaughtered you
or your family anytime I wanted!

993
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:28,292
You even think about
touching my family-

994
01:08:28,485 --> 01:08:32,000
you even think about touching
my family...

995
01:08:40,372 --> 01:08:42,624
I do my job.

996
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:45,188
I'm the best at it.

997
01:08:45,377 --> 01:08:47,595
- It works.
- You were doing your job

998
01:08:47,796 --> 01:08:52,051
the way that best served you, Nick-
the way that best served you.

999
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:55,478
- That has to change.
- What do you want, Clyde?

1000
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,193
You at war with the whole world?
It's not gonna bring anybody back.

1001
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:01,644
No, I'm at war with this-

1002
01:09:01,852 --> 01:09:04,867
this- this broken thing-

1003
01:09:05,063 --> 01:09:07,076
this thing that brought
you and I together.

1004
01:09:07,274 --> 01:09:09,663
This broken thing works
for people that are sane.

1005
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:12,215
You think doing what you're doing
is gonna change anything?

1006
01:09:12,404 --> 01:09:14,884
You and whoever else
you have helping you

1007
01:09:15,073 --> 01:09:17,064
are gonna pay.

1008
01:09:18,744 --> 01:09:20,826
I don't think you
have any idea

1009
01:09:21,038 --> 01:09:23,552
who's helping me
or what I'm doing.

1010
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:24,829
It's a matter of time.

1011
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:27,260
See, you see the bodies,
you see the smoke,

1012
01:09:27,461 --> 01:09:30,476
but the larger picture
still eludes you.

1013
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:32,720
Do tell.

1014
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,951
I would like to...

1015
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:38,923
but I would rather show you.

1016
01:09:41,058 --> 01:09:45,051
I still have faith in you,
so I'm gonna give you one last chance.

1017
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:46,514
here's the deal:

1018
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:51,121
release me and drop
all charges by 6:00 AM.

1019
01:09:51,318 --> 01:09:54,037
- 6:00 AM, Nick.
- Or what?

1020
01:09:56,782 --> 01:09:59,603
Or I kill everyone.

1021
01:10:10,963 --> 01:10:12,681
- hello?
- Yeah, Sarah,

1022
01:10:12,881 --> 01:10:15,873
he has to have an accomplice-
probably somebody inside the prison.

1023
01:10:16,051 --> 01:10:19,373
We have to go through all the prisoners'
files to find some sort of connection.

1024
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:21,237
Do you want the files
brought to the office?

1025
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:24,616
No, there isn't time. Get everybody
together and bring them to the prison.

1026
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,232
We're moving in.

1027
01:10:44,496 --> 01:10:46,578
Stop looking at your watch.

1028
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:50,475
Anything from your friend?

1029
01:10:50,669 --> 01:10:52,250
This treaty with Panama is a mess.

1030
01:10:52,462 --> 01:10:55,386
We can't access anything about
specific property holdings,

1031
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,444
but my friend found
this tiny loophole

1032
01:10:57,634 --> 01:11:00,819
that grants us access to
Clyde's corporate expenses.

1033
01:11:01,013 --> 01:11:02,469
Does that help?

1034
01:11:06,852 --> 01:11:10,743
So we match sale prices
of industrial properties sold in Philly

1035
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:13,624
up against purchases made
by his corporation.

1036
01:11:13,817 --> 01:11:17,139
Okay, I got it.

1037
01:11:25,871 --> 01:11:28,886
- hey, Nick, can I ask you something?
- hmm?

1038
01:11:31,835 --> 01:11:34,019
Would you do it
the same way now?

1039
01:11:34,212 --> 01:11:36,692
Would you still cut
a deal for Darby?

1040
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:42,407
This is the job, Sarah.
We have to make choices.

1041
01:11:42,596 --> 01:11:46,418
- But did you make the right choice?
- We made the right choice, right?

1042
01:11:48,977 --> 01:11:51,229
I don't know.

1043
01:11:51,438 --> 01:11:53,827
I'm 35, Nick.

1044
01:11:54,024 --> 01:11:55,946
And there are things-
there are possibilities

1045
01:11:56,151 --> 01:11:57,869
that I'm not gonna have now.

1046
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:02,962
And it's okay.
l know it's part of the deal.

1047
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:07,977
And don't get me wrong.
l love working for you.

1048
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:14,965
But I just want to make sure
l gave up those things

1049
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:18,560
for more than just
a high conviction rate.

1050
01:12:38,485 --> 01:12:40,237
Do you want any more coffee?

1051
01:12:40,445 --> 01:12:41,662
No.

1052
01:13:37,627 --> 01:13:39,845
All right.

1053
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:42,367
All right, let's just get focused here.
This guy's not God.

1054
01:13:42,549 --> 01:13:44,938
he's not the All Powerful.
he's just well-prepared.

1055
01:13:45,135 --> 01:13:47,126
We need to be equally
well-prepared.

1056
01:13:47,304 --> 01:13:50,990
Take a couple of hours, go home,
come back. We'll get a fresh start.

1057
01:13:51,183 --> 01:13:52,536
Okay?

1058
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:06,391
Come on, old man, let's see if
we can find you some breakfast.

1059
01:14:21,254 --> 01:14:23,472
hey, Nick, get some rest.

1060
01:14:23,673 --> 01:14:27,996
Give Chester my regards.
When do I get to meet him?

1061
01:14:28,178 --> 01:14:31,397
Oh, he's not ready for that.

1062
01:14:32,682 --> 01:14:34,195
'Night, Jonas.

1063
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,788
I don't know how
this one's gonna turn out, Nick.

1064
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:49,980
We're gonna stop him.
That's how it's gonna turn out.

1065
01:14:51,660 --> 01:15:02,047
Ahh!

1066
01:15:02,254 --> 01:15:04,939
Sarah.

1067
01:15:10,595 --> 01:15:12,017
Sarah.

1068
01:15:45,463 --> 01:15:48,978
In the past 48 hours, six
officials from the Justice Department

1069
01:15:49,175 --> 01:15:52,429
have been killed in a series of vicious
and premeditated attacks.

1070
01:15:52,637 --> 01:15:55,288
This marks the first time in
the history of the United States

1071
01:15:55,473 --> 01:15:58,328
where government officials have been,
by all appearances,

1072
01:15:58,518 --> 01:16:00,440
systematically murdered.

1073
01:16:00,645 --> 01:16:03,466
We'll continue to follow this story and
bring you up-to-the-minute details...

1074
01:16:07,485 --> 01:16:10,477
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this now,
but we've got something here.

1075
01:16:10,655 --> 01:16:13,340
Found this right outside the wall-

1076
01:16:13,533 --> 01:16:15,285
radio beacon-

1077
01:16:15,493 --> 01:16:18,178
sent an arming signal to the car bombs
when they went through the gate.

1078
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:20,919
Security said they checked
every car before anybody got in them.

1079
01:16:21,124 --> 01:16:24,378
They didn't check the gas tanks.
That's where the clever prick put 'em.

1080
01:16:24,586 --> 01:16:26,269
Real precise stuff too.

1081
01:16:26,463 --> 01:16:28,351
Could have taken out
a lot more if he wanted to.

1082
01:16:28,548 --> 01:16:31,301
- What about Nick's car?
- That's the weird thing.

1083
01:16:35,347 --> 01:16:37,338
I gotta go.

1084
01:16:45,148 --> 01:16:46,900
Jesus Christ.

1085
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,600
Privacy, please.

1086
01:16:59,412 --> 01:17:02,427
So let me get this straight:

1087
01:17:02,624 --> 01:17:05,513
not only do we
know who did it,

1088
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:09,760
we have him locked up
and he's still killing people?

1089
01:17:11,174 --> 01:17:15,326
You boys sure
fucked this one up.

1090
01:17:15,512 --> 01:17:19,562
The press is gonna kill us.

1091
01:17:19,766 --> 01:17:21,347
Can someone explain this to me?

1092
01:17:21,559 --> 01:17:23,242
We can't yet.

1093
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:31,824
how did this get away
from you, Jonas?

1094
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:34,212
It's complicated, April.

1095
01:17:34,406 --> 01:17:36,795
he's very smart.
he's very angry.

1096
01:17:36,991 --> 01:17:39,573
We assume he has an accomplice
helping him on the outside.

1097
01:17:39,786 --> 01:17:43,370
I'm not having
this conversation.

1098
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:47,096
I don't care how smart he is
or who's helping him.

1099
01:17:52,757 --> 01:17:56,341
We'll release a statement saying we
have suspects, we're following leads-

1100
01:17:56,553 --> 01:17:59,408
- nothing alarming.
- Mayor, you have my word,

1101
01:17:59,597 --> 01:18:03,647
we are gonna stop this guy.
he's not gonna hurt anybody else.

1102
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:11,041
I'm assigning security to
each of you from now on.

1103
01:18:15,405 --> 01:18:17,828
Get this situation
under control, gentlemen.

1104
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,274
Dad?

1105
01:18:36,468 --> 01:18:38,789
I bet you don't remember
when I did that.

1106
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:41,359
I bet you I do.

1107
01:18:56,404 --> 01:18:58,156
What?

1108
01:18:58,364 --> 01:19:00,047
Nothing.

1109
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:03,495
You and your mother are going away
on a little vacation, that's all.

1110
01:19:03,703 --> 01:19:05,250
- You like vacations, right?
- Yeah.

1111
01:19:05,455 --> 01:19:07,309
Good.

1112
01:19:07,499 --> 01:19:09,182
But why?

1113
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:11,525
Why not now?

1114
01:19:11,711 --> 01:19:13,861
Okay.

1115
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:16,868
Don't need an excuse, right?

1116
01:19:20,428 --> 01:19:21,679
All right.

1117
01:19:21,888 --> 01:19:25,813
No phone calls, no credit cards,
no computers- just cash.

1118
01:19:26,017 --> 01:19:27,564
Daddy, are you coming?

1119
01:19:27,769 --> 01:19:30,624
Oh, yeah, of course.

1120
01:19:30,814 --> 01:19:33,135
- Of course I am.
- You'd better, Nick.

1121
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,566
It was first grade, hmm?

1122
01:19:40,782 --> 01:19:42,932
Your mother helped you
with the spelling.

1123
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:45,267
It was my birthday.

1124
01:19:45,453 --> 01:19:48,206
- We need to go!
- Let's go.

1125
01:19:48,414 --> 01:19:50,063
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

1126
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,571
- Love you, Daddy.
- Love you too.

1127
01:19:57,465 --> 01:19:59,979
- Nick, your phone lines are clear.
- Good.

1128
01:20:00,176 --> 01:20:03,191
No bugs; nothing's been tampered with.
You're good.

1129
01:21:51,496 --> 01:21:53,646
You should have taken my deal.

1130
01:21:57,961 --> 01:22:02,614
That's six fucking innocent people.
ls that how you want to play it? huh?

1131
01:22:02,799 --> 01:22:05,688
It's okay.
It's okay, Nick. I know you're angry.

1132
01:22:05,885 --> 01:22:08,604
That's good. That's what it takes.
That's how it has to be.

1133
01:22:08,805 --> 01:22:10,420
What if I said you was right
and I was wrong?

1134
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,393
What if I had said, ''Well,
let's take them to trial''? huh?

1135
01:22:13,601 --> 01:22:15,182
Then I would say
you're making progress.

1136
01:22:15,395 --> 01:22:18,580
And we might have lost!
And Ames and Darby would both go free.

1137
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:21,196
Don't you get that?

1138
01:22:21,401 --> 01:22:22,618
Fuck.

1139
01:22:22,819 --> 01:22:25,003
You didn't care, Nick.
You didn't even try.

1140
01:22:25,196 --> 01:22:27,881
You could have walked out of
that courtroom with your head held high.

1141
01:22:28,074 --> 01:22:29,792
I could have lived with that, Nick.

1142
01:22:29,993 --> 01:22:31,745
I keep my head up.

1143
01:22:31,953 --> 01:22:35,707
And you will end this.

1144
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:39,624
I'm just getting warmed up.

1145
01:22:39,836 --> 01:22:42,555
This is Von Clausewitz shit-
total fucking war.

1146
01:22:42,755 --> 01:22:44,643
You fuck.

1147
01:22:49,971 --> 01:22:51,359
No.

1148
01:23:00,606 --> 01:23:03,621
I'm gonna pull
the whole thing down.

1149
01:23:03,818 --> 01:23:06,742
I'm gonna bring the whole
fucking diseased, corrupt temple

1150
01:23:06,946 --> 01:23:09,369
down on your head.

1151
01:23:09,574 --> 01:23:12,122
It's gonna be Biblical.

1152
01:23:29,552 --> 01:23:32,635
Jesus, Nick, she was a good kid.

1153
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:36,036
Did we bring this all on ourselves?

1154
01:23:38,436 --> 01:23:40,757
Absolutely not.

1155
01:23:42,982 --> 01:23:45,462
You don't actually believe that,
do you?

1156
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,753
Gentlemen? Sorry,
but we need to get going

1157
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:55,339
if we're going to make it
to the press conference.

1158
01:24:02,919 --> 01:24:07,242
I want to read you something
from my speech before we go.

1159
01:24:10,426 --> 01:24:12,417
''We must not give in
to the fear.

1160
01:24:12,595 --> 01:24:15,314
We must face
those things we fear the most.

1161
01:24:15,515 --> 01:24:17,836
We must appeal
to our better angels. ''

1162
01:24:18,017 --> 01:24:19,939
Too much?

1163
01:24:20,144 --> 01:24:22,032
I'm sorry.

1164
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:25,779
It's just before, when you asked
if we brought this on ourselves-

1165
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:28,031
we didn't.

1166
01:24:28,236 --> 01:24:29,783
I did.

1167
01:24:31,781 --> 01:24:35,968
When I was young,
l really wanted to change the system.

1168
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:40,813
You know, I was ready to fight.
l was gonna be the best no matter what.

1169
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:43,182
You give an inch here,
you give an inch there,

1170
01:24:43,376 --> 01:24:46,027
you get caught up
in the game.

1171
01:24:46,212 --> 01:24:49,693
And then you realize that the system
that you're trying to change-

1172
01:24:49,882 --> 01:24:52,362
it changed you.

1173
01:24:52,552 --> 01:24:54,440
Jonas, I've lost my way
somewhere.

1174
01:24:54,637 --> 01:24:57,117
Look, remember what I told you?

1175
01:24:57,306 --> 01:25:00,958
The hard part isn't
making the decision.

1176
01:25:01,144 --> 01:25:05,035
It's living with it.

1177
01:25:08,484 --> 01:25:11,408
Everybody stay sharp.

1178
01:25:11,612 --> 01:25:13,159
We're on the move.

1179
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:35,977
- We all right?
- It's dead.

1180
01:26:36,155 --> 01:26:37,941
Electrical system's fried.

1181
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:40,375
What's going on back there?

1182
01:26:43,454 --> 01:26:45,604
Dunnigan, tell them to
get Jonas away from here.

1183
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:56,274
What the fuck is that?

1184
01:26:58,678 --> 01:26:59,895
Get down, get down!

1185
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:26,592
Jonas! Jonas!

1186
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:29,204
- Jonas! Jonas!
- No, Nick! Get back!

1187
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:33,031
Jonas! Get your hands off me!

1188
01:27:33,212 --> 01:27:35,863
Jonas! Get out of the car!
Jonas!

1189
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:38,096
Get out of the car! Get off of me!

1190
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:46,067
Ohh.

1191
01:27:46,767 --> 01:27:48,280
Jonas!

1192
01:27:48,477 --> 01:27:50,229
Jonas.

1193
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:13,612
I told you to handle this.

1194
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:15,785
You didn't.

1195
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:17,442
Now we have a jailed psychopath

1196
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:21,021
that's managed to bring this
entire city to its knees.

1197
01:28:22,178 --> 01:28:24,897
One of my friends
was just murdered.

1198
01:28:25,931 --> 01:28:29,651
More than one of my friends
is gone, Mayor.

1199
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:32,571
What I should do is fire you.

1200
01:28:32,772 --> 01:28:35,195
hmm?
Right now.

1201
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:39,070
I resign.

1202
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:43,294
- ls that your real answer?
- I think that's best.

1203
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:49,792
No.

1204
01:28:50,873 --> 01:28:53,125
I'm not gonna allow that to happen.
Bring me the Bible.

1205
01:28:53,334 --> 01:28:57,725
I'm not gonna let some criminal decide
whether Philadelphia has a DA or not.

1206
01:28:57,922 --> 01:29:00,311
As of now, you're acting
District Attorney.

1207
01:29:00,508 --> 01:29:03,500
We'll have a formal
swearing in later.

1208
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:06,862
For now this will suffice.
Stand up.

1209
01:29:08,599 --> 01:29:11,022
Put your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

1210
01:29:11,227 --> 01:29:13,013
Repeat after me.

1211
01:29:13,229 --> 01:29:15,151
- l, Nicolas Rice...
- l, Nicolas Rice...

1212
01:29:15,356 --> 01:29:17,369
- ... do solemnly swear...
- ... do solemnly swear...

1213
01:29:17,566 --> 01:29:19,318
- ... that I will support...
- ... that I will support...

1214
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:20,573
- ... obey...
- ... obey...

1215
01:29:20,778 --> 01:29:23,429
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

1216
01:29:23,614 --> 01:29:25,468
...and defend the
Constitution of the United States...

1217
01:29:25,658 --> 01:29:28,582
...and the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...

1218
01:29:37,628 --> 01:29:40,381
People aren't going to work;
kids aren't going to school.

1219
01:29:40,589 --> 01:29:43,012
They're scared,
and I don't blame them.

1220
01:29:43,217 --> 01:29:47,404
So I'm implementing the emergency
provision of the Philadelphia code.

1221
01:29:47,596 --> 01:29:48,847
We're gonna lock this city down.

1222
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,207
Starting now, no one moves
in this city unrestricted.

1223
01:29:52,685 --> 01:29:55,006
I want a show of force
for the public-

1224
01:29:55,187 --> 01:29:57,735
uniforms, detectives,
12-hour shifts.

1225
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,794
Put an armed cop on every corner.

1226
01:29:59,984 --> 01:30:02,566
If you have to give shotguns
to the meter maids, do it.

1227
01:30:02,778 --> 01:30:04,826
There should be no doubt
in people's minds

1228
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:08,284
that this city is secure
and under our control.

1229
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,011
Okay.

1230
01:30:18,586 --> 01:30:22,238
Okay, Clyde.
l get it.

1231
01:30:25,968 --> 01:30:29,017
Listen, that contraption
that killed Cantrell,

1232
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:32,440
it was a weaponized
bomb-disposal robot.

1233
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:33,653
Can you believe that?

1234
01:30:33,851 --> 01:30:36,740
Damn thing had video, night vision-
you name it.

1235
01:30:36,937 --> 01:30:40,020
It's like military API,
for Christ's sakes.

1236
01:30:40,232 --> 01:30:43,087
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

1237
01:30:43,277 --> 01:30:45,165
I think he's saving you for last.

1238
01:30:47,865 --> 01:30:50,220
Nick, I'm serious.

1239
01:30:51,911 --> 01:30:54,800
I appreciate the insight.

1240
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:01,891
Nick, you gotta get in front of
this guy if you want to stay alive.

1241
01:31:04,757 --> 01:31:06,770
I may have a way-

1242
01:31:06,967 --> 01:31:10,516
something a friend
is helping me out with.

1243
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:12,074
Who's your friend?

1244
01:31:12,264 --> 01:31:14,846
A friend named Chester.
I'll call you back.

1245
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:18,903
Thank you, Sarah.

1246
01:31:26,362 --> 01:31:29,047
This is Nick.
Give me the real-estate listing

1247
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,630
of every industrial property sold
here in the last 10 years.

1248
01:31:58,185 --> 01:32:00,574
Motherfucker.

1249
01:32:18,956 --> 01:32:20,708
You're kidding me, right?

1250
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:24,139
You're saying Clyde
owns this place?

1251
01:32:24,336 --> 01:32:27,225
Something about it
sticks out, right?

1252
01:32:27,423 --> 01:32:29,311
Yeah.

1253
01:32:32,595 --> 01:32:35,644
What- are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1254
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:40,398
- What about his civil rights?
- Fuck his civil rights.

1255
01:32:42,354 --> 01:32:45,243
Yes!

1256
01:33:30,235 --> 01:33:32,624
There's got to be
something in here.

1257
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:34,504
Yeah.

1258
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:52,837
Remember this from
outside the house?

1259
01:33:59,807 --> 01:34:01,354
Yeah.

1260
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:03,412
Get that right there.

1261
01:34:20,035 --> 01:34:22,720
Un-fucking-believable.

1262
01:34:36,427 --> 01:34:38,645
Look at this.

1263
01:34:43,976 --> 01:34:45,830
Watch your step.

1264
01:34:51,191 --> 01:34:53,773
This guy tunneled into prison?

1265
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:23,765
Oh, shit.

1266
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:30,720
Fuck- Semtex.

1267
01:35:34,985 --> 01:35:38,569
Got police uniforms,
other disguises.

1268
01:36:02,221 --> 01:36:04,234
he tunneled into every cell.

1269
01:36:05,265 --> 01:36:06,948
Over here.

1270
01:36:13,315 --> 01:36:15,829
he wanted to be
transferred to solitary.

1271
01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:18,711
Surprise, motherfucker.

1272
01:37:01,655 --> 01:37:04,738
- he's not here!
- If he's not there, then where is he?

1273
01:37:10,497 --> 01:37:12,078
Nomos, what happened to your eye?

1274
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:13,747
Oh, long story.

1275
01:37:13,959 --> 01:37:16,883
Stop right there, sir.

1276
01:37:17,087 --> 01:37:19,169
Let me see your ID, please.

1277
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:21,394
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1278
01:37:21,592 --> 01:37:24,106
Turn around, sir.
Extend your arms.

1279
01:37:25,846 --> 01:37:27,427
Something going on tonight?

1280
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:31,029
- The mayor.
- Mmm, mayor.

1281
01:37:38,567 --> 01:37:40,558
Look at this.

1282
01:37:40,736 --> 01:37:43,159
he tapped into the prison cameras.

1283
01:37:43,363 --> 01:37:45,411
Jesus, he's got
cameras everywhere.

1284
01:37:45,616 --> 01:37:47,334
- Shit.
- ls that your house?

1285
01:37:47,534 --> 01:37:50,355
Yes.

1286
01:37:51,371 --> 01:37:53,794
Baby, please tell me you're okay.

1287
01:37:53,999 --> 01:37:55,421
Denise- where is she?

1288
01:37:55,626 --> 01:37:57,309
ls she with you?
Are you sure?

1289
01:37:57,502 --> 01:37:59,220
Okay.

1290
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:01,844
Stay where you are.
I'll explain later.

1291
01:38:02,049 --> 01:38:03,835
I love you.

1292
01:38:13,894 --> 01:38:16,078
Von Clausewitz.

1293
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:22,122
Look at that.

1294
01:38:29,534 --> 01:38:31,286
he's at City hall.

1295
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:34,842
You're free to go, sir.

1296
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:38,032
- Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
- No, don't worry about it.

1297
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:42,043
Better to be safe
than sorry, right?

1298
01:38:43,548 --> 01:38:45,561
Get ready to evacuate the building.

1299
01:38:45,759 --> 01:38:47,750
We'll need a tactical unit
and a bomb squad.

1300
01:38:47,928 --> 01:38:49,145
Bad idea.
have them come in soft.

1301
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:51,997
If Shelton spots them or
any of us, we're fucked.

1302
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:18,041
hey.

1303
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:22,208
- Where's the tactical team?
- En route.

1304
01:39:22,421 --> 01:39:24,605
- They're coming in soft- no sirens.
- Bomb squad?

1305
01:39:24,798 --> 01:39:26,311
You're looking at it.

1306
01:39:26,508 --> 01:39:29,762
Right, okay. We take the north surge;
you take the west.

1307
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:31,358
We'll call.

1308
01:39:36,435 --> 01:39:37,982
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- IDs, please.

1309
01:39:38,186 --> 01:39:40,575
- he's the fucking DA.
- Good for him. IDs, please.

1310
01:39:40,772 --> 01:39:42,763
What's going on here tonight?

1311
01:39:42,941 --> 01:39:45,125
- Security meeting with all the brass.
- What floor?

1312
01:39:45,318 --> 01:39:47,206
6th floor- caucus room.

1313
01:39:50,157 --> 01:39:53,877
- What floor is this?
- That's the 5th floor, sir.

1314
01:39:54,077 --> 01:39:56,090
Directly below the caucus room.

1315
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:00,008
You catch this motherfucker red-handed,
we gotta take him alive.

1316
01:40:22,147 --> 01:40:23,933
Where is he?

1317
01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:26,697
What the fuck are we looking for?

1318
01:40:26,902 --> 01:40:28,950
Wait wait wait.

1319
01:40:29,154 --> 01:40:30,337
Right there.

1320
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:33,215
Stand back.
Don't touch anything.

1321
01:40:34,534 --> 01:40:37,253
It wasn't exactly my first instinct.

1322
01:41:16,284 --> 01:41:18,275
Can I see your ID, please?

1323
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:27,690
All right, next car, pull forward!

1324
01:42:02,247 --> 01:42:05,762
Malglinite.

1325
01:42:05,959 --> 01:42:08,439
That's napalm, basically.
This shit'll take out the entire floor

1326
01:42:08,628 --> 01:42:10,414
and the one above us.

1327
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:14,623
Looks like it's- looks like it's
triggered by this cell phone here.

1328
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:18,885
What?
So an incoming call arms it?

1329
01:42:19,097 --> 01:42:23,022
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds
till boom time.

1330
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:26,312
- Jesus.
- Dunnigan, what are you doing?

1331
01:42:26,521 --> 01:42:28,170
- I'm calling the mayor's security.
- We can't.

1332
01:42:28,356 --> 01:42:31,712
Clyde is watching. he sees him evacuate
and he will detonate this thing.

1333
01:42:31,902 --> 01:42:34,484
We don't tell the mayor anything.

1334
01:42:37,115 --> 01:42:39,265
So what do we do?

1335
01:42:49,628 --> 01:42:51,243
Wait a second.

1336
01:42:51,463 --> 01:42:53,317
We've got something.

1337
01:42:53,506 --> 01:42:55,326
he's pulling up.

1338
01:43:17,489 --> 01:43:19,502
Mayor April henry.

1339
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:31,776
Thank you for coming in
on short notice.

1340
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:39,932
l have one simple question.

1341
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:45,422
Why is Clyde Shelton still in my city?

1342
01:43:47,394 --> 01:43:49,476
Now I refuse to believe

1343
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:54,079
that one man is smarter
than homeland Security,

1344
01:43:54,276 --> 01:43:58,667
the FBI, the sheriff's department,
or Philly PD.

1345
01:43:58,863 --> 01:44:01,081
I don't care how we do it,
or what kind

1346
01:44:01,283 --> 01:44:04,502
of obscure legal justification
we have to invoke, gentlemen.

1347
01:44:04,703 --> 01:44:07,718
I don't care what laws
we have to bend.

1348
01:44:07,914 --> 01:44:11,805
I am sure that there is a provision
of the homeland Security Act

1349
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:14,550
that we can activate.

1350
01:44:14,754 --> 01:44:17,837
Just get him out of here
by tomorrow.

1351
01:44:24,597 --> 01:44:26,076
Clyde?

1352
01:44:30,478 --> 01:44:32,696
Nick.

1353
01:44:32,897 --> 01:44:34,785
I wasn't expecting company.

1354
01:44:38,236 --> 01:44:41,319
Yeah, I would have-
l would have cleaned up a little.

1355
01:44:41,531 --> 01:44:44,284
Never seen anybody
tunnel into prison before.

1356
01:44:50,123 --> 01:44:54,048
And the solitary confinement?
That was clever.

1357
01:44:54,252 --> 01:44:56,573
Well, that's how winners play.

1358
01:44:56,755 --> 01:44:59,906
We convince the other guy
he's making all the right moves.

1359
01:45:00,925 --> 01:45:03,405
So did you ever catch my accomplice?

1360
01:45:03,595 --> 01:45:05,210
Yeah, I did.

1361
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:07,785
It's the end of the road
for you now.

1362
01:45:12,228 --> 01:45:14,776
You played us, Clyde.
You played us real good.

1363
01:45:14,981 --> 01:45:16,835
Thank you.

1364
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:20,040
You know, I'm glad you finally
get to appreciate

1365
01:45:20,236 --> 01:45:22,124
some of the effort that
l put into all of this.

1366
01:45:22,322 --> 01:45:24,540
Well, you set out to
make a point, Clyde.

1367
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:25,787
You made it.

1368
01:45:25,992 --> 01:45:27,675
No, people still don't get it.

1369
01:45:27,869 --> 01:45:31,589
They don't appreciate what I'm trying
to say, Nick, but they will soon enough.

1370
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:33,644
A man I cared about
once told me

1371
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:35,983
that we can't retract
the decisions that we've made,

1372
01:45:36,169 --> 01:45:38,683
we can only affect the decisions
we're going to make from here.

1373
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,633
- Are you trying to save me now, Nick?
- I'm giving you a way out.

1374
01:45:41,841 --> 01:45:43,422
Big difference.

1375
01:45:43,635 --> 01:45:45,683
Stand up for those principles
you've been preaching.

1376
01:45:45,887 --> 01:45:49,436
See, we're all held accountable, Clyde.
That includes you.

1377
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:51,256
Why don't we do
the right thing here?

1378
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:54,790
I'm doing the right thing, Nick.

1379
01:45:56,815 --> 01:45:58,430
You just have to see it that way.

1380
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:00,003
By murdering all those people,

1381
01:46:00,193 --> 01:46:03,014
all you're doing is
destroying the memory of your daughter

1382
01:46:03,196 --> 01:46:06,711
and causing the same pain
that you're suffering from.

1383
01:46:13,456 --> 01:46:17,847
So what do you suggest, Nick?
Make another deal?

1384
01:46:18,044 --> 01:46:21,093
One final offer?
ls that what it is?

1385
01:46:24,092 --> 01:46:27,744
I don't make deals with
murderers anymore, Clyde.

1386
01:46:27,929 --> 01:46:29,920
You taught me that.

1387
01:46:34,477 --> 01:46:38,163
Finally.

1388
01:46:40,358 --> 01:46:42,906
Well done. Bravo.

1389
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:46,035
Maybe I wasn't such
a bad teacher after all.

1390
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:48,423
If you go through with this, Clyde,
it's a decision

1391
01:46:48,616 --> 01:46:51,164
you'll have to live with
for the rest of your life.

1392
01:47:15,059 --> 01:47:16,913
I'm sorry, Nick.

1393
01:47:19,606 --> 01:47:21,494
Me too.

1394
01:47:31,701 --> 01:47:33,555
Like I said, Clyde,

1395
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:36,669
it's a decision you'll have to
live with for the rest of your life,

1396
01:47:36,873 --> 01:47:40,195
which I figure by now
is about 25 more seconds.
