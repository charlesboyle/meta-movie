1
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,213
Move!

2
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,379
It's life or death now, James.

3
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,758
By that,
I mean you're doing one or the other

4
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:31,095
up in Rockview.

5
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,515
This here is
District Attorney Rodin.

6
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,935
Want to know what he's wondering?

7
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,439
Whether you're gonna walk
like a man or cry like a pussy

8
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,274
on your way to the death house.

9
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,776
See, the D.A. likes the needle,

10
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,862
whereas me,

11
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,781
I like to see a man like you
live a long life

12
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,783
with all your teeth knocked out.

13
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:56,954
Passed around till a brother
can't tell your fart from a yawn.

14
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,206
Now, I don't know
what kind of man you are,

15
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,125
which of these two fates you prefer,

16
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,796
but Rodin here is a generous fellow.
He's willing to let you take your pick.

17
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:11,135
If you save us and this city
a long and costly trial,

18
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:15,556
waive your right to counsel and confess,
right now.

19
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,235
Sixteen hours.

20
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,821
Has to be some kind of
record, Detective.

21
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,495
What the hell is this?

22
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,508
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

23
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,844
<i>Jack Reacher,</i>

24
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,349
born Jack, not John, no middle name,
is a ghost.

25
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,937
No driver's license, current or expired.
No residence, current or former.

26
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:08,192
No credit cards, no credit history.
No P.O. box, cell phone, e-mail.

27
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,860
Nothing.

28
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,445
Can you at least tell me who he is?

29
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,698
Well, I can tell you who he was.
Blood military.

30
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,951
<i>Born and raised on bases abroad.</i>

31
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,037
<i>Mother was a French national,
father in the Corps.</i>

32
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,624
<i>His first trip to the United States
was to attend West Point.</i>

33
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,584
<i>Four years later, he ships out for good.</i>

34
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:29,547
<i>Iraq. Afghanistan. The Balkans.
You name it.</i>

35
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,049
<i>Served with distinction.</i>

36
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:35,386
<i>Silver Star, Bronze Star,
Legion of Merit.</i>

37
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,307
Defense Superior Service Medal?
Had to look that one up.

38
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,893
And a Purple Heart.
He spent the bulk of his service

39
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:47,148
in the Military Police.
By all accounts, a brilliant investigator.

40
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,733
Apparently, a troublemaker, too.

41
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,402
<i>Demoted to Captain.</i>

42
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,070
<i>Worked his way back to Major.</i>

43
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,574
<i>Then two years ago, he musters out.</i>

44
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:01,912
<i>After a literal lifetime in the military,
he just up and quits. And then,</i>

45
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,081
for only the second time in his life,

46
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:08,002
he enters the United States
and simply disappears.

47
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,837
<i>Dead, maybe?</i>

48
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,424
<i>Not according to Social Security
and a bank account in Virginia.</i>

49
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,843
<i>His pension is deposited monthly</i>

50
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:20,097
<i>and someone is making the occasional
withdrawal. All wire transfers.</i>

51
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,767
<i>I can't find out where
without a federal warrant.</i>

52
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,353
<i>Well, he can't drive or fly.</i>

53
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:27,897
<i>At least not under his real name.</i>

54
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,609
<i>- Any warrants?
- Record's clean.</i>

55
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,196
Come on! A guy this hard to find?
Gotta be wanted for something.

56
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:36,780
His record is clean.

57
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,866
So,

58
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,455
how do we find this Reacher?

59
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,125
Obviously, you don't find this guy
unless he wants to be found.

60
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,464
Excuse me, sir. There's
a Jack Reacher here to see you.

61
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,973
Can I help you?

62
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,559
James Barr.

63
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,653
So, now you've seen him.
How do you know him?

64
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,239
Why wasn't he in protective custody?

65
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,492
That was an oversight.

66
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,911
More like some Corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves.

67
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,829
<i>Just as likely.</i>

68
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,998
But it's done and we can't undo it.

69
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,291
So what happens now?

70
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,669
Well, now he's in a coma.

71
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,506
We'll try him when he wakes up.
If he wakes up.

72
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,299
Okay? Now it's your turn, Reacher.

73
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,677
Why did he call you as a witness?

74
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,345
I don't believe he did.

75
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,113
Well, I believe
he asked for you by name.

76
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,826
Any chance I could look
at the evidence?

77
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,518
No way.
Not till you answer some questions.

78
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,852
Nice meeting you.

79
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,271
- Hey. Hey. Hey!
- Mr. Reacher.

80
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,855
- Mr. Reacher!
- Hey, stop! Stop right there!

81
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:53,357
We had a deal.

82
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,693
I take you to Barr,
you tell me what you know.

83
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,529
I know you say he shot five people,
I know he's in a coma.

84
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,697
I know there's a bus station
three miles away

85
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,615
and I can walk there in 24 minutes.

86
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,579
So you're just going to
walk out on your friend?

87
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,869
- He's not my friend.
- Why'd he ask for you, then?

88
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,872
Well, same reason he shot five people,
he's crazy.

89
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,040
Hey. Hold on.

90
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,375
Don't do that.

91
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,378
Well, this is a new low,
even for both of you.

92
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,213
You do not talk to my client
without me present.

93
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,298
You know that.

94
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,467
We weren't talking to your client.
He's in a coma, for Christ's sakes.

95
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,137
- You're Barr's attorney?
- Helen Rodin, Jack Reacher.

96
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,055
- Jack Reacher?
- Helen Rodin.

97
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,807
Yeah, she's the
District Attorney's daughter.

98
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,011
It's a good story, actually.

99
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,059
I'd like to hear it.

100
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,312
How'd you find him?
How'd they find you?

101
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,897
You can't be talking to this man.
Two strikes in one day.

102
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,905
- It's not what it looks like.
- He came to us.

103
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,652
- You went to the D.A.?
- Ls there a law against that?

104
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,195
None you're currently breaking.

105
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,323
Come on, before this gets awkward.
Now, hey.

106
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,742
Say, "See you in court." For me.

107
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,410
Good bye, Detective.

108
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,412
- Weird meeting you.
- Likewise.

109
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:49,830
Let's go.

110
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,917
So...

111
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,422
So, you're Jack Reacher.

112
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,258
- So you're the D.A.'s daughter.
- Oh, Jesus. Please.

113
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,177
- Is that even legal?
- Fortunately.

114
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,668
- How does that happen?
- I'll tell you after deposition.

115
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,800
You don't want to depose me.

116
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,015
Oh, well, you're my only
defense witness.

117
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,768
- I'm not a defense witness.
- Your friend James thinks you are.

118
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,353
He's not my friend.
Why does everyone assume that?

119
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,437
Well, why else would he ask for you

120
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,605
and why would you
come here to help him?

121
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,067
I didn't come here to help him.
I came here to bury him.

122
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,718
Linsky.

123
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,639
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

124
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,143
- So why are you so hard to find?
- I'm impossible to find.

125
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,311
Why is that?

126
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,815
Well, you could say it started out as an
exercise and became an addiction.

127
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,983
Are you on the run?

128
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,571
My bus is leaving.
You better hurry, counselor.

129
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:05,739
How do you know James Barr?

130
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,491
- Why are you representing him?
- I'm a lawyer.

131
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,215
So is a public defender, with just as
much chance of clearing Barr.

132
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,662
I'm not trying to clear him,

133
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,164
I am just trying
to keep him off death row.

134
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,751
- By proving he's insane?
- Well, that's one option.

135
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,503
And sticking it to your father because...

136
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,089
No. Not my father.
The Office of the District Attorney.

137
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,853
Because the Office of the District
Attorney never bought you a pony.

138
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,595
D.A. Rodin's never lost a capital case.
You know why?

139
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,264
Impeccable tailoring.

140
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,183
- He never picks a fight he can't win.
- Worked for the Red Baron.

141
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,935
Every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice.

142
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,687
Confess or face death.

143
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,106
Against a D.A. who never loses.

144
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,358
My firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man

145
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,943
has gone down without a fight.

146
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,028
Oh, I get it.

147
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,197
You're an idealist.

148
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,533
No. I'm a pacifist.

149
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,118
It's a noble crusade.

150
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:55,122
But this is not the fight. Trust me.
James Barr's guilty.

151
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,040
You haven't even seen the evidence.

152
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,130
Is this a privileged conversation?

153
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:06,967
Of course, it's a client conference.
Nothing you say here can be repeated.

154
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,722
There are four types of people
who join the military.

155
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,557
For some, it's a family trade.

156
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,393
Others are patriots, eager to serve.

157
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,729
Next, you have those
who just need a job.

158
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:23,233
Then there's the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people.

159
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,569
James Barr was one of those.

160
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,905
<i>He made sniper.</i>

161
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,241
<i>Trained hard.
Two thousand rounds a week.</i>

162
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,702
<i>And with every shot,
he's taught to visualize</i>

163
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,371
<i>the base of a man's skull
through his reticule.</i>

164
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,416
<i>The sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine.</i>

165
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,086
<i>Visualize that puff of pink mist.</i>

166
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,757
<i>Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.</i>

167
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,759
<i>He's put on overwatch.</i>

168
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,304
<i>All day long
he stares through a scope at civilians.</i>

169
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,097
<i>Women.</i>

170
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,432
<i>Children.</i>

171
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,602
Day in, day out, for two long years

172
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,730
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot.

173
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,608
Then comes the drawdown.

174
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,236
For James Barr, the war's over.

175
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,113
<i>Two thousand rounds a week.</i>

176
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:14,076
<i>A quarter million rounds in his career,
not one at a human target.</i>

177
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,454
<i>You've been hungry.
You've been horny.</i>

178
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,123
<i>You've had an itch you can't scratch.</i>

179
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,628
<i>Imagine that feeling.
Days. Weeks. Years.</i>

180
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:28,966
<i>Imagine that feeling times 200,000,
plus 50,000 more.</i>

181
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,178
<i>Imagine it's 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you're going home</i>

182
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,264
<i>and you know if you don't
scratch that itch now,</i>

183
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,974
<i>you never will.</i>

184
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,976
<i>You need a release.</i>

185
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,144
<i>You need a target.</i>

186
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,439
<i>And the who of it
never once enters your mind.</i>

187
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,667
<i>He covered his tracks well,</i>

188
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,460
just like sane people do.

189
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:10,799
He almost got away with it, too.
But I caught him. And he confessed.

190
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,676
So why didn't he go to prison?

191
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,097
What Barr didn't know that day was the
four civilian contractors he'd picked off

192
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,517
<i>just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape-rally.</i>

193
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,688
It was 28 women,
ages 54 on down to 11.

194
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,692
Those were just the ones I could find
before the case was shut down.

195
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,862
See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.

196
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,532
And after seven long years
of "Mission Accomplished,"

197
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:39,202
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly.

198
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:43,206
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,
made the murders go away.

199
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,667
This is classified information.

200
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,712
And that's why the privilege.

201
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,048
But you were ready
to tell this to the D.A.

202
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:55,093
The last time I saw Barr,
I made him a promise.

203
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:59,056
And when I saw his name on the news,
I came here to keep it.

204
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,934
- But now I know I don't have to.
- How can you be sure?

205
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,562
You still haven't seen the evidence.

206
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,650
Your father has.
And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.

207
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,235
Barr's not getting away
with murder again.

208
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,196
He might.

209
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:18,075
He suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody.

210
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,993
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,

211
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,871
he may not remember the event,
he may not remember anything at all.

212
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,584
And this case won't be about
James Barr's guilt or innocence.

213
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,962
It'll be about his ability to stand trial.

214
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:36,259
After everything I just told you,
you still want to defend him?

215
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,428
I want to see he gets a fair trial.

216
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,100
You said he confessed in Baghdad.

217
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,268
He didn't confess this time.

218
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,841
- This time he knows better.
- This time he asked for you.

219
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,066
I want to know why.

220
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,194
You want to know why.
I can see it's eating you.

221
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,862
And you can't ask Barr,

222
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,281
and the D.A. won't let you
see the evidence.

223
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:04,287
My lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence. All of it.

224
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,421
- So where's your lead investigator?
- About to catch a bus out of town.

225
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,928
Thanks for the coffee, counselor.

226
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,695
You understand you're not just
asking me to look at the evidence.

227
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,573
You're asking me to look
at a cold-blooded killer.

228
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,202
A man I know to be guilty.
A man you want to keep off death row.

229
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,163
And you're asking me
to look at him objectively.

230
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,208
Yes, that is what I'm asking.

231
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,715
I'll do it. On one condition.

232
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,717
Name it.

233
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,222
You have to look
at the victims objectively.

234
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,393
How do you suggest I do that?

235
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,565
- Yes?
- Mr. Farrior?

236
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,734
I'm Helen Rodin.
We spoke on the phone.

237
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,070
Of course.

238
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,739
You said you're defending
the man that ki...

239
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,407
That man.

240
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,911
<i>I represent James Barr, yes.</i>

241
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,081
<i>And you have questions
about my daughter?</i>

242
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,250
<i>I</i> do.

243
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,419
<i>What for?</i>

244
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,590
I was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as...

245
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,511
That is to say, who they were as people.
As human beings.

246
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,936
That's a bit unusual,
considering your position, isn't it?

247
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,271
That is true.

248
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,108
<i>Normally someone in my position
would want the jury</i>

249
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,610
<i>to know as little as possible about the...</i>

250
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,613
<i>The people that your client killed.</i>

251
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,949
<i>In cold blood.</i>

252
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,874
Have you spoken
with the other families?

253
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:57,085
Yeah, some.
The ones who would speak with me.

254
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,888
Come in.

255
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,306
Thank you.

256
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,593
<i>Chrissie was a nanny.</i>

257
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,887
She had a little girl with her that clay.

258
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,264
Yes, I know.

259
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,602
Are you gonna go talk with that child?

260
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,604
No, of course not. I...

261
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:23,773
Why not?

262
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,735
- Well, I think it would be...
- Insensitive?

263
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,446
Inappropriate?

264
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,618
Everything that you want to know
about my daughter

265
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:38,955
is right here.

266
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,293
<i>The Gazette did</i> a <i>nice piece on her.</i>

267
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,756
Her obituary does the rest.

268
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:54,429
Thank you. I'll definitely have a look.

269
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,182
You a good attorney, Miss Rodin?

270
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,477
- That's not really for me to...
- Just

271
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,270
answer the question.

272
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,816
Yes, I suppose I am pretty good.

273
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,985
Good enough to keep
that man off death row?

274
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,488
You know,

275
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,281
I think maybe I should go.

276
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,991
You stay where you are.

277
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,665
That man deserves to die, Miss Rodin.

278
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,962
Why would you defend him?

279
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,174
I can see
that I have made a terrible mistake.

280
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:36,346
And I'm very, very sorry
and I promise I won't bother you again.

281
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,150
Hello, Dad.

282
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,568
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,195
What am I... What?

284
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,404
Is it true?

285
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,570
You're talking to the victims' families?
You? Alone?

286
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,618
How do you know that?
How did you find me here?

287
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,995
I'm the District Attorney.
It's my business to know.

288
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,122
That's not an answer.

289
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:06,376
Well, you're not the only one
with crack investigators, Helen.

290
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,212
That's right. I know about Reacher.

291
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,881
Your lead investigator is a war veteran

292
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,551
who's been missing
for the last two years.

293
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,512
How can you vouch
for his state of mind?

294
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:18,888
How can you trust anything he tells you?

295
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,223
You don't know the man.

296
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,561
Tell me this,
does he know you can't pay him?

297
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,063
That your own firm
didn't want this case?

298
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,399
That nobody wants this case?

299
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,361
You never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma.

300
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,170
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.
Listen, I'm speaking as your father.

301
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,324
Whatever our differences
have been in the past,

302
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,076
you gotta listen to me now.

303
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,414
You're making a terrible mistake.

304
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,250
You cannot win this case.

305
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:51,254
You're going to ruin your career.
Why? For what?

306
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,258
To hurt me? To change me?

307
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,093
- Helen...
- Don't touch me!

308
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,940
Thanks for letting me take a look.

309
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,151
Hey. We love it
when friends of the accused

310
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:14,903
try to tear our work to shreds.

311
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,446
He's not my friend.

312
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,616
So you keep saying. Find any holes?

313
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,118
Well, you didn't have to
put him in the hospital.

314
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:26,289
Other than that, damn fine police work.
It's open and shut.

315
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,043
What can I say?
The scene was a gold mine.

316
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:33,630
Come on. Now we both know
gold's only as good as the man digging.

317
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:36,633
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come
back, take a look at this stuff...

318
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,468
No, thanks. Don't need to.

319
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,345
You never took any notes.

320
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:42,972
I don't need to.

321
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,144
So you were some real hot shit
in the Army, huh?

322
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,104
I did all right.

323
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,149
So what does an Army cop do mostly?
Break up bar fights?

324
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,653
I did what you do pretty much,
with one minor difference.

325
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:57,862
What's that?

326
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,657
Every suspect was a trained killer.

327
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:02,951
Thanks again.

328
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,000
Why do you think he paid for parking?

329
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:14,629
Pardon?

330
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:18,508
He's about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers.

331
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,010
And he's worried about the meter maid?

332
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,845
"Simple loony" won't do it for you?

333
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,181
I like to have
at least one alternate theory.

334
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:29,519
Habit.

335
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,521
Muscle memory.

336
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,190
I don't think he knew he was doing it.

337
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,569
Like I said, it's damn fine work.

338
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,862
Hey, Army.

339
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,533
What's the serial number on the rifle?

340
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,110
What's the date on the quarter?

341
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,418
1968.

342
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,548
Forest for the trees, Detective.

343
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,551
Forest for the trees.

344
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,251
Mind if I share your table?

345
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,296
I'm Sandy.

346
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,466
So was I. Last week.

347
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,302
On a beach, in Florida.

348
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,432
What's your name?

349
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:34,811
Jimmie Reese.

350
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,440
You don't look like a Jimmie.

351
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:40,525
What do I look like?

352
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,321
I don't know. But not a Jimmie.

353
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,783
So you're new in town?

354
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:50,868
Usually.

355
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,329
It's kind of loud in here.

356
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,667
Do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter? I have a car.

357
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,335
You're old enough to drive?

358
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,630
I'm old enough to do a lot of things.

359
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,508
I'm on a budget, Sandy.

360
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,135
What?

361
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:08,678
I can't afford you.

362
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,388
I'm not a hooker.

363
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,015
Then I really can't afford you.

364
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,852
Seriously, I work at the auto parts store.

365
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:20,523
What I mean is, the cheapest woman
tends to be the one you pay for.

366
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,527
I am not a hooker!

367
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,195
No. A hooker would get the joke.

368
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,365
- What's this?
- He called me a whore.

369
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,579
Is that true?

370
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:42,044
Well, nobody said whore.
She inferred hooker, but I meant slut.

371
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,046
Hey. That's our sister.

372
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,382
Is she a good kisser?

373
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,385
Hey. Outside.

374
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,221
Pay your check first.

375
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,389
I'll pay later.

376
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,058
You won't be able to.

377
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,560
You think?

378
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,228
All the time. You should try it.

379
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,856
It's a great joke,
but I'm going to beat your ass.

380
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,691
Do you want to do that here or outside?

381
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:10,239
Outside.

382
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,203
Stay here, Sandy.

383
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,206
I don't mind the sight of blood.

384
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,918
When it means
you're not pregnant, anyway.

385
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,605
You still think you're funny now, creep?

386
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,274
Shut your mouth, Sandy!
No one is talking to you.

387
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,242
It's your last chance to walk away.

388
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:57,954
Are you kidding? It's five against one.

389
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:00,957
It's three against one.

390
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,293
How do you figure?

391
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:07,255
Well, once I take out the leader,
which is you,

392
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:11,133
I'll have to contend
with one or two enthusiastic wingmen.

393
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,637
The last two guys, they always run.

394
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,514
You've done this before?

395
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,099
Yeah.

396
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,519
It's getting late.

397
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,273
Remember,

398
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,441
you wanted this.

399
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,992
It's okay. You're okay.

400
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:37,076
Get up.

401
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,337
Okay.

402
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,131
Now we know who's who.

403
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,799
Let's get this done.

404
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,692
Really?

405
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,364
Shit!

406
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,707
On the ground!

407
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,835
That's a pretty impressive
response time, fellas.

408
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,210
Do it!

409
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,553
Hands behind your back.

410
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:41,891
Who hired you?

411
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,227
Let's go.

412
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,203
Hey, Helen.

413
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,246
Am I wearing too much perfume?

414
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:08,250
Breathing too sternly.
Detective Emerson.

415
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,128
- Somebody dead?
- And if someone is?

416
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,092
Then they died of shame.
'Cause I was being gentle.

417
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:19,470
I'm starting to understand
why you move around a lot, Reacher.

418
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,555
So no one's dead.

419
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,433
One guy
likely won't ever walk right again.

420
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,936
- You want to charge me.
- Very much.

421
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,270
But no one's pressing.

422
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,147
Sadly, no.

423
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,236
Am I free to go?

424
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,948
Hey, Emerson.

425
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,621
4862681.

426
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:48,457
What's that?

427
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:51,585
It's the serial number on Barr's rifle.

428
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,301
You're working for me,
do you understand that?

429
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:03,514
So everything you do
is a reflection on my firm. On me.

430
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,640
I was set up.

431
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:05,933
You're talking to a lawyer.

432
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,894
There was this girl. She came onto me.
Picked a fight.

433
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,604
Which never happens in a bar.

434
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,773
She was thrown
when I told her my name.

435
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,100
She was expecting Mike Tyson?

436
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,818
She wasn't expecting Jimmie Reese.

437
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,613
Yankees second baseman.

438
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,116
Why did you say you were
a Yankees second baseman?

439
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,994
I always use Yankees second basemen.

440
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,330
I didn't say I was a Yankees
second baseman, I just said...

441
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,001
Look, the point is,

442
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,003
she was expecting to hear
"Jack Reacher."

443
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,296
She knew who I was.

444
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,339
And the cops were rolling
before the fight even started.

445
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:40,342
And those five guys are her brothers?
Come on.

446
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:44,013
Someone sent those boys
to put me down.

447
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:47,349
Who?

448
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,521
If someone followed you
at the river today,

449
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,398
it was probably a cop.
And I highly doubt...

450
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:55,983
There are three things cops never do.

451
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,736
They don't vote Democrat,
they don't drive Cadillacs,

452
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,988
and they never use personal vehicles.

453
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,491
It's not a cop.

454
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,743
A P.l., then, or the D.A.'s office.

455
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,667
You think your father's office
would set me up?

456
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:08,996
Why would anyone set you up?

457
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,331
How was your day?

458
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,874
It went exactly the way I think

459
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,668
you hoped it would.

460
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:17,797
You Okay?

461
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:22,676
What'd you learn?

462
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,182
<i>Chrissie Farrior was 22.</i>

463
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,187
<i>A nanny caring for the six-year-old
daughter of family friends.</i>

464
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,274
She'd finally saved enough
money for a trip to China,

465
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,485
in fact, she should have left
the week before.

466
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,031
<i>But the girl she cared for wanted
Chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday.</i>

467
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,536
<i>They'd gone downtown that day
to shop for a party dress.</i>

468
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:56,210
<i>Rita Coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the River Cross Plaza.</i>

469
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,755
She was usually late for work,
but she had a good reason.

470
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,341
<i>Since her son Marco
was nine years old</i>

471
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:06,428
<i>she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went.</i>

472
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,681
<i>But her dedication had paid off.</i>

473
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:11,559
<i>Marco was now an honor student.</i>

474
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,853
<i>As a reward for all his hard work,</i>

475
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,105
<i>Rita was taking him
to his first baseball game.</i>

476
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:20,192
<i>And she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon.</i>

477
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,239
<i>Nancy Holt's last words to her husband
were a lie.</i>

478
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,157
- I love you, babe. See you!
- Bye.

479
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:29,076
She told him she was
taking her car to be serviced,

480
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,412
but in fact, she was headed downtown.

481
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:35,624
It's perfect.

482
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,788
<i>She told the clerk she didn't want the
purchase showing up on her credit card.</i>

483
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:42,006
<i>She wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary</i>

484
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,509
<i>- just a few days away.
- Thank you.</i>

485
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:51,098
<i>Oline Archer never liked
her husband's construction business,</i>

486
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:55,936
<i>even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county.</i>

487
00:39:56,437 --> 00:40:00,482
<i>So it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit</i>

488
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,359
<i>were forcing them
to sell to the competition.</i>

489
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,611
Rob?

490
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,571
Help! Help!

491
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,201
<i>Her husband
had given his life for the company.</i>

492
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,121
<i>But now that it was hers,</i>

493
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,665
<i>she couldn't bring herself to let it go.</i>

494
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:24,965
<i>She was on her way
to secure a loan that day</i>

495
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:28,302
<i>so she could keep the business
she'd always hated.</i>

496
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:31,472
<i>Darren Sawyer was
an investment broker</i>

497
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,641
<i>in the same building where Rita worked.</i>

498
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:36,977
<i>His wife said
he'd grown increasingly distant of late.</i>

499
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:41,857
<i>She can't remember their last words
to one another, but they weren't kind.</i>

500
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,568
<i>Darren's body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses</i>

501
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,654
<i>he'd bought that morning</i>

502
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,157
<i>and his wife takes comfort
in the fact that, in his last moments,</i>

503
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,826
<i>he was most likely thinking of her.</i>

504
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,890
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

505
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,350
We're gonna be okay.

506
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:18,435
We're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay,

507
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,120
we're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay.

508
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,118
So what'd you learn?

509
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,037
You want me to say you were right.

510
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,998
You want me to say
that this isn't the fight.

511
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,709
James Barr should die.

512
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,294
Maybe he should.

513
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,346
I meant, what did you
learn about the victims.

514
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:47,423
What more do you want?

515
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,717
They were five innocent people
senselessly murdered.

516
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,802
I'm sorry.
Could you please put a shirt on?

517
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,387
This is my shirt.

518
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:55,931
You lose your luggage?

519
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,599
I don't have any luggage.

520
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,561
What was I saying?

521
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:03,230
- Five innocent people.
- Murdered at random, yes.

522
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,986
You know how many people
die in this country every year?

523
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,612
Two and a half million.

524
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:13,073
That means every day,

525
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,994
roughly 7,000 average Americans
wake up for the last time.

526
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,372
Last Friday, five of them converged
on a single spot and died together.

527
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:21,498
Is that random?

528
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:23,000
What else would you call it?

529
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,336
Well, take Darren and Nancy.
Odds are they were having an affair.

530
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,421
Excuse me?

531
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:30,215
You don't buy roses
for your wife on the way to work.

532
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,009
<i>You buy them on the way home.</i>

533
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:35,679
And you don't worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card

534
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:37,473
when your anniversary is that weekend.

535
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,808
<i>Unless it's the gift you're hiding.</i>

536
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,897
And that's why she kept walking

537
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:49,276
while everyone else ran.

538
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:50,861
You can't prove that.

539
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:54,448
How hard would it be?
Cell phones, e-mails.

540
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,494
All it takes is someone willing to dig.

541
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:00,704
What's your point exactly?

542
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:04,291
My point is that two of the victims
weren't there strictly by chance.

543
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:08,128
I need a list of Barr's known associates.

544
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:10,380
There isn't one. He didn't have any.

545
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,633
He's a classic loner.
He didn't even talk to his neighbors.

546
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:15,135
He was a quiet man.
Never bothered anyone.

547
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:16,553
Yeah, exactly.

548
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:19,807
- You have his credit card statement?
- I can get it. Why?

549
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,184
I need the list
of all the places he hung out.

550
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,728
Bars, bowling alleys, strip clubs,

551
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,605
gun ranges.

552
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,524
Anywhere someone
would remember him.

553
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:29,775
What do we hope to find?

554
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:32,027
I need some sleep.

555
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,655
You, too.

556
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:36,805
You don't really think I'm gonna...

557
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,499
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.

558
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,255
Yep. Absolutely.

559
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:32,713
Who's with you?

560
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,381
What happened?

561
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:37,217
That's him, isn't it?

562
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,386
I ain't seeing you, man!

563
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,305
Relax. What happened?

564
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,184
Barr's attorney hired an investigator.

565
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:48,395
Name of Reacher.
Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.

566
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,564
He was in Baghdad
the same time as Barr.

567
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,399
So?

568
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:56,236
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.

569
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,198
Then he shows up at the river today.
Then up on the highway.

570
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:01,074
Almost like he knew something.

571
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,578
And you said we don't like
people asking questions.

572
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,079
No, we sure don't.

573
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,664
So I took steps.

574
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,751
You took steps.

575
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,253
Local people. My guys.

576
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,172
And it blew back on you.

577
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,799
I figured five guys would do it.

578
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,928
This franchise was yours to manage.

579
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:24,097
That's all. Maintenance is our thing,
you understand?

580
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,224
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!

581
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:26,428
Well, that's how this works.

582
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:27,768
Well, I had to make a decision!

583
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:30,562
- These locals, I want their names.
- It's in the file.

584
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:31,931
Any of them know who you are?

585
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,982
Just one, but I took care of it.

586
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:36,443
You...

587
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,446
- Where's the body?
- It's distributed.

588
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:41,615
Relax! No one's gonna find it.

589
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:44,034
- Suppose we want it found, yeah?
- Why the hell would you want it found?

590
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,120
'Cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done.

591
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:48,956
Clean!

592
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:51,083
A missing person isn't clean.

593
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,691
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill
one goddamn person.

594
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,190
You tapped five! You call that clean?

595
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:59,341
I call it done. They're looking
at the shooter, not the target.

596
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:00,634
Jesus.

597
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:04,680
We make it messy now
so it won't get messy later.

598
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:07,975
And we don't leave
questions unanswered ever.

599
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:11,144
Okay, all right. Okay. I can fix this.

600
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:13,897
- Open your eyes.
- No, I ain't seeing you!

601
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,983
It makes no difference now.

602
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,994
I made a mistake.

603
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:29,746
I mean, you can still use me,
just tell me how to fix...

604
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:33,667
To survive.
Don't say "fix it," because you can't.

605
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:37,004
We covered up the one mess.
You made another.

606
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,839
All right. You're right.

607
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,382
You're right.
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

608
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,176
Just tell me what I have to do.

609
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:46,930
I was in prison in Siberia.

610
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:51,018
I spent my first winter
wearing a dead man's coat.

611
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:53,520
A hole in one pocket.

612
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:55,856
I chewed these fingers off

613
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:59,026
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene.

614
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:05,032
These I gave up
to avoid working in the sulfur mine.

615
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:09,870
That is how I survived
when so many others did not.

616
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:14,541
A man this rare can always be of use.

617
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:19,046
So show me. Show me you are rare.

618
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,299
Show me you'll do anything to survive.

619
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:25,344
I don't understand.

620
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:28,388
The fingers from your left hand.

621
00:47:53,747 --> 00:47:57,209
Have you... Have you got a knife?

622
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:00,003
Did I have a knife in Siberia?

623
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:06,343
No... Come on, you've got to be kidding.

624
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,512
You can do it.

625
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,263
Show me.

626
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:43,463
Christ!

627
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,758
Can't! I can't.

628
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,010
Always the bullet.

629
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,720
- I can't!
- I don't understand.

630
00:48:57,978 --> 00:48:59,646
What do we do about the soldier?

631
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,898
What we always do.

632
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,657
Barr's credit card statement.
Eyewitness testimonies.

633
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:14,161
Coffee. You take it black, right?

634
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:22,502
Yeah. What can I say?
I take my work home.

635
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:38,935
Afraid Barr's credit card
statement's a dead end.

636
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,899
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.
Pretty much just gas and groceries.

637
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:49,446
I need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here.

638
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,532
Limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards.

639
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:53,950
Sure, if you tell me why.

640
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,536
Barr consistently filled
his tank on Saturday,

641
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,871
and again on Sunday.

642
00:49:57,954 --> 00:49:59,594
He took a long drive
almost every weekend.

643
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:01,917
- He could be going anywhere.
- Yes.

644
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:06,046
And if it's bars, bowling alleys
or strip clubs, we'll never find it.

645
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:09,466
But a Match-level gun range?
There might be two.

646
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:13,386
And he made his own bullets.
That means he shot a lot.

647
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:15,889
I'm guessing every Saturday.

648
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:18,433
Maybe with a friend.

649
00:50:18,642 --> 00:50:21,311
Why is it so important
you talk to his friends?

650
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:22,479
Assuming he had any.

651
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:24,231
Drop me at the auto parts store.

652
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:26,149
I... Wait. Which one?

653
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,777
I don't know.
She just said "the auto parts store."

654
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,861
She? Who?

655
00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:31,488
Reacher, can you be
a little more specific?

656
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,907
I didn't say "an auto parts store."

657
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:37,536
Which one stands out in your mind
as the auto parts store?

658
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:48,755
You want me to wait?

659
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,759
- No, I'll meet you back at the office later.
- How will you get there?

660
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:58,014
I'll hitch a ride.

661
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,808
Can I help you?

662
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:43,184
Sandy work here?

663
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,521
What's this about?

664
00:51:47,314 --> 00:51:49,816
So she does, thanks.
I need to speak with her.

665
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,318
It's a personal matter.

666
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:54,779
- She's on the clock.
- Legal personal matter.

667
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,073
What are you, a cop?

668
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,243
Call her out, Gary.

669
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:02,912
- I'm gonna need to see some I.D.
- Go get Sandy.

670
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:05,498
Well, I need to see something.

671
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,627
How about the inside of an ambulance?

672
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,633
Okay, I'm calling the police.

673
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:19,346
I don't think Sandy wants
the police involved...

674
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:20,680
- Hello?
- ...but let's ask.

675
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:21,973
Hey! You...

676
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:25,185
Hello? I need some help.
Hello? Hey! You!

677
00:52:26,353 --> 00:52:29,230
No. You are not allowed
back in here, man!

678
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:36,488
Shit.

679
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,201
You know this guy?

680
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:42,535
Tell him.

681
00:52:43,787 --> 00:52:45,163
Give us a few, Gary.

682
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,928
Listen, I wasn't... I didn't know.

683
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:02,597
I didn't know that was going to happen!

684
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:09,437
It was Jeb.

685
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:12,232
The big guy-

686
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:14,234
Jeb Oliver.

687
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:21,533
He told me you were a predator.
You were supposed to start groping me.

688
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:29,499
Just don't hurt me.

689
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,085
Sandy, sit down.

690
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,214
Where can I find Jeb?

691
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,436
I don't know.
He didn't come to work today.

692
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,759
So he works here.

693
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,428
Yeah.

694
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:45,432
It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.

695
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:46,975
His address, write it down.

696
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,771
I'm really sorry, mister.

697
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:55,442
You were supposed to be a pervert.

698
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,112
And it was an easy 100 bucks.

699
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:00,447
That's all?

700
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:06,536
When Jeb asks, you do what he says.

701
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,459
Am I in trouble?

702
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:17,297
Not if you lend me your car.

703
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:20,508
- I don't have a car.
- Well, sure you do. It's outside.

704
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:22,624
I'm guessing you're the Camaro.

705
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:25,597
That whimsy little pickup
has Gary written all over it. Keys?

706
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:28,141
I can't. It's Jeb's car!

707
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,519
Well, won't he be surprised
when I drive it home for him.

708
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:39,986
Who are you, mister?

709
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:41,654
Really?

710
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:51,080
I'm just a guy
who wants to be left alone.

711
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:53,124
I get off work at six!

712
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,379
Maybe we could...

713
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,507
Sandy, listen.

714
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:03,968
Now, you seem like a sweet girl.

715
00:55:04,928 --> 00:55:06,262
You're pretty.

716
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:08,765
You're obviously sharp,

717
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:10,517
doing Gary's books for him.

718
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:13,770
You don't have to
let these guys use you.

719
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:19,359
It's just what girls like me do.

720
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:24,656
You got money?

721
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,033
A little.

722
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:29,869
Get out of town for a couple of days.

723
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,371
Why?

724
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,542
Get out of town, Sandy.

725
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:21,296
Is Jeb home?

726
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:30,305
I have a warrant to search the premises.

727
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:37,770
I see.

728
00:56:39,856 --> 00:56:41,441
Well, if you don't mind...

729
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:51,362
Get him! Get him! Get him!

730
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:01,789
I got this!

731
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:02,874
Okay, okay.

732
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,501
All right.

733
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:06,687
Don't move.

734
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:08,689
I'll tell you what.

735
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:11,984
When I move, you pull the trigger.

736
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,532
- Where's Jeb?
- He's not here.

737
01:00:17,657 --> 01:00:18,950
Where can I find him?

738
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,618
Jesus! My hand!

739
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:22,942
Well, you shouldn't play with guns.
Where can I find him?

740
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:26,040
You're the one driving his car. You tell...

741
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:28,960
The last I saw him,
we was all leaving jail.

742
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:30,628
He said he had to see a guy.

743
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,463
- What guy? Who?
- I don't know.

744
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,965
I don't know, I swear.

745
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:36,551
Next I know,
his mom woke up from a bender

746
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:37,844
and his shit's all gone.

747
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:40,304
Is he the sort to light out like that?

748
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:42,974
No, no, man.
He'd never leave his moms alone.

749
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:44,308
Shit ain't right.

750
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:46,144
- Got a car?
- It's outside.

751
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:47,395
Keys.

752
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,230
My hand, man. They're in my pock...

753
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:50,731
Okay, okay.

754
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:59,240
Now look at your friends.

755
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:01,033
Now look at my face.

756
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,079
Do you ever want to see me again?

757
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:06,914
No way.

758
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:09,917
Am I stealing your car?

759
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:14,213
Use it as long as you like.

760
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,883
You're very kind.

761
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:43,951
<i>I think Jeb Oliver's dead.</i>

762
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:47,371
- Who's Jeb Oliver?
- He was the guy from the bar.

763
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:51,292
Jesus, how hard did you hit him?

764
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:54,462
What? No, not me.

765
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:56,881
No, he was murdered.

766
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,883
And someone tried to make it
look like he left town.

767
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:00,468
Well, maybe he just left town.

768
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,311
You pack your shower curtain
when you travel?

769
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,472
Is this what you base
your conclusions on?

770
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:06,390
What is that on your head?

771
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:14,440
You don't want to know.

772
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:19,403
You said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings.

773
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:25,326
James Barr was a sniper.
Not the best, not the worst.

774
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:27,328
But he trained non-stop for two years.

775
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:28,691
What does training like that do?

776
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,665
What does any training do?

777
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,668
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.
You do without thinking.

778
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:37,338
It also makes people who aren't
necessarily smart seem smart

779
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:39,840
by beating some
tactical awareness into them.

780
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:42,343
Now, 99% of the evidence
your father has against Barr

781
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,011
didn't exist in Baghdad,

782
01:02:44,095 --> 01:02:47,014
not because Barr was smart,
but because he was trained.

783
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:51,269
<i>See, from that garage,
the shooter had the sun in his eyes.</i>

784
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:54,522
<i>Targets were moving left and right.
It's difficult conditions for any sniper.</i>

785
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:57,275
But Baghdad, you said Barr
was in a parking garage then.

786
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,027
Because in Baghdad,
the sun's behind him.

787
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:03,030
<i>Targets coming straight ahead,
single file.</i>

788
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:05,866
Ideal conditions
for even an average shooter

789
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:08,703
and the exact same conditions

790
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:11,205
<i>he would've had
up on that highway bridge.</i>

791
01:03:12,123 --> 01:03:15,334
<i>Up there, he would never even
have to get out of the van.</i>

792
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:18,337
<i>No parking meter.</i>

793
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:19,547
<i>No camera.</i>

794
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:24,051
<i>No trace evidence left behind.
And his escape is assured.</i>

795
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:25,886
Now, I'm not saying
that he couldn't have killed

796
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:28,389
those people at the river,
but he wouldn't have.

797
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:29,473
Not that way.

798
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:31,058
- So you're saying he's crazy.
- No.

799
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:33,144
Well, what exactly are you saying?

800
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:36,897
Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.
But all of it?

801
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:39,567
Fibers, fingerprints, stray brass,
I mean...

802
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,694
And who the hell pays for parking?

803
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:44,572
Sane or crazy,
that just doesn't make sense.

804
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:49,327
Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him.

805
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,246
That would not explain how Barr,

806
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:57,501
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions, never missed.

807
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:58,836
He did miss.

808
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,421
He did.

809
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:04,759
A pristine bullet,

810
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,179
<i>conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop.</i>

811
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:12,767
The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.

812
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:16,729
And arguably the prosecution's single
most important piece of evidence.

813
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:20,441
If Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.

814
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:22,386
Either way, it doesn't make sense.

815
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,945
If he wanted to get away with it,
he likely would have

816
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:26,697
and if he wanted to get caught,

817
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:29,617
Barr was incapable of such perfection.

818
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:31,704
Or maybe he just got lucky,
six shots out of six.

819
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,954
That's what I was willing to accept,

820
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:35,956
then those guys took a run at me.

821
01:04:36,457 --> 01:04:38,542
Whoever sent them made a mistake.

822
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:41,128
It was just a bar fight.

823
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:42,546
Maybe.

824
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:46,467
Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.

825
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:51,222
Or put me in a coma,
right next to their patsy.

826
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,643
Patsy?

827
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:59,563
It was such a great crime scene.

828
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,649
No one stopped to think
it might be too great.

829
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,275
<i>Not Emerson.</i>

830
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,069
<i>Not your father.</i>

831
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:07,822
<i>Not even Barr's own defense attorney.</i>

832
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,158
<i>But Barr knew I would,</i>

833
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:15,496
no matter how much
I wanted it to be true.

834
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:19,166
That's why he asked for me.

835
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,085
Wait.

836
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:23,504
Are you suggesting...

837
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,798
James Barr is innocent.

838
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:36,976
You can see what this is, can't you?

839
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:39,437
You've got a case in your hands

840
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,689
that may be
the last case you'll ever have

841
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:45,609
and you'll do anything
not to hit the bottom of it.

842
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:48,446
Helen.

843
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:51,323
You know,
you never should have retired.

844
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:53,033
Just, look. Listen.

845
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,618
For all I know, you were
standing at an intersection

846
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:56,182
with a cardboard sign three days ago.

847
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:58,497
And I hired you.
Jesus, my father was right.

848
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,667
- Helen. Helen.
- It makes total sense now.

849
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:03,633
It's the way you live,
the way you move around.

850
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:06,338
You're just not cut out
for the real world, are you?

851
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:07,882
Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?

852
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,247
- Helen.
- Is that what this is?

853
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,301
Look out the window.

854
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:11,802
No, I have work to do.

855
01:06:11,886 --> 01:06:13,179
- And you need to leave.
- Just humor me. Okay.

856
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:14,722
Let go of me.

857
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:18,350
- Would you tell me what you see?
- I see the same

858
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,979
things I see every day.

859
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:24,231
Well, imagine you've never seen it.

860
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:28,736
Imagine you've spent your whole life
in other parts of the world

861
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:31,572
being told every day
you're defending freedom.

862
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,991
And finally
you decide you've had enough.

863
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:38,078
Time to see
what you've given up your whole life for.

864
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:40,831
Maybe get some of that freedom
for yourself.

865
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:44,001
Look at the people.

866
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:47,588
Now tell me which ones are free.

867
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:50,841
Free from debt.

868
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:52,510
Anxiety.

869
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:53,844
Stress.

870
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:55,179
Feat.

871
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:58,933
Failure. Indignity. Betrayal.

872
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:04,438
How many wish they were born
knowing what they know now?

873
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:06,690
Ask yourself how many would do things

874
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:08,442
the same way all over again?

875
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:11,904
And how many would
live their lives like me?

876
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:18,035
Now look at the silver Audi
across the street,

877
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:20,120
the one that's been following me all clay.

878
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:21,789
What does that prove?

879
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:25,292
Here's the tag number.
How long would it take you to run it?

880
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:27,878
At this time of night?
I don't know. An hour?

881
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:29,088
Do it.

882
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:32,383
Do it, and then I'll leave.

883
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:42,810
When?

884
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:50,067
No, this is my problem now.
I'll handle it.

885
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:53,153
Yeah?

886
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:56,407
You're blown.

887
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,159
The lawyer's running the license plates.

888
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:01,996
Yeah. So do it?

889
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:04,748
Done.

890
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,169
Go to this address.

891
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:14,300
All right, let's just say
that Barr didn't do it.

892
01:08:14,425 --> 01:08:16,260
Or did it 'cause someone
put him up to it.

893
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,543
Either way, what have you got?

894
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:18,679
Conspiracy.

895
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,514
Yeah, conspiracy to kill
five random people?

896
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:21,932
There's no motive.

897
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:24,351
- It's ridiculous, right?
- It's grassy knoll ludicrous.

898
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:26,270
No point looking any further.

899
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:27,855
Exactly.

900
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:29,481
Exactly.

901
01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:34,445
What's this?

902
01:08:34,612 --> 01:08:36,697
The motive. Just hold onto it.

903
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:37,990
What are we playing, <i>Clue?</i>

904
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:40,993
Yeah?

905
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:43,704
Give it to me.

906
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,044
Thank you.

907
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,647
You sure
that car was following you all day?

908
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:11,732
As soon as you picked me up. Why?

909
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:21,825
It's registered to a company
called Lebendauer Enterprises.

910
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:35,756
A conspiracy to kill five random people?

911
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:38,592
That's ridiculous.

912
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:42,429
<i>Four.</i>

913
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:45,766
Four random people.

914
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:49,395
To hide one specific target.

915
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:17,089
Someone needed
Oline Archer's construction business.

916
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:22,136
<i>And Oline wouldn't let it go.</i>

917
01:10:32,438 --> 01:10:34,648
It's a convincing theory.

918
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,319
But it's just a theory.

919
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:45,159
The first round is the least accurate.
The snipers call it a cold shot.

920
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:47,494
Meanwhile, your eyewitness
described a pause

921
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:49,955
<i>between the first and second rounds.</i>

922
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:52,958
<i>The one shot where the killer
took his time.</i>

923
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:55,794
<i>And Oline Archer
was the second victim.</i>

924
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:58,672
The one shot that mattered.

925
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:02,176
But it's just a theory.

926
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:05,304
This frame was custom made for Barr.

927
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,056
Whoever chose him
knew about Baghdad

928
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:09,808
and the only one who could have
told him about Baghdad

929
01:11:09,892 --> 01:11:11,435
was Barr himself.

930
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:15,022
He has at least one friend.
A very close one.

931
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:17,691
Now, you find that friend,
you'll find the real shooter.

932
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:19,443
Find the real shooter? Reacher,

933
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:22,362
my job is to present the jury
with reasonable doubt. Period.

934
01:11:22,488 --> 01:11:23,947
What about catching the guys
who really did this?

935
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:26,116
- Catching the guys who did this?
- Bringing them to justice?

936
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,361
- No, I can't take this to court.
- Exposing the truth.

937
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:32,039
Even if I believed Barr is innocent,
it's not my job.

938
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:36,543
I am just a lawyer. I'm not a cop.

939
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:41,715
And frankly, neither are you.

940
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:47,554
I can't do this anymore.

941
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:54,269
Thanks for the coffee, counselor.

942
01:12:30,097 --> 01:12:31,265
Sandy?

943
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:36,270
Wait, it is Sandy, isn't it?

944
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:39,439
Do I know you?

945
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,986
Charlie. Jeb's friend?

946
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:46,280
Oh, come on, don't break my heart.

947
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:48,907
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

948
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,827
Well, we were both pretty wasted.

949
01:12:55,873 --> 01:12:56,874
Yeah.

950
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:01,628
- What, you live here?
- Just up there.

951
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:03,297
No shit.

952
01:13:03,839 --> 01:13:07,009
I just moved in around the back!
How crazy is that?

953
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:08,844
It's Wild.

954
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:09,970
Yeah.

955
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:14,808
Wow! You look great.

956
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:16,977
Thanks.

957
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:21,189
Well, look, you know,
I don't want to keep you, so...

958
01:13:21,315 --> 01:13:22,858
Maybe we can grab a drink sometime.

959
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:24,443
Yeah, maybe.

960
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:27,279
Hey, how about tonight?

961
01:13:28,614 --> 01:13:30,324
I'm meeting some people.

962
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:34,036
Okay. Well, some other time, then.

963
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:35,662
Some other time.

964
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:36,830
Do it here.

965
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:37,998
What?

966
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:21,541
Reacher!

967
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:40,560
There's a gun range in Ohio,
targets out to 700 yards.

968
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:43,730
The only range
that matches your requirements.

969
01:14:48,402 --> 01:14:49,861
You should sleep.

970
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:52,990
You have a long drive tomorrow,

971
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:55,742
and I need to go to city hall
and pull up Oline's legal history.

972
01:14:57,577 --> 01:15:00,747
I wouldn't do that. Not till I get back.

973
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:04,042
If I'm right,
someone killed four random people

974
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:06,294
so no one would look directly at Oline.

975
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:10,173
And if I'm right, just saying her name
could get you killed.

976
01:15:10,257 --> 01:15:13,051
- You saying I should be scared?
- Well, are you smart?

977
01:15:13,552 --> 01:15:14,594
Obviously.

978
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,054
Then don't be scared.

979
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,964
What exactly am I looking for?

980
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:54,634
Someone who could kill that girl
with one punch.

981
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:58,138
Oh, you want the guy in 1109.

982
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:00,474
Ernie Johnson.

983
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,143
You'll see.

984
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:30,272
Out of the car!

985
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:40,073
That's our suspect! Move, move!

986
01:18:01,595 --> 01:18:04,014
Suspect is headed north
on State Route 65.

987
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:05,724
I need backup and air support.

988
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:39,307
Hold up!

989
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,059
All clear!

990
01:24:03,248 --> 01:24:05,917
Oh, God, I just don't believe it.
I don't believe it!

991
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,669
I issued the warrant an hour ago.

992
01:24:07,752 --> 01:24:09,170
According to the victim's boss,

993
01:24:09,254 --> 01:24:10,922
Reacher was seen at her
place of work this morning.

994
01:24:11,172 --> 01:24:12,674
Where he threatened her boss.

995
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:15,760
The car he was driving tonight
belonged to a friend of Jeb Oliver's.

996
01:24:15,843 --> 01:24:16,970
The man he assaulted.

997
01:24:17,178 --> 01:24:18,846
No, those guys assaulted Reacher.

998
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:20,807
Reacher put three more men
in the hospital

999
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,370
this afternoon at Jeb Oliver's place.

1000
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,602
After arriving in Jeb Oliver's car.

1001
01:24:24,686 --> 01:24:26,854
And Jeb hasn't been seen
since he left the hospital.

1002
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:29,607
Helen, if you know where Reacher is,
you need to tell us.

1003
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:31,234
I don't know where he is.
I have not seen him

1004
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:33,778
since he left my office a few hours ago.

1005
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:38,324
- I think she's telling the truth.
- You think, Dad? Fuck you!

1006
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,660
Hey, I told you not to go near him.

1007
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:43,204
You come into my home
and you treat me like I'm an accessory!

1008
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:45,373
- Please! You know...
- All right. All right. Come on. Enough.

1009
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:46,499
- Look, let me handle it.
- I'm not done.

1010
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:47,948
You're both done. Just get out.

1011
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:54,632
This is Helen.

1012
01:24:54,716 --> 01:24:57,302
<i>- I'm guessing the police are there?
- Yep.</i>

1013
01:24:57,385 --> 01:24:59,512
<i>By your response I'm guessing
I have about 30 seconds</i>

1014
01:24:59,596 --> 01:25:00,836
<i>before you hand them the phone.</i>

1015
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:02,223
If that.

1016
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:04,183
<i>If you believe someone
could frame Barr,</i>

1017
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:06,644
<i>you have to believe
they could do the same to me.</i>

1018
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:08,438
I suppose that's possible.

1019
01:25:09,647 --> 01:25:11,649
She was a sweet kid, Helen.

1020
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:14,819
And they killed her because of me.

1021
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:17,822
They want me to run.

1022
01:25:18,865 --> 01:25:19,866
But I won't.

1023
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:22,910
<i>- I'm going to finish this.
- No, thaws not a good idea.</i>

1024
01:25:22,994 --> 01:25:24,037
<i>Listen.</i>

1025
01:25:24,245 --> 01:25:27,290
Two things. One, I...

1026
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,792
I stole your car.

1027
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,462
<i>If you want to end this,</i>

1028
01:25:32,545 --> 01:25:33,921
just hang up the phone
and report it missing.

1029
01:25:34,005 --> 01:25:35,173
And I'll understand.

1030
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,674
And anything else?

1031
01:25:37,342 --> 01:25:39,552
I thought I'd be pushing it
if I mentioned this earlier.

1032
01:25:39,636 --> 01:25:41,512
Now I guess all bets are off.

1033
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:44,766
You need to watch what you say
to Emerson and your father.

1034
01:25:45,016 --> 01:25:46,434
<i>I think one of them is in on it.</i>

1035
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:48,853
All right. Thanks for calling.
I have to go.

1036
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:51,022
<i>Wait. I've been followed from day one.</i>

1037
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,609
Only three people knew I was here.

1038
01:25:54,776 --> 01:25:57,028
<i>Emerson, your father and you.</i>

1039
01:25:58,029 --> 01:25:59,906
<i>You need to ask yourself,</i>

1040
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:01,824
<i>who has the most to lose
if we clear Barr?</i>

1041
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:06,204
<i>Who tried to warn you off me?</i>

1042
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:10,208
<i>Of course, I could be wrong.
If you think I am,</i>

1043
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:11,918
<i>just hand over the phone.</i>

1044
01:26:12,043 --> 01:26:13,544
There's no sense getting any deeper.

1045
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:16,005
Who's that you're talking to?

1046
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:18,424
The office.

1047
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,638
Are we done?

1048
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:24,972
Helen, listen.

1049
01:26:25,473 --> 01:26:26,594
- We need to...
- Good night.

1050
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:45,803
You got some fine shooters here.

1051
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:48,473
Fine as frog's hair.

1052
01:27:48,806 --> 01:27:50,141
Rarer, too.

1053
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:53,895
'Cause most of them fellas out there
can't shoot worth a damn.

1054
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:58,149
You ask them to put
three rounds in the black, well,

1055
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:00,485
they'll suck it.

1056
01:28:02,904 --> 01:28:06,240
- I'm looking for the owner.
- That'd be me. Martin Cash.

1057
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:07,992
Aaron Ward.

1058
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:10,244
What can I do you for,
Mr. Ward? Ward?

1059
01:28:10,328 --> 01:28:13,873
Yeah. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
We sewed in Iraq.

1060
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:15,676
The guy just dropped
off the grid, you know?

1061
01:28:15,917 --> 01:28:17,752
- It happens. Yep.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1062
01:28:17,835 --> 01:28:19,128
Anyway, he was a shooter.

1063
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:20,838
Last I heard, he lived
around here somewhere and I...

1064
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:22,924
When did he get out of the Army?

1065
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,177
Well, I didn't say the Army.

1066
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:29,263
Well, you said you served with him.
You're no jarhead.

1067
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:32,016
Man on a flying horse could see that.

1068
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,268
Well, my father was in the Corps,
if that helps.

1069
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:37,355
Well, that makes you half human.

1070
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,149
Your friend got a name?

1071
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:42,401
Yeah. James Barr.

1072
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:45,029
James Barr.

1073
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:46,906
Never heard of him.

1074
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:49,784
I think you have.

1075
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:52,870
I think you've been dreading the moment

1076
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:55,039
some cop comes in here
asking after him.

1077
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:58,042
Because it's for sure
some soccer mom around here

1078
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:02,463
is more worried about your range than
she is about the pool in her backyard

1079
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:05,132
or the drain cleaner under her sink.

1080
01:29:06,717 --> 01:29:10,012
Wouldn't matter to her
if Barr did his killing 100 miles away,

1081
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:12,014
only that he came here to rehearse.

1082
01:29:12,098 --> 01:29:13,683
She'd have a case to shut you down

1083
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:16,727
and nothing better to do.

1084
01:29:17,645 --> 01:29:18,729
What do you want?

1085
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:22,149
I want to know who Barr's friends were.

1086
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,446
Those boys out there,

1087
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:31,492
they're mighty touchy when it comes
to their constitutional rights.

1088
01:29:32,243 --> 01:29:35,746
Suppose I tell them a cop is in here
asking after my members?

1089
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:37,832
- I'm not a cop.
- What are you?

1090
01:29:37,915 --> 01:29:39,000
I work for Barr's attorney.

1091
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,918
We have reason to believe
he's innocent.

1092
01:29:41,002 --> 01:29:42,128
The hell you say.

1093
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:46,924
Be that as it may, I'm the only one
who's bothered to track him this far.

1094
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:51,679
You help me out, I'll be in your debt.

1095
01:29:52,096 --> 01:29:53,097
And if I don't?

1096
01:29:55,266 --> 01:29:57,143
Maybe you can coach soccer.

1097
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:04,942
You put three in the center
and maybe we'll talk.

1098
01:30:07,695 --> 01:30:08,988
Can I have a few to warm up?

1099
01:31:33,072 --> 01:31:34,824
Six inches right.

1100
01:31:35,366 --> 01:31:38,869
That's your mulligan, Mr. Ward.
Play ball!

1101
01:31:39,787 --> 01:31:41,122
Let's go.

1102
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:28,669
You're a little rusty, Mr. Reacher.

1103
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:33,716
I saw a man by that name
shoot for the Wimbledon Cup,

1104
01:32:33,799 --> 01:32:35,426
what, ten years ago.

1105
01:32:35,926 --> 01:32:38,888
And I'm pretty sure you never
played second base for the Yankees

1106
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:41,098
in 1925.

1107
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:43,601
Now,

1108
01:32:44,602 --> 01:32:46,103
I'll answer one question.

1109
01:32:47,188 --> 01:32:48,522
Who's your best shooter?

1110
01:32:50,024 --> 01:32:51,275
James Barr.

1111
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:57,490
I pulled all these down
as soon as I heard about the shooting.

1112
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,497
That's the best shot

1113
01:33:04,622 --> 01:33:06,791
I ever seen this side of civilian life.

1114
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:12,213
Suppose I told you Barr wasn't this
good on his best day in the Army.

1115
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:15,382
I handed out those targets myself.
That's my scrawl on every one.

1116
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:17,468
Do you hang them downrange, too?

1117
01:33:17,802 --> 01:33:19,470
What, are you serious?

1118
01:33:20,137 --> 01:33:22,973
I'm saying
it's possible that Barr had a friend.

1119
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,030
One who switched the targets
on the range.

1120
01:33:25,059 --> 01:33:26,393
Maybe Barr let him.

1121
01:33:26,644 --> 01:33:29,814
Made him feel like King Shit
having his name up on your wall.

1122
01:33:29,897 --> 01:33:34,318
I never saw one real shooter
who would do that for his own mother.

1123
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:38,823
Unless he was framing his mother
for multiple murder

1124
01:33:40,157 --> 01:33:41,992
and using your range to do it.

1125
01:33:45,329 --> 01:33:47,456
Barr didn't come alone, did he?

1126
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,586
You know, one of these nuts is likely
to kill you, they find that camera, there.

1127
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:53,879
Hell, the camera's there

1128
01:33:53,963 --> 01:33:56,257
'cause one of these nuts
is likely to kill me.

1129
01:33:58,259 --> 01:33:59,468
There's Barr.

1130
01:34:00,511 --> 01:34:02,763
I always liked him. Always liked him.

1131
01:34:02,847 --> 01:34:03,848
There.

1132
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:06,142
Him.

1133
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,564
That son of a bitch.

1134
01:34:17,528 --> 01:34:19,029
Helen Rodin speaking.

1135
01:34:19,113 --> 01:34:20,781
<i>Got a candidate for our shooter.</i>

1136
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:23,367
Picture, possible prints

1137
01:34:23,868 --> 01:34:25,870
and one pissed-off eyewitness.

1138
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:27,580
I can't talk right now.

1139
01:34:28,706 --> 01:34:30,207
Just give me three hours to get back.

1140
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:32,376
<i>And don't talk to anyone until I get there.</i>

1141
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:34,295
I'll look into that, thanks.

1142
01:34:35,713 --> 01:34:38,048
This is just
what I could pull this morning.

1143
01:34:38,299 --> 01:34:42,303
Tax records, city and state
permit applications, contract bids.

1144
01:34:42,386 --> 01:34:44,096
Shell corporation in Georgia.

1145
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:46,557
That's the one next to Russia,
not Florida.

1146
01:34:47,308 --> 01:34:51,061
They work one city at a time,
acquiring a local construction concern

1147
01:34:51,312 --> 01:34:53,147
just ahead of major civic redevelopment.

1148
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:57,067
They build bridges no one needs.
Highways no one uses.

1149
01:34:57,401 --> 01:35:01,906
They're like a cancer.
A cell that won't stop growing.

1150
01:35:03,574 --> 01:35:07,077
They moved 12 times in 15 years.
Atlanta, Albuquerque,

1151
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:09,997
Austin, Oklahoma City, Sacramento.

1152
01:35:10,414 --> 01:35:13,250
Always amidst allegations of corruption

1153
01:35:13,334 --> 01:35:16,837
including millions of dollars
in missing public funds.

1154
01:35:16,921 --> 01:35:21,258
And yet never an investigation.
Never even an inquiry.

1155
01:35:21,759 --> 01:35:25,429
It's as if Lebendauer Enterprises
were above reproach.

1156
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:31,977
Well, maybe that's because

1157
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:35,856
the allegations come
from the competition.

1158
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:38,901
Outbid. Bitter.

1159
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:40,945
Like Oline Archer.

1160
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:44,865
Or maybe Lebendauer
has the cooperation of key officials.

1161
01:35:44,949 --> 01:35:47,868
And maybe
when that cooperation isn't enough,

1162
01:35:48,285 --> 01:35:51,538
they kill people who won't be bought off.
Like Oline Archer.

1163
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:53,791
Helen, how much of this
do you honestly believe?

1164
01:35:53,874 --> 01:35:56,043
It doesn't matter how much I believe.

1165
01:35:56,794 --> 01:35:58,712
It doesn't even matter
how much I can prove.

1166
01:35:58,796 --> 01:36:01,298
It only matters how much is true.

1167
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:03,550
Do you know how delusional you sound?

1168
01:36:04,051 --> 01:36:05,719
What happened to you?

1169
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:10,307
Are you really so set on putting
this man to death that you'd ignore...

1170
01:36:21,652 --> 01:36:24,822
I pulled all of this paper
under my own name.

1171
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:27,658
If Jack Reacher's right,

1172
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:31,495
my life, your daughter's life,

1173
01:36:32,162 --> 01:36:33,998
is in danger now.

1174
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:37,668
Whatever happens to me next
is on your head,

1175
01:36:38,085 --> 01:36:40,045
whether you're involved or not.

1176
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:46,927
You are the District Attorney
and I've given you compelling evidence

1177
01:36:47,011 --> 01:36:48,887
to investigate Lebendauer Enterprises.

1178
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:53,183
Your next move
will tell me which side you're on.

1179
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,438
I see. It's a test.

1180
01:36:58,605 --> 01:37:03,527
Well, this may be hard for you
to believe, but I do love you.

1181
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:08,032
And obviously I'm not
going to turn a blind eye,

1182
01:37:08,115 --> 01:37:10,534
no matter how absurd I find all of this.

1183
01:37:11,869 --> 01:37:15,456
So, if you really believe
that you're in danger,

1184
01:37:15,873 --> 01:37:17,374
if you believe that,

1185
01:37:18,709 --> 01:37:20,794
then the next order of business,

1186
01:37:21,879 --> 01:37:25,049
is to put you
in protective custody right now.

1187
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:30,095
And how safe will I be
if you're part of it?

1188
01:37:30,554 --> 01:37:32,181
Jesus, Helen.

1189
01:38:22,606 --> 01:38:24,149
Hey.

1190
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:34,868
Business meeting or personal?

1191
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,121
Hard to tell them apart.

1192
01:38:37,538 --> 01:38:38,956
I'll bet.

1193
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:42,102
Helen?

1194
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:43,395
<i>No.</i>

1195
01:39:45,105 --> 01:39:46,440
Sorry, wrong number.

1196
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:48,400
<i>Is this Reacher?</i>

1197
01:39:50,777 --> 01:39:51,904
Who is this?

1198
01:39:55,115 --> 01:39:57,451
Is this Reacher?

1199
01:40:02,289 --> 01:40:05,417
It's you. The guy from the car.

1200
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,171
It's your boyfriend.

1201
01:40:10,964 --> 01:40:12,299
Reacher, is it you?

1202
01:40:13,926 --> 01:40:14,927
Helen, are you hurt?

1203
01:40:15,135 --> 01:40:17,175
Well, she's gonna be
if you're not here in one hour.

1204
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:20,015
Do I have to tell you how this works?

1205
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:21,892
You'll bounce me around
to make sure I'm not followed,

1206
01:40:21,975 --> 01:40:24,436
then walk me into
an ambush and kill me.

1207
01:40:24,645 --> 01:40:26,813
<i>Aw, you ruined my surprise.</i>

1208
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:28,774
Well, I can do one better.

1209
01:40:29,274 --> 01:40:31,527
I went down to the gun range
at Hinge Creek.

1210
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:35,447
<i>I got the picture, prints,
and I'm going to the Feds.</i>

1211
01:40:35,614 --> 01:40:37,282
The lawyer's all yours.

1212
01:40:41,787 --> 01:40:42,829
Get the Zec.

1213
01:40:52,297 --> 01:40:54,383
On second thought, I'd like to kill you.

1214
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:56,093
<i>Let's say winner take all.</i>

1215
01:40:56,176 --> 01:40:57,177
Listen to me, you prick.

1216
01:40:57,302 --> 01:40:59,302
I will kill this bitch
if you're not here in one...

1217
01:41:00,681 --> 01:41:01,974
Shit!

1218
01:41:08,355 --> 01:41:09,982
<i>You think I'm a hero?</i>

1219
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:14,027
I am not a hero.
I'm a drifter with nothing to lose.

1220
01:41:14,361 --> 01:41:17,197
You killed that girl to put me in a frame.

1221
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:21,326
I mean to beat you to death
and drink your blood from a boot.

1222
01:41:22,202 --> 01:41:25,914
<i>Now, this is how it's going to work.
You're gonna give me the address</i>

1223
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:28,458
and I'll be along
when I am damn good and ready.

1224
01:41:28,542 --> 01:41:30,794
If she doesn't answer the phone
when I call this number,

1225
01:41:30,877 --> 01:41:32,713
if I even think you've hurt her,

1226
01:41:33,046 --> 01:41:34,548
I disappear.

1227
01:41:34,673 --> 01:41:39,469
And if you're smart, that scares you,
because I'm in your blind spot

1228
01:41:39,553 --> 01:41:41,680
and I have nothing better to do.

1229
01:41:49,896 --> 01:41:50,897
You got a pen?

1230
01:41:53,066 --> 01:41:54,401
Don't need one.

1231
01:42:58,799 --> 01:43:03,303
If I had a dollar for every time
the Army called the Corps for help.

1232
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:07,474
- You have something for me?
- Yeah.

1233
01:43:08,141 --> 01:43:09,601
Here.

1234
01:43:14,106 --> 01:43:15,148
You're kidding, right?

1235
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:16,775
Just because I saw you
shoot ten years ago

1236
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:20,278
doesn't mean I'll let you
kill some asshole with my gun.

1237
01:43:20,487 --> 01:43:22,197
I told you how serious this was.

1238
01:43:22,489 --> 01:43:24,157
And I showed up, didn't I?

1239
01:43:24,991 --> 01:43:26,159
So let's get to it.

1240
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:29,162
<i>Now, your shooter will be</i>

1241
01:43:29,663 --> 01:43:32,749
right up there
behind those lights. Okay?

1242
01:43:32,833 --> 01:43:35,794
He can cover both roads
coming and going.

1243
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:39,673
And kill you
just as soon as you stand up.

1244
01:43:39,798 --> 01:43:40,966
Well, can you take him out?

1245
01:43:41,508 --> 01:43:42,801
What, to dinner you mean?

1246
01:43:44,845 --> 01:43:49,182
Look, I don't know the type of people
you normally associate with, Reacher.

1247
01:43:49,516 --> 01:43:54,521
But I'm not in the habit of driving out
to the boonies at the drop of a hat

1248
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:58,316
and just picking off
some total strangers, all right?

1249
01:43:59,192 --> 01:44:02,028
Anyway, I can't see anything,
not with them lights up.

1250
01:44:02,154 --> 01:44:03,697
So shoot them out.

1251
01:44:04,489 --> 01:44:07,242
Yeah, sure.
And then he knows right where I am.

1252
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:09,327
I might as well set myself on fire.

1253
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:13,248
No, sir. I'll start shooting when he does.

1254
01:44:15,876 --> 01:44:18,003
And how do you propose
we get him started?

1255
01:44:18,545 --> 01:44:22,382
Well, you could always start running.

1256
01:44:29,848 --> 01:44:31,391
What's wrong with your eye?

1257
01:44:31,516 --> 01:44:33,185
I'm saving my night vision.

1258
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:40,400
Hey, Gunny, you mind if I ask you
kind of a personal question?

1259
01:44:40,525 --> 01:44:42,360
What, you don't think
I can shoot anymore?

1260
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:44,696
It is a perishable skill.

1261
01:44:45,572 --> 01:44:46,907
Yeah, well,

1262
01:44:47,532 --> 01:44:49,576
the sun will be up in an hour.

1263
01:44:51,077 --> 01:44:52,412
Let's get going.

1264
01:45:09,429 --> 01:45:11,598
I heard them call you the Zec.

1265
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:13,725
That means "prisoner."

1266
01:45:15,602 --> 01:45:16,770
Yes?

1267
01:45:19,731 --> 01:45:21,107
Tell me, killing all those people,

1268
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:23,360
I have to believe the money
you're making

1269
01:45:23,443 --> 01:45:24,861
can't possibly be enough to just...

1270
01:45:24,945 --> 01:45:26,238
Enough?

1271
01:45:26,446 --> 01:45:28,281
There is no such thing.

1272
01:45:28,615 --> 01:45:30,617
We take what can be taken.

1273
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:32,494
This is what we do.

1274
01:45:34,955 --> 01:45:36,289
And you?

1275
01:45:37,958 --> 01:45:40,585
This one I think I understand, but you?

1276
01:45:41,253 --> 01:45:42,295
Why'd you do it?

1277
01:45:42,629 --> 01:45:44,965
You make it sound like I had a choice.

1278
01:45:45,131 --> 01:45:46,299
On, didn't you?

1279
01:45:49,803 --> 01:45:51,137
You'll see.

1280
01:45:54,975 --> 01:45:58,311
You should know I've taken steps,
that if anything happens...

1281
01:45:58,436 --> 01:46:02,107
If anything happens to you,
it will happen in front of your father

1282
01:46:02,274 --> 01:46:04,276
while he begs for your life.

1283
01:46:06,486 --> 01:46:08,822
You should never have involved him.

1284
01:46:09,155 --> 01:46:12,868
Now you will have to convince him
to forget, for your sake

1285
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:15,203
and for his.

1286
01:46:16,121 --> 01:46:19,791
You say nothing,
but I see defiance in your eyes.

1287
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,336
That is a look I have seen
many, many times.

1288
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:26,006
When the soldier comes,

1289
01:46:26,131 --> 01:46:28,508
when you watch how he dies,
it will change you.

1290
01:46:29,009 --> 01:46:31,219
You will want to forget me then.

1291
01:46:42,022 --> 01:46:43,273
Reacher?

1292
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:44,691
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1293
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:46,151
They're ready for you.

1294
01:46:47,152 --> 01:46:48,737
They'd like to think so.

1295
01:46:49,696 --> 01:46:52,198
Don't do this.
Please don't do this. Not for me.

1296
01:46:52,324 --> 01:46:53,909
<i>Listen, Helen, they're not gonna</i>

1297
01:46:54,034 --> 01:46:57,996
hurt you until they have me.
And that's never going to happen.

1298
01:46:58,204 --> 01:46:59,372
<i>You hear me?</i>

1299
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:01,541
You just hang in there.

1300
01:47:03,376 --> 01:47:05,211
'Cause I'm coming to get you.

1301
01:47:07,005 --> 01:47:08,340
Now say you believe me.

1302
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:11,176
I believe you.

1303
01:47:43,041 --> 01:47:44,876
This was a bad idea.

1304
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:05,397
Any time now, Gunny.

1305
01:48:20,453 --> 01:48:22,080
Shit.

1306
01:48:33,758 --> 01:48:35,260
Where the hell are you, Gunny?

1307
01:52:53,559 --> 01:52:55,228
Suck it!

1308
01:53:06,406 --> 01:53:07,907
You should go.

1309
01:53:51,117 --> 01:53:52,452
Toss it.

1310
01:56:50,922 --> 01:56:52,965
I know you're in there, Emerson.

1311
01:56:56,802 --> 01:56:59,472
It was staring me right in the face.

1312
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:04,644
The one piece that just didn't fit.

1313
01:57:05,478 --> 01:57:06,938
The quarter.

1314
01:57:09,315 --> 01:57:12,276
Nobody would have thought
to dump that meter.

1315
01:57:13,986 --> 01:57:15,488
Not even me.

1316
01:57:58,990 --> 01:58:00,992
You were wrong about my father.

1317
01:58:02,994 --> 01:58:05,121
I wouldn't make a big thing of it.

1318
01:58:22,471 --> 01:58:23,681
Who is he?

1319
01:58:23,806 --> 01:58:25,349
That's John Doe Number Two.

1320
01:58:25,516 --> 01:58:28,686
The man on the grassy knoll.
The thing under the bed.

1321
01:58:29,854 --> 01:58:31,522
They call him the Zec.

1322
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:34,025
Zec? Prisoner.

1323
01:58:35,151 --> 01:58:36,527
What's your real name?

1324
01:58:39,697 --> 01:58:41,449
I was born in October.

1325
01:58:41,532 --> 01:58:43,868
When I get to my birthday,
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

1326
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:46,120
One. Two.

1327
01:58:46,203 --> 01:58:49,832
Chelovek. Zec Chelovek.

1328
01:58:51,542 --> 01:58:53,044
Chelovek?

1329
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:55,212
Chelovek? Human.

1330
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:58,758
Prisoner Human Being.

1331
01:58:59,884 --> 01:59:03,220
- That's your real name?
- That is all I remember.

1332
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:07,850
Call the police.

1333
01:59:11,395 --> 01:59:13,189
Were you really going to shoot him?

1334
01:59:14,899 --> 01:59:16,734
I knew I wouldn't have to.

1335
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:21,739
One look at this guy and you know
he'll do anything to survive.

1336
01:59:22,073 --> 01:59:24,241
One look at me
and you know I'm not bluffing.

1337
01:59:24,533 --> 01:59:27,036
Yes, I have an emergency at...

1338
01:59:27,912 --> 01:59:29,205
Yes, I'll hold.

1339
01:59:32,917 --> 01:59:34,251
We're in no hurry.

1340
01:59:36,879 --> 01:59:39,090
With a name like yours,
you're gonna feel right at home.

1341
01:59:39,423 --> 01:59:42,093
Prison? In America?

1342
01:59:42,593 --> 01:59:46,764
A retirement home.
If I go to prison at all.

1343
01:59:46,889 --> 01:59:48,057
You think you're gonna walk?

1344
01:59:48,265 --> 01:59:50,935
You are a homeless drifter
wanted for murder.

1345
01:59:51,268 --> 01:59:55,606
Meanwhile, I am an old man
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1346
01:59:55,940 --> 02:00:00,027
Thanks to you,
who is left to say otherwise? Who?

1347
02:00:00,111 --> 02:00:03,948
Yes, hello? Yes, there's...
I have an emergency.

1348
02:00:04,073 --> 02:00:06,117
We'll see which one of us
goes to prison.

1349
02:00:06,283 --> 02:00:08,786
There are maybe
three, four people dead.

1350
02:00:10,329 --> 02:00:11,789
- Okay.
- My bet?

1351
02:00:13,457 --> 02:00:14,834
Neither one.

1352
02:00:17,962 --> 02:00:19,505
What did you do?

1353
02:00:23,968 --> 02:00:25,511
What's it look like?

1354
02:00:27,304 --> 02:00:28,305
What about the truth?

1355
02:00:28,806 --> 02:00:31,225
What about getting the guys
who really did this?

1356
02:00:31,308 --> 02:00:33,310
What about bringing him to justice?

1357
02:00:34,478 --> 02:00:36,105
I just did.

1358
02:00:43,654 --> 02:00:46,782
What about clearing Barr?
What about clearing you?

1359
02:00:46,991 --> 02:00:48,617
I have faith you'll sort it out.

1360
02:00:48,701 --> 02:00:50,494
And I hear you have an in
with the local D.A.

1361
02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:52,872
But what happens to you
in the meantime?

1362
02:00:52,997 --> 02:00:54,832
I keep moving. Same as always.

1363
02:00:54,957 --> 02:00:57,126
Wait, is that my car?

1364
02:01:04,133 --> 02:01:05,134
This the lady?

1365
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:08,179
Helen Rodin, Martin Cash.

1366
02:01:08,512 --> 02:01:09,638
A pleasure.

1367
02:01:11,015 --> 02:01:13,184
You look like hell there, Army.

1368
02:01:13,309 --> 02:01:16,979
You asked if I was afraid
I'd end up like Barr. I'm not.

1369
02:01:17,188 --> 02:01:19,023
I'm afraid I'll end up like this guy.

1370
02:01:19,148 --> 02:01:21,942
There's a lot of dead bodies out here.
So let's get to it.

1371
02:01:22,026 --> 02:01:24,862
- We should probably go.
- Wait. That's it?

1372
02:01:25,362 --> 02:01:26,530
It's just over?

1373
02:01:27,656 --> 02:01:29,366
You'll be all right, counselor.

1374
02:01:29,533 --> 02:01:32,203
No. What if I need you?
How will I find you?

1375
02:01:32,495 --> 02:01:33,704
You don't need me.

1376
02:01:35,331 --> 02:01:36,665
Not anymore.

1377
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:40,544
Get her number. Let's go!

1378
02:01:57,061 --> 02:01:59,063
I'm Helen Rodin, your attorney.

1379
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:03,859
This conversation is protected
by attorney-client privilege.

1380
02:02:03,943 --> 02:02:04,944
You understand what that means?

1381
02:02:05,069 --> 02:02:06,028
Yeah.

1382
02:02:06,111 --> 02:02:08,405
Now, the police didn't
talk to you, did they?

1383
02:02:08,572 --> 02:02:10,413
They're not allowed
to do that without me here.

1384
02:02:14,411 --> 02:02:16,080
How bad was it?

1385
02:02:18,082 --> 02:02:19,416
How many did I...

1386
02:02:20,584 --> 02:02:22,628
You don't remember
anything about the incident?

1387
02:02:26,215 --> 02:02:27,258
No.

1388
02:02:28,759 --> 02:02:31,929
But I could hear the nurses
talking to those cops out there.

1389
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:38,269
I don't even remember wanting to do it!

1390
02:02:43,774 --> 02:02:45,109
Look, I'm not gonna fight this.

1391
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:48,946
If they say I done it, then I did.

1392
02:02:49,613 --> 02:02:51,282
I done things before.

1393
02:02:53,951 --> 02:02:55,327
I did something bad.

1394
02:02:57,955 --> 02:02:59,123
Real bad.

1395
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,628
A long time ago.

1396
02:03:08,132 --> 02:03:09,800
And I got away with it.

1397
02:03:17,474 --> 02:03:18,642
James,

1398
02:03:18,976 --> 02:03:20,811
how well do you know this place?

1399
02:03:32,114 --> 02:03:33,490
Pretty well.

1400
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:35,878
And how do you think
you would have done it?

1401
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:40,664
I guess

1402
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:48,672
I would have parked up on the highway.

1403
02:03:49,131 --> 02:03:51,675
The sun would be at my back
that time of day.

1404
02:03:53,344 --> 02:03:54,470
I got a van.

1405
02:03:55,804 --> 02:03:57,473
Set up in back.

1406
02:03:58,182 --> 02:04:00,517
Wouldn't have to worry about my brass.

1407
02:04:02,353 --> 02:04:04,355
Get away real clean, too.

1408
02:04:07,858 --> 02:04:09,860
That sound about right?

1409
02:04:11,362 --> 02:04:13,530
Sounds as if you know your stuff.

1410
02:04:18,494 --> 02:04:19,870
I forget your name.

1411
02:04:20,537 --> 02:04:21,872
It's Helen.

1412
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:24,875
Helen Rodin.

1413
02:04:30,506 --> 02:04:32,675
You're going to be okay, James.

1414
02:04:33,842 --> 02:04:35,552
I am gonna take care of you.

1415
02:04:35,719 --> 02:04:37,221
You can't protect me.

1416
02:04:40,516 --> 02:04:41,850
No one can.

1417
02:04:42,059 --> 02:04:43,394
From what?

1418
02:04:44,853 --> 02:04:45,896
From who?

1419
02:04:47,398 --> 02:04:49,066
There's this guy.

1420
02:04:52,736 --> 02:04:54,238
He's a kind of cop.

1421
02:04:56,198 --> 02:04:57,866
At least he used to be.

1422
02:04:59,076 --> 02:05:01,078
<i>He doesn't care about the law.</i>

1423
02:05:02,746 --> 02:05:04,748
<i>He doesn't care about proof.</i>

1424
02:05:05,874 --> 02:05:07,584
<i>He only cares about what's right.</i>

1425
02:05:07,918 --> 02:05:09,753
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1426
02:05:10,087 --> 02:05:11,588
<i>He knows what I did.</i>

1427
02:05:13,549 --> 02:05:14,550
<i>He knows where I am.</i>

1428
02:05:16,218 --> 02:05:19,096
<i>And this guy, he made me a promise.</i>

1429
02:05:19,388 --> 02:05:20,431
I said, shut your mouth!

1430
02:05:21,598 --> 02:05:23,767
<i>If I ever got in trouble again,</i>

1431
02:05:25,436 --> 02:05:26,770
<i>he'd be there.</i>
