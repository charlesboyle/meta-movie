Look, nigga, I'm gonna be here

903
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,964
Not 10:03, not 10:36.

904
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:19,385
If you ain't got my money or my bud,
I'm killing you and him.

905
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,225
-You're gonna kill me?
-Get the fuck out of my face.

906
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,854
Back, back.

Can I have my chili Fritos?

908
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,318
You can't have shit. I'm closed, fat boy.

909
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,488

-What'd he say?
-Huh?

913
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,627
What'd he say?

914
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,088
Oh, he just said for us to pay him

915
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,006
What you mean "us"?

00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,314
-What did you tell him?
-I just told him we was smoking.

923
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,567
And we was just chilling.

924
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,193
Man, you were smoking.

925
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,779
I smoked half a little piece of joint
with you.

926
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,615
-That fool ain't gonna do nothing.
-What'd he say?

927
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,368
What'd he say?

928
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,124
If we don't pay him by 10:00,

929
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,918
Nigga, we need to pay, he crazy.

00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,546
I can't believe you got me in the mix

931
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,884
I didn't put that joint to your lip,
make you smoke.

932
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,093

934
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,513
Stimulate you mind, man.

949
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:00,546
That's just Debbie from down the street.

00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,383
So? What the hell's she doing in there?

951

-I thought you wanted me to wash your car.
-Hey, man. Wash it later. Stay over there.

975
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,333

That ain't me calling

I'm gonna tell him
you ain't got nothing to do with it.

1034
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,686
I smoked up his weed.

1035
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,398
I'm gonna face the consequences.

1036
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,028
If I get dealt with, I get dealt with.

1037

Hey, Craig, have you seen my shoe--?

1038
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,184
What's that for?

Protection.

1040
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,066
Protection?

1041
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,901
Protection from who?

1042

01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,037
Oh, man.

...if we had known you need a gun

1047
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,919
You know how it is around here.

1048
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,548
Oh, no, son. That's not the way it is.

1049

You keep your ass around this house.

1558
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:32,736
Your supervisor called about your job.
She wants you to call tomorrow.

1559
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,488
-For real?
-Mm-hm.

1560
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,324
Now, Craig...

1561
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,326
...I was proud of you tonight.

1562
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,704
You used your brain.

1563
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:44,331
That's what I want you to do,
use your brain.

1564
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:45,708
That's my boy.

1565
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:48,627
That's my boy.

1566
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,596
Night, Mama.

1567
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,598
MRS. JONES:
Night, baby.

1568
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:08,939

[PHONE RINGS]

1570
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,428
CRAIG:
Hello?

1571
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:41,472
JOI [OVER PHONE]:
Why you can't call nobody back?

1572
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,808
Which one of your hoes
has somebody shooting at you?

1573
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:49,939
See, I don't know why I waste my time
on your old stupid ass anyway.

1574
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:51,607
CRAIG:
I don't know either.

1575
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:52,983
It's over.

1576
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,110
Bitch!

1577
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,909
Yeah, I got your money.

1578
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:05,079
I don't appreciate you sending
your punk-ass, bust-ass...

1579
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:08,666
...Jheri-curl-ass friends
to shoot at me and my homey.

1580
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,168
They like to got dealt with.

1581
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,796
BIG WORM: Don't be calling here
like you some straight up G...

1582
01:33:13,964 --> 01:33:17,341
...because I'll cut your balls off
and hand them to you, partner.

1583
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:20,135
I had to warn you too many times
about my money, Smokey.

1584
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:22,680
It's the principle of the whole thing.

1585
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,599
It's principalities in this.

1586
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,184
Well....

1587
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:30,062
Yeah, hey, I got your money anyway.

1588
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,856
And you sell that shit yourself next time.

1589
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:34,775
Because I'm going to rehab.

1590
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:37,027
I'm through with this shit.

1591
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,207
I was just bullshitting.

1592
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:53,877
And you know this, man.
