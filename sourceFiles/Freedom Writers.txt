1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Freedom Writers

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,731
There have been shots fired.

3
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,825
Total civil unrest is happening
throughout the Los Angeles area.

4
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,904
Dozens of police
are running down the streets.

5
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:38,199
Dozens of police
are running down the streets.

6
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,464
Smoke reigned over the entire city.

7
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,575
We're telling anybody
who's in downtown South Central...

8
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,233
There are 38 dead and more than...

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,504
The EMT are having
a hard time getting in...

10
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,785
...where truck driver Reginald Denny
was pulled from his vehicle...

11
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,417
The city resembles a war zone.

12
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,150
Crowds gathered
at Parker Center downtown.

13
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,250
...here in Hollywood, where
looters have struck many businesses.

14
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,829
There have been 3,600 structural fires.

15
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,361
Thick, black smoke rising
from the countless fires

16
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:11,995
in Hollywood, downtown, Compton,
Watts and Long Beach...

17
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,187
In America,

18
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,457
a girl can be crowned a princess

19
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,763
for her beauty and her grace.

20
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,098
But an Aztec princess
is chosen for her blood...

21
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,565
Eva?

22
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,705
...to fight for her people,
as Papi and his father fought

23
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,441
against those who say
we are less than they are,

24
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,848
who say we are not equal in beauty
and in blessings.

25
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,527
It was the first day of school,

26
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,393
and I was waiting for my father
to take me to the bus.

27
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,727
Roberto!

28
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,271
Eva!

29
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,701
And I saw the war for the first time.

30
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,611
Eva! Eva!

31
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,539
Police! Open up!

32
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,014
They took my father for retaliation.

33
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,817
He was innocent, but they took him,

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,252
because he was respected
by my people.

35
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:40,486
They called my people a gang
because we fight for our America.

36
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,055
On your feet!

37
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,329
When I got my initiation
into the gang life,

38
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,559
I became third generation.

39
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,969
They beat you so you won't break.

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,303
They are my family.

41
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,480
In Long Beach, it all comes down
to what you look like.

42
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,417
If you're Latino or Asian or black,

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:36,316
you could get blasted any time
you walk out your door.

44
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,181
We fight each other for territory.

45
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,776
We kill each other over race,
pride and respect.

46
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,115
We fight for what is ours.

47
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,795
They think they're winning
by jumping me now,

48
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,196
but soon they're all going down.

49
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,834
War has been declared.

50
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,329
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,637
I brought my lesson plans.
I'd love it if you'd look them over.

52
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,307
Yes, and these are the classes
you'll start with.

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,876
Freshman English, four classes,
about 150 students in all.

54
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,355
Some of them
are just out of juvenile hall.

55
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,295
One or two might be wearing ankle cuffs
to monitor their whereabouts.

56
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,367
And you see here,
we'll have to revise your lesson plans.

57
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,335
And if you look at their scores,
these vocabulary lists

58
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,340
and some of these, the books,
Homer's The Odyssey,

59
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,034
they're gonna be too difficult for them.

60
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,144
All right.

61
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,170
Also, for most of them to get here

62
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,545
it takes three buses,
almost 90 minutes each way.

63
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,639
My God.

64
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,480
So I wouldn't give them too much
of a homework load.

65
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,350
You'll just be wasting a lot of time
following up on overdue work.

66
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,252
All right. Thank you.

67
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,659
- You're from Newport Beach?
- Yes.

68
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,530
It's too bad you weren't here
even two years ago, you know.

69
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,935
We used to have one of the highest
scholastic records in the district,

70
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,598
but since voluntary integration
was suggested,

71
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,009
we've lost over 75%
of our strongest students.

72
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,571
Well, actually, I chose Wilson
because of the integration program.

73
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,778
I think what's happening here
is really exciting, don't you?

74
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,355
My father was involved
in the civil rights movement.

75
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,892
And I remember when I was watching
the LA riots on TV,

76
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,756
I was thinking of going
to law school at the time.

77
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,590
And I thought, "God, by the time

78
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,131
"you're defending a kid in a courtroom,
the battle's already lost."

79
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,861
I think the real fighting
should happen here in the classroom.

80
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,037
Well, that's a very

81
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,010
well-thought-out phrase.

82
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,639
Erin,

83
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,579
I think you're a lovely, intelligent woman.

84
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,681
But you're a first-time teacher.

85
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,984
As head of this department,
I have to be confident

86
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,560
you're capable of dealing
with what we have to face here.

87
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,855
I am.

88
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,694
I know I have a lot to learn as a teacher,
but I'm a really good student.

89
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,963
I am, and I really want to be here.

90
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:20,336
- Those are lovely pearls.
- Thank you. From my father.

91
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,509
I wouldn't wear them to class.

92
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,395
Honey?

93
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,761
What?

94
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,134
Do I look like a teacher?

95
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,516
Hey!

96
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,273
Hey, Chris, yo, what up?

97
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,630
Hey, yo, let's sit right here, man.

99
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:01,997
Hi.

100
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,973
Hey, girl, you wanna give me
some fries with that shake?

101
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,750
My name is Erin Gruwell.
Welcome to Freshman English.

102
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,248
I give this bitch a week.

103
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,379
Hi.

104
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,725
Okay. Brandy Ross?

105
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,557
Gloria Munez.

106
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,026
Alejandro Santiago.

107
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,000
Andre Bryant.

108
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,701
Eva Benitez.

109
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,472
Eva, not Eva.

110
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,109
Eva.

111
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,418
I have to go to the bathroom.

112
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,749
- Okay, make sure that you take a...
- Yeah, I know.

113
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,022
Ben Samuels?

114
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,127
That white boy hoping
he's in the wrong room.

115
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,492
I gotta get out of here.

116
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,658
- Sindy Ngor.
- Right here.

117
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,063
Is that correct?

118
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,266
- Jamal Hill?
- Man, what am I doing in here?

119
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,503
This whole ghetto-ass class
has got people in here

120
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,576
looking like a bad rerun of Cops
and shit.

121
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,541
You know what I'm saying? It's true.

122
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,206
- Are you Jamal?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,079
Well, for some reason
they have you registered in this class.

124
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,210
- Yeah, and that's some bullshit.
- It's the dumb class, coz.

125
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,446
It means you're too dumb.

126
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,692
- Man, say it to my face, coz.
- I just did.

127
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,489
See what I mean? Dumb.

128
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,927
- Man, I know you ain't talking to me!
- Okay...

129
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,589
Look, homey,
I'll beat that ass, homeboy.

130
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,757
Can you please sit back down?

131
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,834
Look, I got your spot on the team.

132
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,265
That's why you're over there
wagging your tongue.

133
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,631
Please sit back in your seats.

134
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,365
Look, your spot is good as gone. I don't
know why you keep wasting your time

135
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,305
coming to practice with them
two-year-old Nikes on your feet!

136
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,401
You don't know nothing about me, coz!

137
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,705
Broke down my whole situation.

138
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,872
Jamal?

139
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:23,949
So, now you're in my face now, right?

140
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,874
Sit your punk ass down!
Sit your punk ass down, homeboy!

141
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:26,974
I will run that ass off the field.

142
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,610
Shut your ass up. What's up, homey?

143
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,279
I mean, what's up?
Sit your ass down, homey!

144
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,356
Excuse me,
may I please get some help in here?

145
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,589
So do something! Back up!

146
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,685
You touching me now?

147
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,231
Sit down, homeboy. Back up,
I'm not gonna tell you again.

148
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,526
You gonna look at my face now, right?

149
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,929
You ain't taking nothing
from me, homeboy!

150
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,929
I will run your ass off the field!

151
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,163
Boy, sit your ass back down.

152
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,966
Don't even worry about it,
I'm gonna see you.

153
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,369
Tell him. Sit his ass down.

154
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,567
Sit your ass down.

155
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,644
Thank you. Let him out of here, man.
That's some bullshit.

156
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,376
Erin?

157
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,193
Erin, this is Brian Gelford.

158
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,092
He teaches Junior English
and the Distinguished Honors Classes.

159
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,995
- Hi. Erin Gruwell. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

160
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,867
- You saw a little action today, I hear.
- Yeah. It happened so fast.

161
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,895
Well, don't be discouraged.

162
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,203
You put your time in, in a few years,
you'll be able to teach juniors.

163
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,504
They're a pleasure.

164
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,273
By then, most of your kids
will be gone anyway.

165
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,113
- What do you mean?
- Well, eventually, they just stop coming.

166
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,084
Well, if I do my job,
they might be lining up at the door.

167
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,989
- Right?
- Yeah.

168
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,795
- Nice pearls.
- Thank you.

169
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,212
If it was up to me,
I wouldn't even be in school.

170
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,214
My probation officer threatened me,

171
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,841
telling me it was either school
or boot camp.

172
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,312
Dumbass.

173
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,320
He thinks that the problems
going on in Long Beach

174
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,549
aren't going to touch me at Wilson.

175
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,552
My PO doesn't understand
that schools are like the city,

176
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,721
and the city is just like a prison,

177
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:23,131
all of them divided into
separate sections, depending on tribes.

178
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,299
There's Little Cambodia.

179
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,738
The Ghetto.

180
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,634
Wonder Bread Land.

181
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:34,103
And us,
South of the Border or Little Tijuana.

182
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,246
That's just the way it is,
and everyone knows it.

183
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,442
But soon enough, you have little
wannabes trying to hit you up at school,

184
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,852
demanding respect they haven't earned.

185
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,688
It looks like this, one tribe drifting
quietly to another's territory

186
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,423
without respect,
as if to claim what isn't theirs.

187
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,668
An outsider looking in
would never see it, but we could feel it.

188
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,802
Something was coming.

189
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,751
Settle down.

190
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,727
Let's go over the first name
on the list, Homer.

191
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,725
Homer's The Odyssey.

192
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,527
I know Homer the Simpson.

193
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,497
No, this Homer was an ancient Greek,

194
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,903
but maybe he was bald
just like Homer Simpson.

195
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,372
Okay.

196
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,022
What's up?

197
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,358
Quietly, please.

198
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,567
Mrs. Gruwell,
he just took my damn bag!

199
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,004
Shut up!
Ain't nobody touched your damn bag.

200
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,097
Yeah, I saw you.

201
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,301
Jamal. Jamal. Get her backpack.

202
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,742
I didn't do nothing anyway!

203
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,006
- Jamal. Jamal.
- Okay.

204
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,932
Wait! Wait! Please, stay in your seats!
Wait! Stay in your seats! Please!

205
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,044
Slanty-eyed bitch!

206
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,118
Return to your classrooms.

207
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,021
Return to the classrooms immediately.

208
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,892
That's all you got?

209
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:15,037
Clear the school lawn
and the recreation field now!

210
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,972
...classrooms, or you will be subject
to disciplinary action.

211
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,479
You can best help yourself
and your fellow students

212
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:31,215
and your school by returning
to your classrooms now.

213
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,755
Please return to your classrooms.

214
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,620
Get up, bitch!

215
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:40,155
All students must return
to their classrooms immediately.

216
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,193
Erin?

217
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,863
Erin.

218
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,538
Hey, baby.

219
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,841
You okay?

220
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,080
Come here.

221
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,083
Are you sure about this?

222
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,483
Well, it's not exactly how I pictured it.

223
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,520
Don't tell my dad.

224
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,354
Hopefully, he hasn't seen the news.

225
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,493
- So, how's work?
- Dad.

226
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,265
- I was asking your husband.
- It's good. I mean, for now.

227
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,532
It's a good company.

228
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,607
I pretty much run
the computer data department.

229
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,008
- I thought you were an architect.
- He is. He's just taking a break.

230
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,807
And the money's good for now.

231
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,518
How much are you making,
$27,000 before taxes?

232
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,213
If you know, why are you asking?

233
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,150
So, what's everybody gonna eat?

234
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,281
With your brains,
you could run a major corporation.

235
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,087
Instead, I worry all night
because you're a teacher at Attica.

236
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,162
Can you hear what you're saying?

237
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,824
How many times have I listened to you
about walking civil rights marches?

238
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,731
These gangs are criminals,
not activists. You read the papers?

239
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,700
They said the same thing
about the Black Panthers.

240
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,772
I'll lay odds your kids don't even know

241
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,932
who Rap Brown
or Eldridge Cleaver were.

242
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,737
You're gonna waste your talents
on people

243
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,312
who don't give a damn about education.

244
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,510
It breaks my heart.

245
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,010
I tell you the truth.

246
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,511
Well...

247
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,557
I'm sorry. I can't help that.

248
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,129
- You think this is good enough for her?
- Yeah, I do.

249
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,634
Look, Steve,

250
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,205
if Erin thinks she can teach these kids,
she can.

251
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,741
You telling her she can't
is just gonna make her mad.

252
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,711
So he doesn't like your job. So what?
Why do you let it get to you?

253
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,922
I don't know, it just does.
I'm not used to disappointing him. I...

254
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,150
Just let me know
when I can brush my teeth.

255
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,316
- I hate that we don't have our own sinks.
- Come in. There's room.

256
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,654
All right. Thank you.

257
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,888
I can't believe he brought up my salary.

258
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,762
What's happened to him?

259
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,130
He was like Atticus Finch to me
when I was growing up,

260
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,863
and now he's talking about salaries?
I think he's playing too much golf.

261
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,506
In fact, I think he needs an intervention.

262
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,009
Why isn't being a teacher
good enough for him?

263
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,839
Honey, just calm down.

264
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,210
You know, except for marrying me,

265
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,875
you never seriously disappoint him.
He worships you.

266
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,316
He likes you. He just doesn't...

267
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,614
He just doesn't think
I'm good enough for you, which is fine.

268
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,589
That's what fathers do.
I'm sure I'll be that way someday.

269
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:24,151
Look, just, you know, stop worrying
about being his perfect daughter.

270
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,823
You don't live in his house,
you live in ours.

271
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,559
Or until we find one.

272
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,729
- Or until you build us one.
- Yeah.

273
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,197
With extra sinks.

274
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,481
You're a teacher
because you say you are.

275
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,894
I have this idea.

276
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,901
We're gonna be covering poetry.
Who here likes Tupac Shakur?

277
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:07,994
It's 2Pac.

278
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,371
2Pac Shakur. Excuse me.
Raise your hand.

279
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,574
Really? I thought there'd be more fans.

280
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,314
I have the lyrics to this song printed out.

281
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,147
I want you to listen to this phrase
I have up on the board.

282
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,847
It's an example of an internal rhyme.

283
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:28,450
What he does is
very sophisticated and cool, actually.

284
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,495
"Man-child in the promised land
couldn't afford many heroes

285
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,963
"Moms was the only one there
Pops was a no-show

286
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,365
"And, no, I guess you didn't know
that I would grow to be so strong

287
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,936
"You looking kinda pale, was it the ale?
Oh, pops was wrong

288
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,404
"Where was the money that you said
you would send me?

289
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,805
"Talked on the phone
and you sounded so friendly"

290
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,879
- Think we don't know 2Pac?
- White girl gonna teach us about rap.

291
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,005
No, it's not that.
See, what I was trying to do...

292
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,982
You have no idea
what you're doing up there, do you?

293
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,978
You ever been a teacher before?

294
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,451
And teacher gets nailed, y'all!

295
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,958
All right, Jamal, enough.
Jamal! That's enough!

296
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,759
You know what? I want you to move
to this front seat right here now.

297
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,162
- What?
- Come on.

298
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,235
I am sick of these antics
in my classroom.

299
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,240
Well, there you are.

300
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,002
I was wondering when
you were gonna lose that damn smile.

301
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,407
Switch with Ben.

302
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,036
- Come on.
- I can't go back there alone.

303
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,138
- It'll be fine.
- No, it won't.

304
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,341
I'm not sitting near him.

305
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,678
I ain't going up there without my homey.

306
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,116
I'm not sitting back there alone!

307
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,517
- All right.
- Shut up.

308
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,713
All right, you know what?

309
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,290
I want you all to move
to this side of the room.

310
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,520
You in the back, up here.
Sindy and all of you, move to the back.

311
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,790
Come on. Let's go. Now!

312
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,998
Get your ass back to China, all of y'all.

313
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:51,039
- You're all little midget-ass punks.
- Move before I stomp your peanuts.

314
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,109
Boo!

315
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,819
Get your ass to the back, boy.

316
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,208
Get off my desk.

317
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,916
So, everybody happy
with the new borders?

318
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,160
Eva?

319
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,959
Where are you going?

320
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,432
Hey! Hey!

321
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,462
This is bull! Come on, man! What the...

322
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,776
What the hell? Damn!

323
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,170
I want my money back!

324
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:21,143
This shit took my damn money!
I want my damn money back!

325
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,748
Look what you putting me through. Shit!

326
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,652
Learn to speak the damn language!
You're from this country, aren't you?

327
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,555
I want my money back!

328
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:29,394
I want my money back!

329
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,884
I want my money back!

330
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,119
Come on! Let's go!

331
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,518
Come on, come on, girl! Let's go!

332
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,375
Paco was scared.

333
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,107
In the car, he said,

334
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,187
"You can't go against your own people,
your own blood."

335
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,825
The same words
my father used so many times.

336
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,452
Only I saw Paco.

337
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,352
The others were turned away.

338
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,660
So when the police questioned me,
I knew I had to protect him.

339
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:49,073
All right, everyone, we need to get
started so classes won't be too delayed.

340
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,108
Principal Banning
would like to say something

341
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,177
in the light of last night's events.

342
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,074
I've spoken to the police.

343
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,808
As you might already know,
there were persons involved

344
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,317
in last night's shooting
who are Wilson students.

345
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,388
Grant Rice has been arrested
as a prime suspect.

346
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,856
Ms. Gruwell,

347
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,689
apparently one of your students,
Eva Benitez...

348
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,889
- Eva.
...has identified him as the shooter.

349
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,399
She's the prime witness in the case.

350
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,664
It is our policy not to discuss
the subject inside the classroom.

351
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,773
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

352
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,286
Hey, Tiny, check this out.

353
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,168
Hey. Hey!

354
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,245
Yes?

355
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,521
All right.

356
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,250
Gloria?

357
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,487
Please read the first sentence
on the board.

358
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,584
Why me?

359
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,562
Because I know
how much you love to read.

360
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,394
Close the magazine.

361
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,066
"Odysseus had no sense of direction."

362
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,174
Now, none of these sentences
are correct.

363
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,766
I'd like you to rewrite these sentences
using the proper tenses

364
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,380
and spelling on page four
of your workbooks.

365
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,457
I don't have a page four. It got torn out.

366
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,949
Okay, why don't you just use
the next blank page?

367
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,726
What's going on?

368
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,900
What is that? Give it to me.

369
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,223
- What is this?
- Just leave it alone.

370
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,432
You think this is funny?

371
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,426
Tito?

372
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,098
Would this be funny
if it were a picture of you?

373
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,769
It ain't.

374
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,580
Close the workbooks.

375
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,586
Maybe we should talk about art.
Tito's got real talent, don't you think?

376
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,597
- Yeah, yeah.
- Go, Tito.

377
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,126
You know something?

378
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:08,000
I saw a picture just like this once
in a museum.

379
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,374
Only it wasn't a black man,
it was a Jewish man.

380
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,241
And instead of the big lips,
he had a really big nose,

381
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,938
like a rat's nose.

382
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,073
But he wasn't
just one particular Jewish man,

383
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,379
this was a drawing of all Jews.

384
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,016
And these drawings
were put in the newspapers

385
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,613
by the most famous gang in history.

386
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,551
That's us, dawg.

387
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,528
You think you know all about gangs?

388
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,492
You're amateurs.

389
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,129
This gang would put you all to shame.

390
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:44,537
And they started out poor and angry,
and everybody looked down on them.

391
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,577
Until one man decided
to give them some pride,

392
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,137
an identity and somebody to blame.

393
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,851
You take over neighborhoods?

394
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:59,153
That's nothing compared to them.
They took over countries.

395
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,656
And you wanna know how?

396
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,616
They just wiped out everybody else.

397
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

398
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,097
Yeah, they wiped out
everybody they didn't like,

399
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,327
and everybody they blamed
for their life being hard.

400
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,097
And one of the ways they did it
was by doing this.

401
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,730
See, they'd print pictures like this
in the newspapers.

402
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:21,835
Jewish people with big, long noses.
Blacks with big, fat lips.

403
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,580
They'd also publish scientific evidence

404
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:29,915
that proved Jews and blacks
were the lowest form of human species.

405
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,584
Jews and blacks
were more like animals.

406
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,021
And because they were just like animals

407
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,320
it didn't really matter
whether they lived or died.

408
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:40,659
In fact, life would be a whole lot better
if they were all dead.

409
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,531
That's how a holocaust happens.

410
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,134
And that's what you all think
of each other.

411
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,261
You don't know nothing, homegirl.

412
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,873
No, I don't, Marcus!
So why don't you explain it to me?

413
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,976
I ain't explaining shit to you!

414
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,636
Do you even know how we live?

415
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,273
We was here first, man.

416
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,511
Just shut that shit up, homeboy.

417
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,410
All right! All right! All right!

418
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,819
So what you're saying is,
if the Latinos weren't here,

419
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,950
or the Cambodians or the blacks
or the whites or whoever they are,

420
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,688
if they weren't here, everything
would be better for you, isn't that right?

421
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,263
Of course it'd be better!

422
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,292
Lt'd be better if you weren't here.

423
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,029
Right. Right.

424
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,805
It starts with a drawing like this,

425
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,569
and then some kid dies in a drive-by,
never even knowing what hit him.

426
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,578
You don't know nothing!

427
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,216
You don't know the pain we feel.

428
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,412
You don't know what we got to do.

429
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,646
You got no respect for how we living.

430
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,279
You got us in here,
teaching us this grammar shit,

431
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,516
and then we got to go out there again.

432
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,116
And what are you telling me
about that, huh?

433
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,924
What are you doing in here that makes
a goddamn difference to my life?

434
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,262
You don't feel respected.
Is that what you're saying, Eva?

435
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,004
Well, maybe you're not.
But to get respect, you have to give it.

436
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,696
That's bullshit.

437
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:57,841
What?

438
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,035
Why should I give my respect to you?

439
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,770
'Cause you're a teacher?

440
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,210
I don't know you.

441
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,715
How do I know
you're not a liar standing up there?

442
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,911
How do I know you're not
a bad person standing up there?

443
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,580
I'm not just gonna give you my respect
because you're called a teacher.

444
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,786
White people always wanting their
respect like they deserve it for free.

445
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,855
I'm a teacher.
It doesn't matter what color I am.

446
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,796
It's all about color.

447
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,899
It's about people deciding
what you deserve,

448
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,301
about people wanting
what they don't deserve,

449
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,738
about whites thinking
they run this world no matter what.

450
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,742
You see, I hate white people.

451
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,778
- You hate me?
- Yeah.

452
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,974
- You don't know me.
- I know what you can do.

453
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,883
I saw white cops shoot my friend
in the back for reaching into his pocket!

454
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,215
His pocket.

455
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,122
I saw white cops break into my house

456
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,854
and take my father for no reason
except because they feel like it!

457
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,055
Except because they can.

458
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,762
And they can because they're white.

459
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,737
So I hate white people on sight!

460
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,777
Ben, do you have anything to say?

461
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,643
Can I please get out of here?

462
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:13,717
Lady, stop acting like you're trying
to understand our situation

463
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,251
and just do your little babysitting
up there.

464
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,651
- That's all you think this is?
- It ain't nothing else.

465
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:18,915
When I look out in the world,

466
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,491
I don't see nobody that looks like me
with their pockets full,

467
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,083
unless they're rapping a lyric
or dribbling a ball.

468
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,526
So what else you got in here for me?

469
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,064
And what if you can't rap a lyric
or dribble a ball?

470
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,761
- It ain't this. I know that much.
- Damn right.

471
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,997
And you all think you're gonna make it
to graduation like this?

472
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,902
I made it to high school.
Ain't nobody stopped me.

473
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,977
Lady, I'm lucky if I make it to 18.
We in a war.

474
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,705
We're graduating every day we live,

475
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,111
because we ain't afraid to die
protecting our own.

476
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:48,549
At least when you die for your own,
you die with respect, you die a warrior.

477
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,677
That's right.

478
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,483
So when you're dead, you'll get respect?
Is that what you think?

479
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,648
- That's right.
- That's right.

480
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,282
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

481
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,430
You know what's gonna happen
when you die?

482
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,560
You're gonna rot in the ground.

483
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:08,003
And people are gonna go on living,
and they're gonna forget all about you.

484
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,341
And when you rot,

485
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:16,436
do you think it's gonna matter
whether you were an original gangster?

486
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,181
You're dead.

487
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,954
And nobody,
nobody is gonna wanna remember you,

488
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,186
because all you left behind
in this world is this.

489
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,006
You're raising your hand?

490
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,483
That thing that you said before,
the Holocause?

491
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,145
- Holocaust, yes.
- What is that?

492
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,690
Raise your hand if you know
what the Holocaust is.

493
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,239
Raise your hand

494
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,540
if anyone in this classroom
has ever been shot at.

495
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,110
What about this?
We were discussing the Holocaust.

496
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,682
No, they won't be able to read that.

497
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,286
We can try.
The books are just sitting here.

498
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,116
Look at their reading scores.

499
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,486
And if I give your kids these books,
I'll never see them again.

500
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,525
If I do, they'll be damaged.

501
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,385
What about these? Romeo and Juliet.
That's a great gang story.

502
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:50,126
No, not the books.
This is what we give them.

503
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,865
It is Romeo and Juliet,
but it's a condensed version.

504
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,029
But even these,
look how they treat them.

505
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:58,232
See how torn up they are?
They draw on them.

506
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,306
Ms. Campbell?

507
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,571
They know they get these

508
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,376
because no one thinks
they're smart enough for real books.

509
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,450
Well, I don't have the budget
to buy new books every semester

510
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,744
when these kids don't return them.

511
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,581
So, what do I do?
Buy their books myself?

512
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,815
Well, that's up to you,
but you'd be wasting your money.

513
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,057
Is there someone else
I can speak to about this?

514
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,154
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, but

515
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,222
I don't understand.

516
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,129
Does the Long Beach Board of Ed agree

517
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,827
that these books should just sit here
and not be used at all?

518
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,562
Let me explain.

519
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,403
It's called site-based instruction.

520
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,376
It means that I and the principal
each have the authority

521
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,345
to make these kinds of decisions
without having to go to the Board,

522
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:41,908
who have bigger problems to solve.
Do you understand how it works now?

523
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,021
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to overstep your authority.

524
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,283
I would never do that. I just...

525
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,521
I don't know how to make them
interested in reading with these.

526
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:55,190
You can't make someone
want an education.

527
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:59,527
The best you can do is try to get them
to obey, to learn discipline.

528
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,400
That would be a tremendous
accomplishment for them.

529
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,871
Since you know Margaret
better than I do,

530
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,539
if I could just get
some backup from you.

531
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:16,518
I really think that the stories like
The Diary of Anne Frank and...

532
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,349
That they'd be so great for them,

533
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,914
and she doesn't seem to understand
that they could relate to these stories

534
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,653
considering all that they face.

535
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,662
Oh, of course. It's a universal story.

536
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:31,724
I mean, Anne Frank, Rodney King,
they're almost interchangeable.

537
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,565
- Are you making fun of me?
- Yeah.

538
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,869
God, listen to what you're saying.

539
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,309
How dare you compare them
to Anne Frank?

540
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:43,939
They don't hide.

541
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,539
They drive around in the open
with automatic weapons.

542
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,108
I'm the one living in fear.
I can't walk out my door at night.

543
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,621
And you blame these kids?

544
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,817
This was an A-list school
before they came here.

545
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,826
And look what they turned it into.

546
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,129
I mean, does it make sense

547
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,192
that kids who want
an education should suffer

548
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,237
because their high school gets turned
into a reform school?

549
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,829
Because kids who don't want to be here,
and shouldn't be here,

550
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,236
are forced to be here

551
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,310
by the geniuses
running the school district?

552
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,775
Integration's a lie.

553
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,578
Yeah, we teachers, we can't say that
or we lose our jobs for being racist.

554
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:23,778
So, please, stop your cheerleading,
Erin. You're ridiculous.

555
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,448
You don't know the first thing
about these kids.

556
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,582
And you're not qualified
to make judgments about the teachers

557
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,785
who have to survive this place.

558
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,732
We're gonna play a game, all right?
It's a lot of fun. I promise.

559
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,807
Look, you can either sit in your seats
reading those workbooks,

560
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:19,898
or you can play a game.

561
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,636
Either way,
you're in here till the bell rings.

562
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,647
Okay. This is called the Line Game.

563
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,307
I'm gonna ask you a question.

564
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,615
If that question applies to you,
you step onto the line,

565
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,349
and then step back away
for the next question.

566
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,152
- Easy, right?
- Yeah, whatever.

567
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,924
The first question,

568
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,426
how many of you have
the new Snoop Dogg album?

569
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,564
Did you steal it?

570
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,841
Okay, back away.

571
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,137
Next question,

572
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,739
how many of you have seen
Boyz n the Hood?

573
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,393
Okay. Next question.

574
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:13,395
How many of you live in the projects?

575
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:23,162
How many of you know someone,
a friend or relative,

576
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,276
who was or is in juvenile hall or jail?

577
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,375
How many of you have been
in juvenile hall

578
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,747
or jail for any length of time?

579
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,152
Detention don't count.

580
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,719
Does a refugee camp count?

581
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,225
You decide.

582
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,006
How many of you know
where to get drugs right now?

583
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:10,151
How many of you
know someone in a gang?

584
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,158
How many of you are gang members?

585
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,061
- Nice try.
- Nice try.

586
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,234
Okay, that was a stupid question,
wasn't it?

587
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,306
Yeah.

588
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,408
You're not allowed
gang affiliations in school.

589
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,908
I apologize for asking. My badness.

590
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:42,448
Okay, now I'm gonna ask you
a more serious question.

591
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:48,155
Stand on the line if you've lost
a friend to gang violence.

592
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,619
Stay on the line if you've lost
more than one friend.

593
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,654
Three.

594
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,272
Four or more.

595
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,115
Okay, I'd like us to pay respect
to those people now.

596
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,748
Wherever you are,
just speak their name.

597
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:05,769
James.

598
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:11,541
Beatriz.

599
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,416
Thank you all very much.

600
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,384
Now, I have something for each of you.

601
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,356
Everyone has their own story,

602
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:37,992
and it's important for you
to tell your own story, even to yourself.

603
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,695
So, what we're going to do is

604
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,807
we're gonna write every day
in these journals.

605
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:48,703
You can write about whatever you want,
the past, the present, the future.

606
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:52,714
You can write it like a diary,
or you can write

607
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:58,220
songs, poems, any good thing,
bad thing, anything.

608
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,018
But you have to write every day.

609
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:04,683
Keep a pen nearby.
Whenever you feel the inspiration.

610
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,787
And they won't be graded.

611
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:10,560
How can I give an A or a B
for writing the truth, right?

612
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,431
And I will not read them
unless you give me permission.

613
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,301
I will need to see that you've made
an entry, but I'll just do this,

614
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,931
skim to see that you wrote that day.

615
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:24,343
Now, if you want me to read it, I have...
Excuse me. A cabinet over here.

616
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:28,111
It has a lock on it.
I will keep it open during class,

617
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,051
and you can leave your diary there
if you want me to read it.

618
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,784
I will lock this cabinet
at the end of every class.

619
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,118
Okay?

620
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:44,999
So, you can each come up,
one by one, and take your own journal.

621
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,307
Whenever you're ready.

622
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,437
Eva holds back,
but I know she wants to be involved.

623
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,005
She's so stubborn.

624
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,472
Who really surprised me was Brandy,
who never says a word,

625
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,306
but she was the first to step up
and take a journal. I...

626
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,243
Honey, here. Here, sit down.

627
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,871
- It's all right. No, it's all right.
- I'll move this.

628
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,212
I don't mind standing.
Food goes straight down.

629
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,253
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- I don't know.

630
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,822
- Want to help?
- Not really, I'm a terrible drawer.

631
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:43,791
- You're an architect.
- All right, I just don't want to.

632
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,753
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

633
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,491
No, it's nothing.

634
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:53,093
Well, it's just, you know,
I want to hear all this, I do.

635
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:54,662
It just...

636
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,534
I feel like
we haven't talked about anything,

637
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,700
other than your job, in like forever.

638
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,071
I'm sorry.

639
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,607
- Well, what's going on at work?
- Nothing.

640
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,274
I don't want to talk about that, either.

641
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,180
I just want to hang out.
I want to be home.

642
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,112
And I want to be with my schoolteacher.

643
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,893
I've always had this fantasy
about being kept late after school.

644
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,664
Well, I'm sorry I left
my dirty erasers at work.

645
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,170
Do all the other teachers
put in this much extra effort?

646
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,072
I don't know.
I'm kind of making it up as I go along.

647
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,838
And the other teachers don't really
talk to me. I mean, Brian and Margaret...

648
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,880
- Honey, I don't want to think.
- I'm sorry. Okay, don't think.

649
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,108
- I just wanna...
- I'm almost done, okay?

650
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,882
So, how much longer?

651
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,453
Not long. Promise.

652
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,656
Thank you so much for coming.
Susan's a terrific student. Thank you.

653
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,392
- Great to see you.
- Good night. Take care.

654
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,434
- Jim, thank you so much.
- Thanks, Brian.

655
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,661
I appreciate you guys coming
to Parents' Night.

656
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,236
Drive safe.

657
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,604
In every war, there is an enemy.

658
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,725
I watched my mother
being half beaten to death

659
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:59,290
and watched as blood and tears
streamed down her face.

660
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,299
I felt useless and scared
and furious at the same time.

661
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,267
I felt useless and scared
and furious at the same time.

662
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,964
Stay there, Brandy. Watch the kids!

663
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,469
- Get my money!
- Watch the kids!

664
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,671
I can still feel the sting of the belt
on my back and my legs.

665
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,007
One time, he couldn't pay the rent.

666
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,550
And that night he stopped us on
the street and pointed to the concrete.

667
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,777
He said, "Pick a spot."

668
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:38,227
Clive was my boy.
He had my back plenty of times.

669
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:42,065
We was like one fist, me and him,
one army.

670
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,670
- That's heavy.
- Yeah.

671
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,369
That's the real shit right here.
Nobody'll jump us now.

672
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,544
But we got to practice
'cause this, this got power.

673
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,379
You shoot it, it...

674
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,091
I sat there till the police came.

675
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:10,131
But when they come, all they see
is a dead body, a gun and a nigga.

676
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:14,570
They took me to juvenile hall.
First night was the scariest.

677
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,071
Inmates banging on the walls,

678
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:23,306
throwing up their gang signs, yelling out
who they were, where they're from.

679
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:27,740
I cried my first night.
Can't never let nobody know that.

680
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,177
I spent the next few years
in and out of cells.

681
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,086
Every day I'd worry,
"When will I be free?"

682
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,561
My brother taught me
what the life is for a young black man.

683
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:44,100
Do what you have to,
pimp, deal, whatever.

684
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,634
Learn what colors to learn,
gang boundaries.

685
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,931
You can stay on one corner,
you can't stay on another.

686
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,768
Learn to be quiet.
A wrong word can get you popped.

687
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,969
If you look in my eyes,
you'll see a loving girl.

688
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,945
If you look at my smile,
you'll see nothing wrong.

689
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,813
If you pull up my shirt,
you'll see the bruises.

690
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,112
What did I do to make him so mad?

691
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:08,056
At 16, I've seen more dead bodies
than a mortician.

692
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:12,422
Every time I step out my door,
I'm faced with the risk of being shot.

693
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:17,226
To the outside world, it's just another
dead body on the street corner.

694
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,769
They don't know that he was my friend.

695
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,201
During the war in Cambodia,

696
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,295
the camp stripped away
my father's dignity.

697
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,908
He sometimes tries
to hurt my mom and me.

698
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,203
I feel like I have to protect my family.

699
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:33,305
I was having trouble deciding what
candy I wanted, then I heard gunshots.

700
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,247
I looked down to see
that one of my friends

701
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,378
had blood coming out of
his back and his mouth.

702
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:42,285
The next day, I pulled up my shirt
and got strapped with a gun

703
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,656
I found in an alley by my house.

704
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:47,059
I don't even know how this war started.

705
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,190
It's just two sides
who tripped each other way back.

706
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,791
Who cares about the history behind it?

707
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,036
I am my father's daughter.

708
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:59,507
And when they call me to testify,
I will protect my own no matter what.

709
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:03,370
Nobody cares what I do.
Why should I bother coming to school?

710
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,476
My friends are soldiers, not of war,
but of the streets.

711
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,415
They fight for their lives.

712
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,953
I hate the cold feeling of a gun
against my skin.

713
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,352
It makes me shiver.

714
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:17,187
It's a crazy-ass life.
Once you're in, there's no getting out.

715
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,886
Every time I jump somebody in

716
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:22,192
and make someone a part of our gang,
it's another baptism.

717
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,733
They give us their life,
we give them a new one.

718
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,167
I've lost many friends
who have died in an undeclared war.

719
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,907
To the soldiers and me, it's all worth it.

720
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:36,105
Risk your life dodging bullets,
pulling triggers.

721
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:39,141
It's all worth it.

722
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:57,455
Rum and Coke.

723
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,829
Oh, man.

724
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,195
This is...

725
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,705
Mr. Gruwell? Your table is ready.
Follow me.

726
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,033
- Dad, I got them.
- Okay.

727
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,079
Dad, I don't know what to do with this.

728
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,615
I'm not a social worker.
I'm barely a teacher.

729
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:14,684
Thank you.

730
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,981
These kids, they're 14, 15 years old,

731
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,784
and if they make it through the day
alive, that's good enough.

732
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,858
And I'm supposed to teach them?

733
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,252
Listen to me.

734
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:31,357
You're not responsible
for their lives outside that classroom.

735
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,605
- Just do your job the best you can.
- How?

736
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,969
The administration
doesn't give me any resources,

737
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,905
no books, no support.

738
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,338
So, what should I do?

739
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,277
Fulfill your obligation
till the end of the school year,

740
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,752
but line up another position.

741
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,556
Success follows experience.

742
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,957
So, get some more experience.

743
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,926
But no matter what,
you gotta remember, it's just a job.

744
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:08,704
If you're not right for this one,
get another job.

745
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,032
You're gonna sell bras
at a department store?

746
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:14,370
Just part-time.

747
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,002
I'm having a little trouble
getting books and things for the kids.

748
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,240
So, a little extra money
will give me a little more freedom

749
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,577
to do what I want.

750
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,084
And this way you can play tennis
with Evan after work.

751
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,211
Okay, let me get my head around this.

752
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,553
You're going to get an extra job
to pay for your job.

753
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,392
It's just temporary. I promise.

754
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,985
Once the kids' grades go up,
I'll get a little more help from the school.

755
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:37,294
And I get an employee's discount.
Isn't that great?

756
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,528
- Want a new TV?
- Yeah.

757
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,975
Excuse me, if I wanted to order
any books in bulk,

758
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,248
could I get some sort of a discount?

759
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,485
- These books are brand new.
- I know.

760
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,560
Okay, guys, gals. Listen up.

761
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:12,059
The only problem with this book is

762
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,897
it's about a gang member
and there's violence in it,

763
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,198
so you may not be able to read it
as part of the curriculum.

764
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:20,139
So, I'm going to try my best
to get permission, all right?

765
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,740
It's been a little difficult
getting their attention.

766
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:28,579
Up until recently, the only thing they
hated more than each other was me.

767
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,117
Well, you united them and that's a step.

768
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,315
What can I do for you?

769
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:40,928
I want to do more with them, and I need
the support of someone in power.

770
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,863
You have to take this up with your
department head and your principal.

771
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,968
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

772
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,264
My principal only listens
to my department head,

773
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,373
and she's not very supportive.

774
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,202
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

775
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:55,106
No, I'd rather just deal directly
with someone in power.

776
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,338
Ms. Gruwell, there's a system in place

777
00:56:57,447 --> 00:57:00,280
based on years of running
an educational facility.

778
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,544
- You have to follow that system.
- No. I won't.

779
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,522
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

780
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,525
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

781
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,425
if the kids making it to high school
have a 5th grade reading level?

782
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,327
I enforced that program.

783
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,524
With all due respect,

784
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,999
all that program is doing
is warehousing these kids

785
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,534
until they're old enough to disappear.

786
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,264
Look, I appreciate your intentions,

787
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,965
but there's nothing I can do
on a class-by-class basis.

788
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,635
Dr. Cohn, why should they waste
their time showing up

789
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,441
when they know
we're wasting our time teaching them?

790
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:34,278
We tell them, "Go to school.
Get an education."

791
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:38,480
And then we say, "Well, they can't learn,
so let's not waste resources."

792
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,345
I'm thinking trips.

793
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,324
Most of them have never
been outside of Long Beach.

794
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:45,894
They haven't been given the opportunity

795
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,520
to expand their thinking
about what's out there for them.

796
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,030
And they're hungry for it. I know it.

797
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,260
And it's purely a reward system.

798
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,198
They won't get anything
they haven't earned

799
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,430
by doing their work
and upping their grades.

800
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:57,870
But if Ms. Campbell
won't give you books

801
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,032
because of budget restrictions,

802
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,301
she's not gonna approve school trips.

803
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,876
I'll raise the money.

804
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,606
I just need to know
I won't meet resistance.

805
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,107
See, I can't promise them anything
I can't deliver.

806
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,651
It only proves what they already believe.

807
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:15,422
All I'm saying is, Ms. Campbell
doesn't need to be bothered.

808
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,691
You're a concierge at the Marriott?

809
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,956
It's just weekends.

810
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,999
You play tennis with Evan on Saturdays.

811
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,033
And you can play golf
with my dad on Sundays.

812
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,159
You want me to play golf?

813
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:29,567
And the bonus is I get employee rates

814
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,936
on Marriott hotel rooms
all over the world.

815
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,030
I've heard a lot of hyphenates,

816
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,612
but a bra-selling-English-teacher-
hotel-concierge has gotta be a new one.

817
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,237
You told me your part-time job
was temporary.

818
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,715
It is. I just don't know for how long.

819
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,352
- What if I said no?
- No, what?

820
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,888
No, I don't want you working three jobs.

821
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,015
- But I can make it work, Scott.
- No, that's not the point.

822
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,525
You can do anything!
We know that already.

823
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,654
It's just that I... You...

824
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,094
You didn't even ask me.

825
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,602
- I'm just trying to do my job, Scott.
- By getting two more jobs?

826
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,099
I don't understand, Erin.

827
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,768
Scott, this is our time
to go after what we want,

828
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,176
when we're young,
before we have a family.

829
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,609
Maybe this is the perfect time
for you to go back to school,

830
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,843
get your architect's degree.

831
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,852
Wouldn't that be great?

832
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,391
What?

833
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,357
Nothing.

834
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,035
So, I'll call you with a list of venues.

835
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,230
I've scheduled a PTA board meeting
for next week.

836
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,361
So, it should be no problem.

837
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,599
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

838
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,368
- Lovely to see you, Paula.
- Good to see you, too.

839
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,239
- Hi.
- Hello.

840
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:45,773
Principal Banning received a call
from Dr. Cohn at the school board.

841
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,112
Apparently you're taking your students
on a trip?

842
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,675
Yes, but it's over the weekend,
so it won't affect any test schedules.

843
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,483
I know how busy you are,

844
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,026
and since I'm paying for it myself,
I didn't want to bother you.

845
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,125
I'll be right back.

846
01:00:20,235 --> 01:00:22,895
Oh, no. No, no, no. Erin?

847
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:26,303
- Get back in the car.
- Dad, he lives right here.

848
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:29,430
I'll get him.
Get back in the car and lock your door.

849
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:34,064
- What's his name?
- Andre Bryant.

850
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:35,143
Andre.

851
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:43,241
Since my pop split, my mom can't even
look at me, 'cause I look like my dad.

852
01:00:43,748 --> 01:00:45,544
And with my brother in jail,

853
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,617
she looks at me and thinks
that's where I'm going, too.

854
01:00:48,951 --> 01:00:50,577
She doesn't see me.

855
01:00:51,186 --> 01:00:53,211
She doesn't see me at all.

856
01:00:57,823 --> 01:00:59,313
I'm going out.

857
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,785
- What up?
- Hey.

858
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,795
Where you going? I need you.

859
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,198
No, man, I can't now.
I got something to do.

860
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:12,923
Tonight. I'll do it tonight.

861
01:01:13,067 --> 01:01:16,160
I gotta go do something,
and I can't carry that around with me.

862
01:01:16,568 --> 01:01:18,398
Forget it, man, I'll get somebody else.

863
01:01:18,503 --> 01:01:20,561
I can't be waiting all day on you.

864
01:01:21,204 --> 01:01:22,296
Hey.

865
01:01:23,772 --> 01:01:27,172
Sorry about your brother, man.
I hear he going away for life.

866
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,908
They won't get it.
The guy he was with confessed.

867
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:32,136
To who? Your brother?

868
01:01:32,845 --> 01:01:35,244
Hey. You Andre?

869
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,187
- What up?
- Hey.

870
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:56,457
- What?
- Put on your seat belt.

871
01:01:59,828 --> 01:02:01,625
You, too, young lady.

872
01:02:05,098 --> 01:02:07,657
You kids ever been
to Newport Beach before?

873
01:02:07,866 --> 01:02:11,494
What? We went there last year
on our way to Paris.

874
01:02:17,772 --> 01:02:19,239
Paris.

875
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:24,608
It's good.

876
01:02:24,943 --> 01:02:26,604
I brought you something.

877
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,340
It's a good book. I read it in school.

878
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:37,247
It's about a gang kid,
and I thought you might like to read it.

879
01:02:45,455 --> 01:02:48,287
He told me what I had to say
when I'm on the stand.

880
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:48,151
At the beginning of the tour, they give
you a card with a child's picture on it.

881
01:03:48,326 --> 01:03:51,488
You could find out who they were
and what camp they were sent to.

882
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:55,393
And at the end of the tour,
you could find out if they survived.

883
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:58,528
I got a little girl from Italy.

884
01:04:12,842 --> 01:04:14,969
Tito, your hat.

885
01:04:44,929 --> 01:04:48,557
Kristallnacht, they called it.
The Night of Broken Glass.

886
01:04:48,664 --> 01:04:50,995
Hundreds of synagogues
looted and burned.

887
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:53,861
More than 7,000
Jewish stores destroyed.

888
01:04:53,968 --> 01:04:56,060
Over 100 Jews killed.

889
01:05:08,844 --> 01:05:14,246
A small center for children in Isieux
in the French province of Ain.

890
01:05:14,947 --> 01:05:17,848
Among the children deported that day
to Birkenau

891
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:21,315
was 11-year-old Liliane Berenstein,

892
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:25,318
who, before leaving,
left behind a letter to God.

893
01:05:31,157 --> 01:05:35,785
My little boy died.
He got off the train and they killed him.

894
01:05:36,293 --> 01:05:38,453
I don't know why
it bothered me so much.

895
01:05:38,595 --> 01:05:40,721
I've seen death all my life.

896
01:05:40,996 --> 01:05:45,659
But this little boy was only five.

897
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:10,071
Ms. G had a beautiful dinner for us
at the hotel where she works.

898
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:14,737
She invited real Holocaust survivors
from the museum to meet us.

899
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:17,714
There was Elisabeth Mann.

900
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:22,355
I had my parents,
my sister, my two brothers.

901
01:06:22,655 --> 01:06:24,121
Gloria Ungar.

902
01:06:24,222 --> 01:06:26,815
If any of you have seen someone
with a number on their arm,

903
01:06:26,924 --> 01:06:28,914
these were the lucky people.

904
01:06:29,025 --> 01:06:31,458
The people who,
when we came to Auschwitz,

905
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,359
when they tattooed the people
they took us to do the slave work.

906
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:39,090
Not the others,
and that included many of my family.

907
01:06:39,198 --> 01:06:41,461
So, we ran away,
some of the young kids.

908
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:43,999
I was at that time
11-and-a-half years old.

909
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:45,124
Eddie llam.

910
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:47,235
And where to go, I didn't know,

911
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:51,065
but I remember one place
where I used to live.

912
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:53,537
So when I ran there,
there was not one Jew left.

913
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,836
I was in the worst camp.
I was in Auschwitz.

914
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:58,408
And Renee Firestone.

915
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:02,410
When I arrived, my parents were
immediately taken away from me.

916
01:07:02,846 --> 01:07:06,143
My little sister,
who was then 14 years old,

917
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,909
stayed with me for a little while.

918
01:07:09,383 --> 01:07:12,579
And then later on,
I was separated from her also.

919
01:07:12,684 --> 01:07:15,311
She lost her whole family at the camps.

920
01:07:16,154 --> 01:07:20,247
She came to this country with $4
in her pocket and a newborn baby.

921
01:07:21,324 --> 01:07:23,484
I'll never forget these people.

922
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:26,421
And then she was killed
because they didn't want...

923
01:07:26,527 --> 01:07:29,426
I can't believe Ms. G did all of this
for us.

924
01:07:36,966 --> 01:07:38,558
Hi, honey, it's me.

925
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:41,260
Look, we're still at the restaurant,
if you wanted to drop by.

926
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:42,995
We haven't even ordered dessert yet,

927
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:45,467
and the kids are having
such an incredible time.

928
01:07:45,572 --> 01:07:47,334
You have to see them.

929
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:50,498
If you get in soon, come by.
It's only 9:30 now.

930
01:07:51,908 --> 01:07:56,343
Okay, I'll see you later. Love you. Bye.

931
01:08:27,864 --> 01:08:29,796
How many times
I gotta tell your ass again?

932
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,025
Get your butt in here!

933
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,786
So, you had all summer
to read and consider this book.

934
01:09:10,923 --> 01:09:14,688
And you know,
I thought it would be most valuable

935
01:09:15,392 --> 01:09:20,794
to begin with Victoria
to give us the black perspective.

936
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:23,660
Victoria?

937
01:09:24,465 --> 01:09:26,455
Do I have a stamp
on my forehead that says,

938
01:09:26,566 --> 01:09:29,125
"The National Spokesperson
for the Plight of Black People"?

939
01:09:29,368 --> 01:09:32,529
How the hell should I know the black
perspective on The Color Purple?

940
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:36,104
That's it, if I don't change classes,
I'm gonna hurt this fool.

941
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,263
Teachers treat me like
I'm some kind of Rosetta stone

942
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:39,838
for African-Americans.

943
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:41,703
What? Black people learn how to read,

944
01:09:41,808 --> 01:09:44,503
and we all miraculously come
to the same conclusion?

945
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:48,204
At that point, I decided to check out
my friend Brandy's English class.

946
01:09:48,312 --> 01:09:49,779
- Good to see you, man.
- Hey, yeah.

947
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,938
- How was your summer?
- Great.

948
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:58,418
You're still white, I see.

949
01:09:59,052 --> 01:10:00,917
Okay, everybody. Ready?

950
01:10:01,086 --> 01:10:02,212
- Hey, Ms. G.
- Hi.

951
01:10:02,321 --> 01:10:03,651
- Hi, Ms. G.
- Hi.

952
01:10:13,093 --> 01:10:16,584
Okay, guys, gals, listen up!
This is what I want you to do.

953
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:20,923
I want each of you to step forward
and take one of these Borders bags,

954
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:23,932
which contain the four books
we're gonna read this semester.

955
01:10:24,034 --> 01:10:25,262
All right!

956
01:10:26,002 --> 01:10:28,299
They're very special books,

957
01:10:28,403 --> 01:10:32,861
and they each remind me,
in some way, of each of you.

958
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:40,039
But, before you take the books,

959
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:44,476
I want you to take one of these glasses
of sparkling cider,

960
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:48,378
and I want each of you to make a toast.

961
01:10:49,683 --> 01:10:53,174
We're each gonna make
a toast for change.

962
01:10:53,618 --> 01:10:58,179
And what that means is,
from this moment on

963
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:04,089
every voice that told you
"You can't" is silenced.

964
01:11:05,225 --> 01:11:10,490
Every reason that tells you things
will never change, disappears.

965
01:11:12,029 --> 01:11:15,165
And the person you were
before this moment,

966
01:11:15,165 --> 01:11:18,964
that person's turn is over.
Now it's your turn.

967
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,197
Okay?

968
01:11:22,303 --> 01:11:26,260
Okay, you ready to get
this party going on?

969
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:30,866
- What?
- Stop doing that, man.

970
01:11:30,974 --> 01:11:32,531
What's the dealio?

971
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:43,805
Man, I've had boyfriends since I was,
like, 11, you know.

972
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:47,279
- I believe you.
- Shut up.

973
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:50,811
Okay, well, I was always the person

974
01:11:50,953 --> 01:11:54,388
that was gonna get pregnant
before I turned 16 and drop out.

975
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:56,654
Like my mom.

976
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:02,058
Ain't gonna happen.

977
01:12:02,293 --> 01:12:04,489
Nobody ever listens to a teenager.

978
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:08,857
Everybody thinks you should be happy
just because you're young.

979
01:12:08,965 --> 01:12:11,990
They don't see the wars
that we fight every single day.

980
01:12:12,768 --> 01:12:14,598
And one day, my war will end.

981
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:16,830
And I will not die.

982
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:21,739
And I will not tolerate abuse
from anyone.

983
01:12:25,275 --> 01:12:26,605
I am strong.

984
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:29,939
My moms kicked me out
when I got jumped into the gang life.

985
01:12:31,112 --> 01:12:33,409
But I'd like her to see me graduate.

986
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:36,810
I'd like to be 18.

987
01:12:41,118 --> 01:12:44,644
Ms. G?
Can I read something from my diary?

988
01:12:44,754 --> 01:12:46,220
That'd be great.

989
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:51,850
Who is he?

990
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:54,083
Man, he's been with us
from freshman year, fool.

991
01:12:54,226 --> 01:12:57,126
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

992
01:12:58,695 --> 01:13:03,154
"This summer was the worst summer
in my short 14 years of life.

993
01:13:03,865 --> 01:13:06,060
"It all started with a phone call.

994
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,934
"My mother was crying and begging,

995
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:13,992
"asking for more time as if she were
gasping for her last breath of air.

996
01:13:15,005 --> 01:13:18,064
"She held me as tight
as she could and cried.

997
01:13:18,173 --> 01:13:23,609
"Her tears hit my shirt like bullets
and told me we were being evicted.

998
01:13:24,011 --> 01:13:27,968
"She kept apologizing to me.
I thought, 'I have no home.

999
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:31,878
"'I should have asked for something
less expensive at Christmas.'

1000
01:13:31,982 --> 01:13:35,848
"On the morning of the eviction,
a hard knock on the door woke me up.

1001
01:13:35,951 --> 01:13:38,578
"The sheriff was there to do his job.

1002
01:13:39,486 --> 01:13:43,012
"I looked up at the sky,
waiting for something to happen.

1003
01:13:44,856 --> 01:13:48,416
"My mother has no family to lean on,
no money coming in.

1004
01:13:48,993 --> 01:13:52,654
"Why bother coming to school
or getting good grades if I'm homeless?

1005
01:13:53,294 --> 01:13:57,161
"The bus stops in front of the school.
I feel like throwing up.

1006
01:13:57,265 --> 01:14:02,029
"I'm wearing clothes from last year,
some old shoes and no new haircut.

1007
01:14:02,767 --> 01:14:05,098
"I kept thinking I'd get laughed at.

1008
01:14:05,135 --> 01:14:07,602
"Instead, I'm greeted
by a couple of friends

1009
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:10,034
"who were in my English class last year.

1010
01:14:10,138 --> 01:14:13,038
"And it hits me, Mrs. Gruwell,

1011
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,403
"my crazy English teacher
from last year,

1012
01:14:15,508 --> 01:14:18,169
"is the only person
that made me think of hope.

1013
01:14:19,243 --> 01:14:22,701
"Talking with friends
about last year's English and our trips,

1014
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:24,838
"I began to feel better.

1015
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:30,405
"I receive my schedule and the first
teacher is Mrs. Gruwell in Room 203.

1016
01:14:30,751 --> 01:14:33,886
"I walk into the room and feel as though

1017
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,514
"all the problems in life
are not so important anymore.

1018
01:14:38,155 --> 01:14:39,622
"I am home."

1019
01:14:41,623 --> 01:14:43,090
Yes, you are.

1020
01:15:03,704 --> 01:15:05,534
But you're an honors student.

1021
01:15:05,606 --> 01:15:07,197
If you transfer to Ms. Gruwell's class,

1022
01:15:07,339 --> 01:15:09,364
think how that will reflect
on your records.

1023
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:12,704
It doesn't matter to me.
My grades will still be the same.

1024
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,873
Look, Ms. Campbell.

1025
01:15:14,978 --> 01:15:18,571
When I first transferred to the school,
I had a 4.0 average.

1026
01:15:18,913 --> 01:15:22,370
But when I applied for advanced
placement at English and Math,

1027
01:15:22,482 --> 01:15:25,416
I was told it would be better for me
to be in a class with my own kind.

1028
01:15:25,517 --> 01:15:28,451
Now, when I did get in, my teacher said,

1029
01:15:28,552 --> 01:15:32,180
"Victoria, it's not every day one finds
an African-American student

1030
01:15:32,288 --> 01:15:36,154
"in A.P. And honors courses."
As if I didn't notice.

1031
01:15:36,258 --> 01:15:38,656
And when I asked
another honors teacher

1032
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:41,419
why we don't read more
black literature, she said,

1033
01:15:41,694 --> 01:15:43,661
"We don't read black literature
because of all the sex,

1034
01:15:43,796 --> 01:15:45,956
"drugs, cussing and fornication!"

1035
01:15:48,097 --> 01:15:52,726
I thought a simple "It's inappropriate"
would have sufficed.

1036
01:15:56,936 --> 01:15:58,870
Erin can't do that!

1037
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:01,536
Distinguished Honor Students are mine.

1038
01:16:02,139 --> 01:16:04,629
She's not allowed to teach them.
She's only been here a year.

1039
01:16:04,674 --> 01:16:06,265
The student requested it.

1040
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,968
And Gruwell has got Cohn
in her back pocket.

1041
01:16:10,245 --> 01:16:15,180
What gets me is they're violent, they
break laws, they destroy school property

1042
01:16:15,414 --> 01:16:20,451
and in the end we make them special.
We reward them like...

1043
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:22,816
I just don't see what that teaches them.

1044
01:16:23,552 --> 01:16:25,952
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

1045
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,412
Did you eat? I'm ordering in.
Are you hungry?

1046
01:16:28,522 --> 01:16:30,386
What question do you want me
to answer first?

1047
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:33,389
Did I eat or am I hungry?
I ate. I'm not hungry.

1048
01:16:33,492 --> 01:16:36,755
Something really cool happened today.
I got an honors student.

1049
01:16:36,861 --> 01:16:38,760
- Congratulations.
- Isn't that great?

1050
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:40,795
She actually requested my class.

1051
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:42,864
Can you teach an honors student?

1052
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,254
What do you mean?

1053
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:47,162
Well, I mean, you're used
to teaching your kind of kids.

1054
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,767
Can you teach somebody who's smart?

1055
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:51,561
Of course I can.

1056
01:16:51,703 --> 01:16:53,567
Yeah, but it's not like you have, right?

1057
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:56,901
I mean, you don't really teach
what everybody else teaches.

1058
01:16:58,474 --> 01:17:00,168
My kids' grades are up to B's.

1059
01:17:00,341 --> 01:17:02,774
Yeah, but the point is,
that's according to you.

1060
01:17:02,876 --> 01:17:05,672
It's not like they're really learning
what normal kids have to learn.

1061
01:17:05,711 --> 01:17:07,575
Normal kids? Yes, they are.

1062
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,169
They're reading
The Diary of Anne Frank.

1063
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,645
They're learning vocabulary,
grammar, writing, poetry.

1064
01:17:11,749 --> 01:17:14,046
All right. Okay, I apologize. Sorry.

1065
01:17:14,983 --> 01:17:16,540
Congratulations.

1066
01:17:24,622 --> 01:17:25,680
What is wrong with you?

1067
01:17:25,823 --> 01:17:27,814
You know, at Deb's party,
I heard you telling people

1068
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:30,323
that I was an architect
and that my job was temporary.

1069
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:33,451
I want you to stop that, all right?
I like my job.

1070
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:34,653
Fine.

1071
01:17:35,629 --> 01:17:37,722
You're the one who said
you were gonna be an architect.

1072
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,854
Yeah, four years ago,
before we got married.

1073
01:17:39,965 --> 01:17:41,557
What, I'm gonna go back to school now

1074
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:43,566
for two years and intern for three?

1075
01:17:43,668 --> 01:17:45,157
I'll be over 40.

1076
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:47,293
All right. I thought you still wanted it.

1077
01:17:47,403 --> 01:17:51,429
It doesn't matter if I want it, Erin.
It doesn't mean it's going to happen.

1078
01:17:53,607 --> 01:17:54,869
Why not?

1079
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,072
"Writing in a diary is a really strange
experience for someone like me.

1080
01:18:08,215 --> 01:18:10,945
"I mean, not only because
I've never written anything before,

1081
01:18:11,084 --> 01:18:13,381
"but also because
it seems to me that later on,

1082
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:16,282
"neither I nor anyone else
will be interested

1083
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:18,218
"in the musings
of a 13-year-old schoolgirl."

1084
01:18:18,322 --> 01:18:20,255
"Terrible things are happening outside.

1085
01:18:20,357 --> 01:18:21,755
"At any time of day,

1086
01:18:21,857 --> 01:18:24,324
"poor helpless people
are being dragged out of their homes.

1087
01:18:24,425 --> 01:18:25,449
"Families are torn apart."

1088
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,322
"If only I can be myself, I'll be satisfied.

1089
01:18:28,428 --> 01:18:30,156
"I know that I'm a woman
with inner strength

1090
01:18:30,263 --> 01:18:32,025
"and a great deal of courage.

1091
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:35,757
"If God lets me live,
I'll achieve more than Mother ever did."

1092
01:18:35,865 --> 01:18:38,924
"Anti-Jewish decrees followed
in quick succession.

1093
01:18:39,435 --> 01:18:43,734
"Jews must wear a yellow star.
Jews must hand in bicycles.

1094
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:46,965
"Jews are banned from trams
and forbidden to drive."

1095
01:18:47,106 --> 01:18:49,005
"Jews are forbidden to visit theaters,

1096
01:18:49,107 --> 01:18:51,131
"cinemas and other places
of entertainment."

1097
01:18:51,242 --> 01:18:53,334
"Jews may not take part
in public sports.

1098
01:18:53,443 --> 01:18:56,173
"Swimming baths,
tennis courts, hockey fields

1099
01:18:56,278 --> 01:18:58,871
"and other sports grounds
are all prohibited."

1100
01:18:59,914 --> 01:19:04,247
"I can't tell you how oppressive it is
never to be able to go outdoors.

1101
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:09,747
"Also, I'm very afraid
that we will be discovered and be shot."

1102
01:19:11,187 --> 01:19:15,486
"No one can keep out of the conflict.
The entire world is at war.

1103
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,850
"And even though the Allies
are doing better,

1104
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:19,618
"the end is nowhere in sight."

1105
01:19:21,827 --> 01:19:22,794
Hi.

1106
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:26,224
When is Anne gonna smoke Hitler?

1107
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:29,889
- What?
- You know. Take him out?

1108
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:34,593
Eva, this is The Diary of Anne Frank,
not Die Hard.

1109
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:36,935
Keep reading.

1110
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:41,666
"We talked about
the most private things,

1111
01:19:41,772 --> 01:19:45,172
"but we haven't yet touched upon
the things closest to my heart.

1112
01:19:45,274 --> 01:19:47,798
"I still can't make heads
or tails of Peter.

1113
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:49,671
"Is he superficial?

1114
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:53,210
"Or is it shyness that holds him back,
even with me?"

1115
01:19:58,851 --> 01:20:02,444
- Are Anne and Peter gonna hook up?
- I'm not telling you.

1116
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,879
"It's utterly impossible for me
to build my life on a foundation

1117
01:20:06,922 --> 01:20:09,788
"of chaos, suffering and death.

1118
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:14,219
"I see the world being
slowly transformed into a wilderness.

1119
01:20:14,326 --> 01:20:18,125
"I feel the suffering of millions,
and yet when I look up at the sky

1120
01:20:18,496 --> 01:20:22,226
"I somehow feel that everything
will change for the better."

1121
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,466
- Eva, what's wrong?
- Why didn't you tell me she dies?

1122
01:20:30,736 --> 01:20:32,999
Why you didn't tell me she gets caught
in the end?

1123
01:20:33,405 --> 01:20:35,531
I hate you and I hate this book.

1124
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:36,606
Eva.

1125
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:40,937
If she dies, then what about me?
What are you saying about that?

1126
01:20:42,143 --> 01:20:44,770
- Anne Frank died, but she...
- I can't believe they got her!

1127
01:20:44,879 --> 01:20:47,506
That ain't supposed to happen
in the story! That ain't right!

1128
01:20:47,613 --> 01:20:49,342
- 'Cause it's true?
- I ain't talking to you!

1129
01:20:49,447 --> 01:20:52,143
You're talking around me.
That's the same thing.

1130
01:20:52,249 --> 01:20:54,080
See, to me, she ain't dead at all.

1131
01:20:54,184 --> 01:20:56,879
How many friends did you know
that are dead now that got killed?

1132
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,350
Too many to count.

1133
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:00,886
How many have you read a book about?

1134
01:21:01,155 --> 01:21:04,123
Have you seen them on TV
or even in the newspaper?

1135
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,816
That's why this story's dope.

1136
01:21:05,924 --> 01:21:07,686
She was our age, man.

1137
01:21:07,825 --> 01:21:11,316
Anne Frank understands our situation,
my situation.

1138
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:14,362
And that Miep Gies lady,
the one that helped hide them?

1139
01:21:14,463 --> 01:21:15,690
I like her.

1140
01:21:15,798 --> 01:21:18,230
I got all these other books
about her from the library.

1141
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:21,197
Wow. You used your library card?

1142
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:24,192
No.

1143
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:31,235
Okay, listen up.
Marcus has given me an idea.

1144
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:35,230
Instead of doing a book report on
The Diary of Anne Frank,

1145
01:21:35,376 --> 01:21:39,310
for our assignment I want you
to write a letter to Miep Gies,

1146
01:21:39,411 --> 01:21:41,674
the woman who helped shelter
the Franks.

1147
01:21:41,779 --> 01:21:45,236
She's still alive and she lives in Europe.

1148
01:21:45,347 --> 01:21:48,111
In the letter, I want you to tell her
how you feel about the book.

1149
01:21:48,216 --> 01:21:50,707
Tell her about your own experiences.
Tell her anything you like.

1150
01:21:50,818 --> 01:21:52,979
But I want the letters to be perfect,

1151
01:21:53,086 --> 01:21:55,519
so be prepared to do more
than one draft, okay?

1152
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:57,087
Is she gonna read the letters?

1153
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:59,588
Well, right now it's
a writing assignment. I'll read them.

1154
01:21:59,757 --> 01:22:01,315
We should get her to read them.

1155
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,517
- Yeah, you can do that, right, Ms. G?
- Well, I don't know.

1156
01:22:04,593 --> 01:22:05,958
Maybe we should get her
to come and speak.

1157
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,891
Yeah, and have a big dinner again.

1158
01:22:09,663 --> 01:22:11,493
Wait. Guys.

1159
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:18,293
Guys! Everyone! Listen! She's elderly!

1160
01:22:18,402 --> 01:22:20,869
I don't know how to contact her.
I don't even know if she travels.

1161
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:22,596
And it would be really expensive.

1162
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,399
We could raise the money.

1163
01:22:25,339 --> 01:22:26,396
Ms. G?

1164
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:30,464
When Miep Gies come,
can I, like, be the one to escort her in?

1165
01:22:50,321 --> 01:22:51,617
Five.

1166
01:23:05,029 --> 01:23:06,427
Hi, I'm trying to get the number

1167
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:09,020
for the Anne Frank Foundation
in Basel, Switzerland.

1168
01:24:23,777 --> 01:24:25,335
Come in, Margaret.

1169
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,737
Ms. G sent our letters all the way
to Amsterdam

1170
01:25:14,841 --> 01:25:16,637
to Miep Gies, herself.

1171
01:25:16,842 --> 01:25:19,036
When Ms. G made up her mind
about something,

1172
01:25:19,144 --> 01:25:21,634
there was no stopping her,
man, for real.

1173
01:25:28,951 --> 01:25:33,078
And after we raised the money to bring
her to Long Beach, there she was.

1174
01:25:35,487 --> 01:25:39,285
But, damn,
I didn't expect her to be so small.

1175
01:25:57,934 --> 01:26:01,460
The bounty on a Jew was about $2.

1176
01:26:02,337 --> 01:26:05,600
Someone desperate for money
told the Gestapo.

1177
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:09,506
On August 4th,
they stormed into my office,

1178
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:16,577
and a man pointed a gun at me
and said, "Not a sound.

1179
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,706
"Not one word."

1180
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:22,474
And then they went straight upstairs
to the attic.

1181
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:25,449
I felt so helpless.

1182
01:26:25,551 --> 01:26:28,110
I could hear Anne screaming,
objects being thrown around.

1183
01:26:28,253 --> 01:26:30,982
So, I ran back to my house.

1184
01:26:31,121 --> 01:26:33,850
I looked for an earring
or knick-knacks, you know,

1185
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:36,718
anything I could take back with me
to bribe them.

1186
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,155
So I took this back with me,
all these things,

1187
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:44,558
and the soldier there took out his gun

1188
01:26:45,197 --> 01:26:47,390
and put it against my head.

1189
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:56,561
You could be shot for hiding a Jew
or go to a camp.

1190
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:01,228
So, another soldier
recognized my accent.

1191
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:05,135
He was Austrian, and so was I,

1192
01:27:05,575 --> 01:27:08,338
but I had been adopted
by a Dutch family.

1193
01:27:08,443 --> 01:27:12,242
So, he told the soldier with the gun
to let me go.

1194
01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:18,674
There isn't a day
that I don't remember August 4th

1195
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:23,816
and I think about Anne Frank.

1196
01:27:26,388 --> 01:27:27,479
Yes?

1197
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,452
I've never had a hero before.

1198
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:39,828
But you are my hero.

1199
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:43,992
Oh, no. No, no, young man, no.

1200
01:27:44,099 --> 01:27:46,794
I am not a hero. No.

1201
01:27:46,901 --> 01:27:53,428
I did what I had to do,
because it was the right thing to do.

1202
01:27:53,838 --> 01:27:55,236
That is all.

1203
01:27:57,274 --> 01:28:00,106
You know, we are all ordinary people.

1204
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:07,645
But even an ordinary secretary
or a housewife or a teenager

1205
01:28:09,048 --> 01:28:14,951
can, within their own small ways,
turn on a small light

1206
01:28:17,453 --> 01:28:19,250
in a dark room.

1207
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:20,980
Ja?

1208
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:28,750
I have read your letters,

1209
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:33,625
and your teacher has been telling me
many things about your experiences.

1210
01:28:35,764 --> 01:28:38,561
You are the heroes.

1211
01:28:39,866 --> 01:28:43,494
You are heroes every day.

1212
01:28:50,373 --> 01:28:53,808
Your faces are engraved in my heart.

1213
01:29:13,487 --> 01:29:14,852
You hungry?

1214
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:22,053
You know what you're gonna say
in that courtroom?

1215
01:29:22,693 --> 01:29:24,659
I know what I have to say.

1216
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:27,453
Yeah.

1217
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:30,392
- You know how that is.
- I know.

1218
01:29:31,765 --> 01:29:34,392
And that man that put your father
in prison,

1219
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:37,160
he knew he was sending
an innocent man.

1220
01:29:37,535 --> 01:29:38,831
But, you know,

1221
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:42,361
he was just

1222
01:29:44,438 --> 01:29:46,167
protecting his own.

1223
01:29:52,378 --> 01:29:55,072
What the hell does everybody
want from me?

1224
01:30:21,862 --> 01:30:23,829
Hey, Mama. Mama.

1225
01:30:29,432 --> 01:30:31,832
What the hell are you doing here?

1226
01:30:38,139 --> 01:30:42,073
I want to come home.
I don't want to be in the streets no more.

1227
01:30:42,173 --> 01:30:43,470
I'm sorry.

1228
01:30:45,976 --> 01:30:49,103
I want to change. I can't do it alone.

1229
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:52,639
I need you, Mama.

1230
01:30:54,448 --> 01:30:55,914
I need you.

1231
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,334
And what time was that?

1232
01:31:36,206 --> 01:31:38,504
I told you, 9:00, 9:30.

1233
01:31:39,176 --> 01:31:40,641
And you had a clear view
of the defendant,

1234
01:31:40,743 --> 01:31:42,607
Grant Rice, in the store?

1235
01:31:43,812 --> 01:31:46,177
I told you he was playing
the video game.

1236
01:31:46,779 --> 01:31:49,246
Then what happened?
What did you see?

1237
01:31:49,681 --> 01:31:51,773
Well, he got all whacked
because he lost the game,

1238
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:55,510
and then he started shouting and all,
threatening everybody.

1239
01:31:55,618 --> 01:31:58,813
He threatened everyone?
He threatened you?

1240
01:31:59,922 --> 01:32:02,354
No. The guy who ran the store.

1241
01:32:02,489 --> 01:32:04,513
He wanted his money back
for the game.

1242
01:32:04,557 --> 01:32:06,581
And what did the store owner do?

1243
01:32:07,425 --> 01:32:10,723
He shouted back.
And they were fighting.

1244
01:32:10,994 --> 01:32:15,259
Then he, the defendant, knocked
something over and left the store.

1245
01:32:15,831 --> 01:32:18,321
And then what happened?
What did you see?

1246
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:24,128
I saw...

1247
01:32:36,309 --> 01:32:37,776
I saw...

1248
01:32:53,053 --> 01:32:54,520
Paco did it.

1249
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:00,418
Paco killed the guy.

1250
01:34:26,009 --> 01:34:28,500
My father won't talk to me anymore.

1251
01:34:30,878 --> 01:34:36,247
And I have to lay low for a little while
because there's word out to jump me.

1252
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:39,947
So I'm gonna be living with my aunt.

1253
01:34:41,419 --> 01:34:46,377
See, my aunt lives even further away,

1254
01:34:48,456 --> 01:34:52,754
so I was just wondering if I could, like,

1255
01:34:55,893 --> 01:34:57,562
stay here late with you

1256
01:34:57,562 --> 01:34:59,461
stay here late with you

1257
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:05,823
so I can get my homework done,
'cause it's late by the time I get home.

1258
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:11,270
You can stay as late as you want.

1259
01:35:12,637 --> 01:35:16,595
And I can even drive you to your aunt's,
if it gets too late.

1260
01:35:19,842 --> 01:35:21,672
Ms. G, let's not get nuts.

1261
01:35:57,432 --> 01:35:59,366
I think I got your color.

1262
01:36:46,028 --> 01:36:48,019
Just come by the concierge
on your way out,

1263
01:36:48,129 --> 01:36:50,893
I'll have the directions for you.
Yep, that's fine.

1264
01:36:57,936 --> 01:37:01,735
Stop! That's it! Now, now! Hey!

1265
01:37:03,472 --> 01:37:05,940
You get an extra three seconds. Go!

1266
01:37:12,111 --> 01:37:14,374
...enraged them and provoked them
into acts of violence.

1267
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:18,743
In 1961, an interracial civil rights group
traveled by bus through the South

1268
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,577
to challenge segregation.

1269
01:37:20,682 --> 01:37:23,548
Blacks sat in the front,
whites in the back.

1270
01:37:24,018 --> 01:37:27,544
They were attacked, firebombed,
but they kept going.

1271
01:37:28,154 --> 01:37:32,316
In Montgomery, Alabama, Jim Zwerg
offered to be the first off the bus,

1272
01:37:32,423 --> 01:37:34,788
knowing there was a mob
waiting for them.

1273
01:37:34,924 --> 01:37:37,892
He was almost beaten to death
so the others could get away.

1274
01:37:37,993 --> 01:37:41,483
That kind of courage
is unbelievable to me.

1275
01:37:41,628 --> 01:37:44,994
I was afraid of just being in this class,
and I was ashamed

1276
01:37:45,097 --> 01:37:48,862
because I've always been the dumb kid
in school, even with my friends.

1277
01:37:49,033 --> 01:37:50,398
But not anymore.

1278
01:37:50,567 --> 01:37:52,090
And I must have some kind of courage,

1279
01:37:52,202 --> 01:37:55,931
because I could have lied
to get out of here, but I stayed.

1280
01:37:57,004 --> 01:37:58,301
I stayed.

1281
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,035
Hi, I'm home!

1282
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:05,575
Sorry, it got late. I drove the kids home.
I didn't want them taking buses.

1283
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:08,475
You're never gonna believe
what happened.

1284
01:38:09,846 --> 01:38:11,506
I'm so tired.

1285
01:38:12,014 --> 01:38:14,879
It's so cute, though.
They never want to go home.

1286
01:38:15,549 --> 01:38:18,779
We have such a good time together.
I'm gonna take a shower.

1287
01:38:38,396 --> 01:38:41,489
If you have another glass,
you're gonna have a headache.

1288
01:38:42,265 --> 01:38:46,667
Your bags are packed and you think
the wine's gonna give me a headache?

1289
01:38:48,669 --> 01:38:50,432
Why are you doing this?

1290
01:38:50,537 --> 01:38:53,801
Because I don't
pay enough attention to you?

1291
01:38:53,906 --> 01:38:55,874
No. That's not it.

1292
01:38:58,241 --> 01:39:02,300
I just... I feel like I'm living a life
I just did not agree to.

1293
01:39:04,645 --> 01:39:06,272
Erin, it's just...

1294
01:39:07,513 --> 01:39:09,003
It's too hard.

1295
01:39:09,614 --> 01:39:11,775
Your life is too hard?

1296
01:39:12,284 --> 01:39:14,807
I think what you're doing is noble.

1297
01:39:15,419 --> 01:39:18,978
And it's good. And I'm proud of you.

1298
01:39:19,588 --> 01:39:20,884
I am.

1299
01:39:23,224 --> 01:39:26,521
I just want to live my life
and not feel bad about it.

1300
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:29,787
- I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
- You don't have to try.

1301
01:39:29,893 --> 01:39:32,690
I didn't plan on becoming responsible
for these kids.

1302
01:39:32,796 --> 01:39:34,819
- Well, who asked you to?
- No one asked me to!

1303
01:39:34,931 --> 01:39:35,920
They're not even your kids!

1304
01:39:36,031 --> 01:39:39,830
Why do I have to be asked? Scott...

1305
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:48,870
I finally realized what I'm
supposed to be doing and I love it.

1306
01:39:49,005 --> 01:39:53,667
When I'm helping these kids
make sense of their lives,

1307
01:39:54,309 --> 01:39:57,141
everything about my life
makes sense to me.

1308
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,045
How often does a person get that?

1309
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:10,443
- Then what do you need me for?
- You're my husband.

1310
01:40:10,552 --> 01:40:15,453
Why can't you stand by me and be part
of it, the way wives support husbands?

1311
01:40:15,555 --> 01:40:17,419
Because I can't be your wife.

1312
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:27,024
I wish I could make that
sound less awful.

1313
01:40:29,197 --> 01:40:30,356
Erin?

1314
01:40:31,965 --> 01:40:34,524
You know,
if you had to choose between us

1315
01:40:36,034 --> 01:40:37,660
and the class,

1316
01:40:39,469 --> 01:40:40,902
who would you pick?

1317
01:40:42,937 --> 01:40:46,395
If you love me,
how could you ever ask me that?

1318
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:49,001
Erin, look at me.

1319
01:40:52,511 --> 01:40:54,672
This is all there's ever been to me.

1320
01:40:55,045 --> 01:40:59,413
This is it. I'm not one of those kids.
I don't have any more potential.

1321
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:02,773
See? You don't want to be here either,

1322
01:41:02,917 --> 01:41:06,249
'cause if you did, would you be
in the classroom every night?

1323
01:41:07,586 --> 01:41:12,214
That's not true. I want to be here.
I love you.

1324
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:15,357
You love the idea of me.

1325
01:41:20,894 --> 01:41:23,192
But it's such a great idea.

1326
01:41:26,864 --> 01:41:28,161
I know.

1327
01:41:56,216 --> 01:41:58,012
Dad? Hi.

1328
01:42:00,618 --> 01:42:03,814
You know, I was actually trying
to call someone else,

1329
01:42:03,954 --> 01:42:05,921
and I automatically dialed you. I'm sorry.

1330
01:42:05,955 --> 01:42:08,514
Look, I'm gonna call you tomorrow,
okay?

1331
01:42:08,657 --> 01:42:11,955
I need to make this call. I love you.

1332
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,490
Ms. G made us read Twelve Angry Men.

1333
01:42:27,602 --> 01:42:31,237
It's all about how this one juror
helped to turn the hearts of 11 jurors.

1334
01:42:31,237 --> 01:42:33,101
It made me feel hopeful.

1335
01:42:33,638 --> 01:42:36,902
At 2:00 today, my brother
was given a verdict on his own trial.

1336
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,667
No O.J. Dream Team,
just a court-appointed attorney

1337
01:42:39,809 --> 01:42:41,776
who probably thought
his ass was guilty.

1338
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:45,537
And I realized Twelve Angry Men
was just a book and nothing more.

1339
01:42:45,879 --> 01:42:48,608
My brother got 15 years to life.

1340
01:42:48,714 --> 01:42:51,443
Justice don't mean
the bad guy goes to jail.

1341
01:42:51,549 --> 01:42:53,744
It just means somebody
pays for the crime.

1342
01:42:59,588 --> 01:43:01,111
So, you got time now?

1343
01:43:07,992 --> 01:43:09,584
Anyone know where Andre's been?

1344
01:43:09,727 --> 01:43:10,989
I haven't seen him on the bus.

1345
01:43:11,128 --> 01:43:12,594
Yeah, I haven't talked to him either.

1346
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,023
Ms. G?

1347
01:43:23,402 --> 01:43:25,734
Are we gonna have
this same room next year, again?

1348
01:43:25,838 --> 01:43:28,964
I don't know.
You're gonna be juniors next year.

1349
01:43:30,507 --> 01:43:32,030
What do you mean?

1350
01:43:32,141 --> 01:43:34,836
Well, I teach freshman
and sophomore years.

1351
01:43:34,943 --> 01:43:38,070
You mean,
we're not gonna be with you next year?

1352
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:42,144
Well, I...

1353
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:47,745
I don't teach juniors.
I thought you guys understood that.

1354
01:43:48,251 --> 01:43:49,378
What? What are you talking about?

1355
01:43:51,586 --> 01:43:53,212
You don't wanna be our teacher
next year?

1356
01:43:53,321 --> 01:43:55,845
Of course I do. I can't.

1357
01:43:55,956 --> 01:43:58,446
- Why not?
- It's the Board of Ed.

1358
01:43:58,558 --> 01:44:00,491
It's regulations.

1359
01:44:03,227 --> 01:44:06,024
Ms. G hasn't been here long enough
to have seniority.

1360
01:44:06,062 --> 01:44:07,392
Who cares about seniority?

1361
01:44:07,529 --> 01:44:10,088
Shit! They can't do that!
They don't have the right!

1362
01:44:12,199 --> 01:44:14,996
- Ms. G, this is our kick-it spot.
- Yeah.

1363
01:44:15,134 --> 01:44:18,569
Everybody's cool with everybody.
Everybody knows everybody.

1364
01:44:18,702 --> 01:44:22,138
This is the only place
where we really get to be ourselves.

1365
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,297
There's no place like this
out there for us.

1366
01:44:24,573 --> 01:44:25,971
That's true.

1367
01:44:26,474 --> 01:44:29,034
I'm not allowed
to teach junior and seniors.

1368
01:44:29,176 --> 01:44:30,142
You're not allowed?

1369
01:44:32,177 --> 01:44:35,805
Ms. G, we can fight this, you know,
like the Freedom Riders.

1370
01:44:35,914 --> 01:44:37,676
Yeah, yeah,
we'll all drive around on a bus.

1371
01:44:37,781 --> 01:44:39,772
Only this time, they try and bust us up,

1372
01:44:39,882 --> 01:44:41,679
we bust a few of them
board members' heads.

1373
01:44:42,317 --> 01:44:43,306
Marcus.

1374
01:44:43,418 --> 01:44:47,045
Or we can go to the newspapers,
media. That'll get their attention.

1375
01:44:47,287 --> 01:44:48,754
Or we can paint
the administration building

1376
01:44:48,888 --> 01:44:51,355
with the word "assholes"
in various colors.

1377
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:54,784
Hey, it's something. We can do this.

1378
01:45:00,228 --> 01:45:01,195
What?

1379
01:45:01,296 --> 01:45:04,856
These are my books, not Scott's.
I'm packing the wrong books.

1380
01:45:04,964 --> 01:45:06,659
Honey, take a break.

1381
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:12,068
Sit down.

1382
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:17,831
I can't believe I'm getting divorced.

1383
01:45:19,307 --> 01:45:21,740
I never thought this would happen.

1384
01:45:25,710 --> 01:45:27,802
What do I do now?

1385
01:45:28,779 --> 01:45:31,247
Next year, I won't even have my kids.

1386
01:45:31,647 --> 01:45:33,944
You think you should stay with them?

1387
01:45:34,816 --> 01:45:37,113
Or is it better they move on?

1388
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:38,917
I don't know.

1389
01:45:42,721 --> 01:45:45,188
It's just a job, like you said.

1390
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:46,915
Yeah, it is.

1391
01:45:47,856 --> 01:45:49,824
But is the job finished?

1392
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,751
Listen to me now.

1393
01:45:54,027 --> 01:45:56,551
What you've done with those kids...

1394
01:45:58,964 --> 01:46:01,261
I don't even have words for it.

1395
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,958
But one thing's for sure,
you are an amazing teacher.

1396
01:46:09,837 --> 01:46:11,201
Special.

1397
01:46:11,972 --> 01:46:16,373
You have been blessed with a burden,
my daughter.

1398
01:46:18,343 --> 01:46:20,310
And I envy you that.

1399
01:46:23,012 --> 01:46:24,638
And I admire you.

1400
01:46:27,148 --> 01:46:31,139
And how many fathers ever get
to say that to their daughters

1401
01:46:31,283 --> 01:46:33,251
and really mean it?

1402
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:40,213
What she is suggesting
is in violation of our union charter.

1403
01:46:40,322 --> 01:46:43,483
She may not move on with her students
to teach them junior year.

1404
01:46:43,591 --> 01:46:45,580
She's only been here two years.

1405
01:46:45,692 --> 01:46:47,784
There are teachers here
who have tenure,

1406
01:46:47,893 --> 01:46:50,156
who have worked and committed
themselves for far longer

1407
01:46:50,261 --> 01:46:52,160
to attain a position of seniority.

1408
01:46:52,262 --> 01:46:56,219
Not to mention their experience
in teaching students of a higher caliber.

1409
01:46:56,332 --> 01:46:59,129
The Distinguished Scholars Program
is under our jurisdiction.

1410
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:02,063
I don't want to replace
the Distinguished Scholars Program.

1411
01:47:02,202 --> 01:47:04,102
I just want to stay
with my kids next year.

1412
01:47:04,203 --> 01:47:06,398
She can't. I have the juniors.

1413
01:47:06,472 --> 01:47:08,496
The Board of Education
will not allow this.

1414
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,572
Teaching rotations will be disrupted,

1415
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:12,971
retirement schedules
will be reevaluated,

1416
01:47:13,075 --> 01:47:16,509
disrespecting teachers
who have earned their way far longer

1417
01:47:16,611 --> 01:47:18,771
and who focus on the classroom,

1418
01:47:18,879 --> 01:47:21,710
not on public relations
and newspaper articles.

1419
01:47:21,814 --> 01:47:23,804
I didn't ask for those articles
to be written.

1420
01:47:23,915 --> 01:47:25,404
She's in the middle of a divorce.

1421
01:47:25,516 --> 01:47:28,006
Note, they stay late in her class,
they're eating, they're playing games!

1422
01:47:28,118 --> 01:47:31,211
All right, let's all just take a breath here.
All right?

1423
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:34,746
Now I had hoped
that we could talk this out,

1424
01:47:34,888 --> 01:47:36,583
maybe come to some kind
of arrangement.

1425
01:47:36,722 --> 01:47:39,190
- There is no arrangement...
- Margaret.

1426
01:47:40,058 --> 01:47:41,525
Carl, look.

1427
01:47:42,127 --> 01:47:45,186
Putting aside all obvious resentments
for the moment,

1428
01:47:45,294 --> 01:47:46,693
even if an arrangement were made

1429
01:47:46,796 --> 01:47:50,924
and she could teach them as juniors,
there isn't an accredited course

1430
01:47:51,032 --> 01:47:53,397
in the curriculum for her to teach.

1431
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:57,696
Unless Brian trades one of his
junior classes for a sophomore.

1432
01:47:57,802 --> 01:47:58,860
No.

1433
01:48:00,637 --> 01:48:02,867
Then there's nothing I can do.

1434
01:48:06,408 --> 01:48:07,704
So that's it?

1435
01:48:08,842 --> 01:48:10,308
Believe it or not, Ms. Gruwell,

1436
01:48:10,411 --> 01:48:13,139
there are other capable teachers
in this school.

1437
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:15,268
If you've made the progress
you say you have,

1438
01:48:15,413 --> 01:48:17,073
your students should be ready
to move on.

1439
01:48:17,181 --> 01:48:19,842
They might even gain something
from more experienced teachers.

1440
01:48:19,948 --> 01:48:23,212
You can't teach them.
You don't even like them.

1441
01:48:23,317 --> 01:48:25,147
What does that have to do
with teaching?

1442
01:48:25,253 --> 01:48:27,846
I've been an educator for over 30 years.

1443
01:48:28,254 --> 01:48:29,949
I have students that still remain
in touch with me.

1444
01:48:30,055 --> 01:48:32,489
I know what it is to be loved
by a classroom!

1445
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:35,558
You have no idea
how many battles I've had

1446
01:48:35,659 --> 01:48:37,318
fighting to be a better teacher,

1447
01:48:37,427 --> 01:48:40,793
and now, what, suddenly I'm incapable
of educating your students?

1448
01:48:40,895 --> 01:48:43,556
You know, if they move on
to our classes and they fail,

1449
01:48:43,696 --> 01:48:45,755
it'll be because they weren't prepared!

1450
01:48:45,898 --> 01:48:48,594
Lt'll be because you failed, not them!

1451
01:49:07,178 --> 01:49:09,839
Andre? Wait a minute before you go in.

1452
01:49:23,087 --> 01:49:25,555
I heard about your brother's conviction.
I'm sorry.

1453
01:49:25,688 --> 01:49:27,883
Is that why you've missed class
so much?

1454
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:29,786
I had things to do.

1455
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:34,856
About this.

1456
01:49:35,327 --> 01:49:36,488
The evaluation assignment

1457
01:49:36,595 --> 01:49:38,062
was to grade yourself
on the work you're doing.

1458
01:49:38,162 --> 01:49:40,596
You gave yourself an F.
What's that about?

1459
01:49:40,997 --> 01:49:44,194
- It's what I feel I deserve. That's all.
- Oh, really?

1460
01:49:45,768 --> 01:49:47,462
You know what this is?

1461
01:49:47,769 --> 01:49:51,761
This is a "Fuck you" to me,
and everyone in this class!

1462
01:49:51,904 --> 01:49:55,168
I don't want excuses.
I know what you're up against.

1463
01:49:55,507 --> 01:49:57,736
We're all of us up against something.

1464
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:02,074
So you better make up your mind,
because until you have the balls

1465
01:50:02,178 --> 01:50:04,975
to look me straight in the eye
and tell me this is all you deserve,

1466
01:50:05,079 --> 01:50:06,637
I am not letting you fail,

1467
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,739
even if that means coming
to your house every night

1468
01:50:08,848 --> 01:50:10,543
until you finish the work.

1469
01:50:10,649 --> 01:50:12,445
I see who you are.

1470
01:50:12,984 --> 01:50:15,110
Do you understand me?

1471
01:50:16,119 --> 01:50:18,087
I can see you.

1472
01:50:19,955 --> 01:50:21,889
And you are not failing.

1473
01:50:25,325 --> 01:50:30,260
So, take a minute.
Pull yourself together and come inside.

1474
01:50:30,795 --> 01:50:32,820
I want a new evaluation.

1475
01:50:38,032 --> 01:50:40,829
An F. What, are you tripping?

1476
01:50:46,505 --> 01:50:49,962
I want you all to know that
Dr. Cohn and I tried very hard.

1477
01:50:52,741 --> 01:50:55,607
But it's been decided we can't continue
with each other junior year.

1478
01:50:55,743 --> 01:50:56,835
- What?
- What?

1479
01:50:58,478 --> 01:51:00,378
You... Wait.

1480
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:03,080
Wait. Guys. Everyone.

1481
01:51:04,481 --> 01:51:06,949
No! That don't fly, Ma!

1482
01:51:08,518 --> 01:51:12,180
Look, first of all,
I'm not anyone's mother in here, okay?

1483
01:51:12,286 --> 01:51:14,482
No, it doesn't mean mother.

1484
01:51:15,190 --> 01:51:17,521
It's a sign of respect for you.

1485
01:51:31,733 --> 01:51:33,132
Listen to me.

1486
01:51:33,368 --> 01:51:34,664
All of you.

1487
01:51:35,434 --> 01:51:40,062
Don't use me as another excuse
for why you can't make it.

1488
01:51:41,972 --> 01:51:45,269
You made it to your junior year.

1489
01:51:46,074 --> 01:51:48,871
Think about how you did that.

1490
01:51:50,243 --> 01:51:53,906
Everyone in this room
has a chance to graduate.

1491
01:51:54,947 --> 01:51:57,505
For some,
you'll be the first in your family.

1492
01:51:57,615 --> 01:52:00,377
The first with a choice to go to college.

1493
01:52:01,384 --> 01:52:04,181
Some may move faster than others.

1494
01:52:05,786 --> 01:52:08,084
But you'll each have the chance.

1495
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:12,123
And you did that. Not me.

1496
01:52:19,195 --> 01:52:22,857
Now, I have one

1497
01:52:24,898 --> 01:52:26,489
final project in mind.

1498
01:52:26,599 --> 01:52:28,794
- Ms. G.
- Yeah?

1499
01:52:30,635 --> 01:52:35,593
Ms. G wanted us to put our diaries
together in a book, just like Anne Frank.

1500
01:52:36,339 --> 01:52:38,363
She got this businessman, John Tu,

1501
01:52:38,507 --> 01:52:41,339
to donate 35 computers
so we could work.

1502
01:52:46,412 --> 01:52:49,812
She told us we have something
to say to people.

1503
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:50,080
We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.

1504
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,377
We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.

1505
01:52:52,481 --> 01:52:56,177
We were writers with our own voices,
our own stories.

1506
01:52:56,284 --> 01:52:58,341
And even if nobody else read it,

1507
01:52:58,452 --> 01:53:02,046
the book would be something
to leave behind that said we were here,

1508
01:53:02,654 --> 01:53:05,747
this is what happened, we mattered.

1509
01:53:06,224 --> 01:53:10,488
Even if it was just to each other.
And we won't forget.

1510
01:53:12,194 --> 01:53:14,559
Ms. G didn't promise
it would get published or anything,

1511
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:17,527
but we could get it out there ourselves.

1512
01:53:18,264 --> 01:53:20,493
She asked us to come up with a title,

1513
01:53:21,032 --> 01:53:22,999
something to call ourselves.

1514
01:53:40,777 --> 01:53:42,642
I just received a call
from Karin Polacheck

1515
01:53:42,778 --> 01:53:43,870
at the Board of Education.

1516
01:53:44,013 --> 01:53:46,003
There's to be a meeting
with Dr. Cohn about your classes.

1517
01:53:46,147 --> 01:53:49,582
- Do you know anything about this?
- No.

1518
01:53:57,388 --> 01:54:02,847
These students, this class,
they've become a family.

1519
01:54:03,758 --> 01:54:05,349
To who? To you?

1520
01:54:06,026 --> 01:54:07,652
To each other.

1521
01:54:08,461 --> 01:54:11,793
Room 203 is a kind of a home for them.

1522
01:54:12,330 --> 01:54:15,661
Their trust is all wrapped up
in us being together as a group.

1523
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,225
Once they're out of her class,

1524
01:54:17,366 --> 01:54:19,800
believe me they'll slip back
into their old habits.

1525
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:23,858
Their reading scores, their writing
has markedly improved, Ms. Campbell.

1526
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:27,494
On paper. But what has
she accomplished in reality?

1527
01:54:27,606 --> 01:54:29,232
What about new students
that come in next year?

1528
01:54:29,339 --> 01:54:31,330
Can she repeat
this process every year?

1529
01:54:31,442 --> 01:54:32,840
Her methods are impractical,

1530
01:54:32,942 --> 01:54:35,569
impossible to implement with regularity.

1531
01:54:35,678 --> 01:54:38,167
What if every teacher
performed in this way?

1532
01:54:38,779 --> 01:54:40,007
We have millions of children

1533
01:54:40,114 --> 01:54:41,842
to get through the education system
in this country,

1534
01:54:41,948 --> 01:54:43,778
and we need a means
of accomplishing that

1535
01:54:43,882 --> 01:54:46,782
which allows as many students
to benefit as possible,

1536
01:54:46,884 --> 01:54:48,817
not just special cases.

1537
01:54:50,319 --> 01:54:53,776
And you honestly think you can create
this family in every classroom,

1538
01:54:53,921 --> 01:54:56,889
for every grade,
for every student you teach?

1539
01:55:01,459 --> 01:55:02,926
I don't know.

1540
01:55:09,132 --> 01:55:10,462
Thank you.

1541
01:55:30,844 --> 01:55:33,743
Hey, there go Ms. G.
Hey, there go Ms. G!

1542
01:55:42,651 --> 01:55:44,050
What happened?

1543
01:55:44,852 --> 01:55:48,651
So? Are we gonna be together
for junior year?

1544
01:55:54,491 --> 01:55:55,788
No.

1545
01:55:56,727 --> 01:55:58,591
- What?
- What?

1546
01:56:03,197 --> 01:56:06,562
We're gonna be together junior
and senior year.

1547
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,058
Yes!

1548
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:05,000
