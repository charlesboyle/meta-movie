1232
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:18,039
Where to?

1233
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:22,752
Just drive, baby.

1234
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,425
PORTER:
We were going for breakfast...

1235
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,970
...in Canada.

1236
01:37:33,055 --> 01:37:34,889
We made a deal:

1237
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:37,225
If she'd stop hooking...

1238
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:39,853
...I'd stop shooting people.

1239
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:44,232
Maybe we were aiming high.
