00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,492
(Choir singing in Russian)

2
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,754
(Applause)

3
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:02,656
- What did these slave-driving,
bourgeois scum bags

4
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,094
say to our request,
eh, comrades?

5
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,200
Our right to unionize?

6
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,201
They laughed in our faces.

7
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,737
They laughed in the faces
of the common man,

8
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,102
just as they have for centuries.

9
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:20,576
Now, we need these jobs
to be fair and well paid!

10
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,012
We need these jobs
to stay in our country!

11
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,085
We need a union
and we need it now!

12
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,982
(Cheering and loud applause)

13
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,282
(Cheering stops )

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,886
(One person clapping)

15
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,154
- Five, six, sev-

16
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,361
Five, six, seven, eight.

17
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,969
One, two, three, four, five!

18
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,038
We deserve to unionize!
Whoo!

19
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,040
- (Man): No idea...
(Cheerleaders cheering)

20
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,768
(Police car siren)

21
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,936
- (Man): Why you stopping?
Come on!

22
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,581
- That's it?

23
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,613
- We had 6 hours' notice, Leon.

24
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,947
- I know, I know.
- Sarah! Leon! Lunch!

25
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,454
- We're not breaking
the strike line, Ma!

26
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,388
- Who's breaking anything?
Maybe you don't wanna nosh?

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,653
- It's a hunger strike, Ma!
Jesus!

28
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,421
- I heard that.
Don't swear.

29
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,997
- Leon.

30
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,428
- Yeah, it's good!
- Achmed!

31
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,000
Dude!

32
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,500
- Sorry, Leon.
I'm starving.

33
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,433
- You're killing me here.

34
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,130
What are you-
What are you eating?

35
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,172
You're supposed to be
my right-hand man.

36
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,469
- I know, bro.
I- I'm sorry.

37
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,509
- Last chance for tuna salad!

38
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,306
Lots of mayo like someone likes!

39
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,108
- Please, stop it, Ma!

40
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,621
- Well, he's eating!
- I know, but he's not supposed to.

41
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,346
- Leon! What-

42
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,684
- Oh, shit!

43
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,587
- Sorry, sir, you can't go through.

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,285
- No, that's my son.
He wants to close my factory.

45
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,954
- Leon! Leon!
What you doing?

46
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,657
- Negotiations with management
have closed.

47
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,063
- Closed!

48
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,635
When were they ever opened?

49
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,135
- Hi, Daddy!

50
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,298
- What are you- What is-
You're cheerleading?

51
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,568
For what?

52
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,939
For-for your brother
becoming psychotic?

53
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:04,015
Anna!
- I came straight from tennis, honey.

54
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,345
- What is that?
What do you have there?

55
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,850
What is that, food?

56
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,283
You brought food?

57
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,854
- They're still growing.

58
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,651
They have to eat.
- Very embarrassing.

59
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,792
- My own wife...

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,359
- Calme-toi, mon chéri.

61
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,291
- ... is bringing a picnic
for Stalin here

62
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,260
who wants to destroy
my business!

63
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,196
- I have nothing but contempt
for Stalin, as you well know.

64
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,528
- Uh...

65
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,595
You have kids?

66
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:26,864
Oui?
Eh bien, OK.

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,031
- Union!

68
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,177
Union! Union!

69
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,175
- Here's what we're gonna do.

70
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,576
- Hey!
(Girls cheering)

71
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,095
- I know you want to start down here
with the workers and all that stuff,

72
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,996
but in a week or so when you get
bored out of your mind, don't be proud.

73
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,194
You come upstairs to
the office and I'll show you

74
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,236
how the business really works,
all right?

75
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,464
- We'll see.

76
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,541
- This is where
your grandfather started.

77
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,439
Right here on the floor,
just like you.

78
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,170
In 3 years,
he bought the business.

79
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,975
Isn't that something?
Why don't you come upstairs?

80
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,377
It's nicer upstairs.
Come on!

81
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,542
- It's just-
It's a bit too soon

82
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,280
to align myself with, uh,
with management.

83
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,445
You do understand.

84
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,591
- Align yourself...

85
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,988
(Sighing)
... with management.

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,219
You know what?
I'm not gonna even try to...

87
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,488
Whatever you say, Leon.

88
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,564
You start here,
do whatever you want.

89
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,257
- Wait! David,
where is our union-

90
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,366
- Don't call me David.

91
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,059
You know it makes me
uncomfortable.

92
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,000
- Fine. Uh, Dad?
- Thank you.

93
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,037
- Where's our union representative?

94
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,903
- You know that
we have no union.

95
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,509
We've never had one.
- I'm sorry. What?

96
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,805
- Why do you pretend that-
- This is a travesty!

97
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,971
- Achmed!
Listen, this is my son Leon.

98
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,312
He is anxious to plumb the depths
of the packing department.

99
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,011
Why don't you show him
what to do, where to start?

100
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,655
If you have
any problems whatsoever,

101
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,654
you come upstairs
and you talk to me.

102
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,453
Uh, Achmed, you have any
problems with him whatsoever,

103
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,926
you come upstairs
and you talk to me, all right?

104
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,257
(Sighing)

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,828
Uh, good job.
You're wasting a little plastic,

106
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,402
but you'll get better at it.

107
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,902
- Fascist.

108
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,404
- What did you say?

109
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,041
- Uh, fascist.

110
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,012
He's a fascist.

111
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,950
(Whispering): What is he?

112
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,109
- Fascist.
- Thank you.

113
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,118
- Achmed, I heard that.

114
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,259
- Remember? My God, remember
when we had the unions?

115
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,918
- Uh, what is everybody
still doing here?

116
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,825
Shipping deadline is at 4:00!

117
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,592
I don't think we're gonna make it.
- We're still on lunch.

118
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:36,928
- Excuse me?

119
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,970
- Oh, we demand a full hour
for a lunch break.

120
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,198
It's only been 56 minutes.

121
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,178
- Uh...

122
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,773
Uh, Leon...

123
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,076
I wonder if I could trouble you.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

124
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,219
Do you mind just giving me

125
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,947
just a couple of minutes
of your time up in the office

126
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,455
to discuss something?
- You exploit your employees.

127
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,956
- How? By employing them?

128
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,151
- By running a business

129
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,796
without any standardized
labour laws in place,

130
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,398
you, David, are acting
as an agent of sabotage

131
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,899
against all working people
across the globe.

132
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,900
- Sabotage?
You wanna talk sabotage?

133
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,063
What do you call talking my guys
into missing a shipping deadline!

134
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,401
- Progress.

135
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,908
- You know what?
I am not responsible

136
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,911
for workers
in the world everywhere.

137
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,245
I am responsible for keeping
this company in profit!

138
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,016
- So this is how it happens.

139
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,714
- How what happens?

140
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,089
- How it ends between
you and me, landowner.

141
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,163
- What? Land-
Landowner?

142
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,731
I lease the land!

143
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,135
I don't know
what you're talking about!

144
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,219
(Woman chuckling)

145
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,560
- I'm not staying.
I'm just here to collect my books.

146
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,899
- Where you going?

147
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,234
- Why? So you can
let the police know,

148
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,105
and have them arrest me again?

149
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,871
- Why don't we have
a conversation?

150
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,208
- Expect a conversation
with my lawyer.

151
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,874
- Your what? Your lawyer?
Are we getting a divorce?

152
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,610
Who gets custody of the child?

153
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,152
Oh, wait!
You're the child.

154
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,149
- So how wasjail?

155
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,058
- Brutal, in a word.
But, uh, I'm out.

156
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,459
I can't go back right now.

157
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,930
Next year, though.
Jail. Fingers crossed.

158
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,467
- So what are we thinking long term?

159
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,934
- Oh, I don't know.

160
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,573
Cuba or maybe...
Caracas, Venezuela.

161
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,072
I think Hugo would take me in.

162
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,404
- Hugo would love you.
- This is what I'm saying.

163
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,568
- Keep your voices down.

164
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,543
You're gonna wake your father.
Aw!

165
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,148
- What are we thinking short term?

166
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,945
- I don't know. Crash at
a youth hostel or something.

167
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,916
- A youth hostel?
- Stay in a hotel.

168
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,079
- Mais voyons donc!
- Stay in a hotel.

169
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,191
- Well, I can't afford it.
Dad cut me off!

170
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,257
- Completely?
- Yes.

171
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,861
- What a Nazi.
- Don't call your father a Nazi.

172
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,224
- Well, he is a Nazi!
- Don't say that word!

173
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,491
- Whatever, Ma.
You're not even Jewish.

174
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,634
- Hey! Sarah!

175
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,863
You're Jewish enough for me.

176
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,971
- You're proud of yourself?
Teaching your sister to talk that way?

177
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,403
- I didn't say anything!
- You don't have to.

178
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,975
She doesn't talk that way
when you're not around.

179
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,009
- Makes perfect sense.
She's never said " Nazi. "

180
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,114
- I don't want to hear
that word in my house!

181
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,512
- Freedom of speech is
an inalienable right

182
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,209
that you, sir,
have neither the authority

183
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,048
nor the wherewithal
to do away with!

184
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,211
- Stop yelling!

185
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,187
- Is it gonna be every summer
he comes home,

186
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,758
he turns my daughter
against me?

187
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,019
- Oh, David!
- Dad.

188
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,095
- I don't have to turn anybody
against you!

189
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,162
- I see.

190
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,798
- They're free to see the face
of oppression!

191
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,696
- The oppression
that pays for school?

192
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,361
- I hate that boarding school.
- Suddenly, you hate the school.

193
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,008
- Suddenly?
I always hated that school.

194
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,637
- Words have consequences.

195
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,609
I hope you're prepared for that.

196
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,254
- Leon?
- I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

197
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,157
- Can you just wait a minute, please?

198
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,424
(Sighing)
He's so upset when you fight!

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,090
- Oh, don't defend him!

200
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,396
- Fine.
OK. I want you to take this.

201
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,834
- I-I told you!

202
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,530
- It's not Daddy's!
It's mine.

203
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,676
You're my only stepson that I love.

204
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,370
And it's gonna kill me if I think that
you're sleeping in a shelter

205
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,139
with homeless people
peeing on you.

206
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,113
- Homeless people peeing on me?

207
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,377
- Yeah.
- Jesus. Yeah, OK, Ma.

208
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,851
- OK.
Oh, t'es fin!T'es fin!

209
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,582
I want you to
do me another favour.

210
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,953
- Mm-hmm?

211
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,561
- I want you to come
on Friday for Shabbat.

212
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,322
- Oh! I...

213
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,762
I- I-I don't want
to eat with that man.

214
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,401
- For me.
Do it for me. Please?

215
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,595
(Sighing)
- I'll make all your favourites.

216
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,568
- Shepherd's pie?

217
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,073
(Giggles)

218
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,608
- Oui.
Merci, mon chou.

219
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,542
- I love you very much, mom.

220
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,047
Be careful.
- Bien sûr.

221
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,184
- OK?

222
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,606
(Snare drum)

223
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,083
(Baby cooing)

224
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,266
(Violin)

225
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,410
(Bus passing)

226
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,320
(Bottles clinking)

227
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,550
- Hmm.

228
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,093
- Thank you very much
for not pissing on me.

229
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,045
(People talking, indistinct)

230
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,859
- Excuse me, sir.
Are you Frank McGovern?

231
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,961
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

232
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,426
- I'm not here. I'm leaving.

233
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,859
I'll be back this afternoon.

234
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,966
- Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, we need to talk now.

235
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,898
Um, unfortunately, neither of us
has any choice in the matter.

236
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,298
It's fate.

237
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,734
I mean it's...

238
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,466
not just that the conditions
were deplorable,

239
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,439
which they were,
believe you me.

240
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,409
Certain people weren't being
given a full hour for lunch,

241
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,242
let alone any semblance
of a break.

242
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,384
I mean, are we in
the industrial revolution?

243
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,247
Have these people never heard
of the Reform Bill of 1832?

244
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,888
This is all to say

245
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,616
that each of these ills seem
to require the same cure: union.

246
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,521
- And so you staged
a hunger strike?

247
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,288
- Yes, I did.
A perfectly legal hunger strike.

248
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,897
After which
I was detained illegally

249
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,533
at the urging of my father.

250
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,635
- And now you wanna-
- Sue him.

251
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,067
- For?
- I don't know.

252
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,467
What are my options?

253
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,541
I'm thinking, uh, wrongful
imprisonment, false arrest?

254
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,234
I- I-I'm not sure.

255
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,436
You see, this is
why I need council.

256
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,980
- No, I don't know
how I can help you, kid.

257
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,515
I haven't practiced law
in 20 years.

258
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:06,878
- Yeah, that's right,

259
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,213
not since the concentrator
and pellet facility

260
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,912
closed down
in Sept-Îles in 1982.

261
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,318
- Right.

262
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,085
But I still don't think
you need a lawyer.

263
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,593
- Oh yes, I do.
And I need it to be you.

264
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,892
- It's Leon, right?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,500
- Well, Leon, you're half right.
You need counselling.

266
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,660
But you haven't got a case
against your father.

267
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,135
Sorry.

268
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,390
- This isn't over.
- Yeah, it is.

269
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,599
- What would your colleagues of
the Communist Party of Canada,

270
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,598
which you led from 1971 to 1982,

271
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,361
think of you turning me down?

272
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,970
- You're following me?

273
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,107
- Maybe.
- Go home.

274
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,605
- In your Ph. D. dissertation,

275
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,274
you stated that
the dialectic is only growing...

276
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,012
that the illusion
of the middle class will die

277
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,917
and that a new
leadership will rise

278
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,284
from the ashes of that dream.

279
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,050
- My writing isn't that flowery.

280
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,659
- I am that leadership!

281
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,197
What about your fellow
Vietnam War draft dodgers?

282
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,267
What about taking haven
in this country

283
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,166
and in turn becoming
the chief architect and guinea pig

284
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,899
for our extradition laws!
Don't you feel an obligation

285
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,975
to see our labour laws
progress further?

286
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,044
- I'm this far away
from calling the cops, Leon.

287
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,613
- I'm not freaked-out
about finishing my Ph. D.

288
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,751
Maybe I don't want to go back
to being a Federal prosecutor.

289
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,750
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

290
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,755
- Please take my case!
- You have no case to take, Leon.

291
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,018
(Groaning)
- How-

292
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,923
What the hell happened to you?

293
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,586
- Get up off the street!

294
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,856
- Ah! I see...

295
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,193
Have you, uh, turned into
one of those people?

296
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,836
- Sorry, Alexandra.
- You Menshevik!

297
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:05,971
- This is Leon.

298
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,696
- Wait, wait!
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

299
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,931
Both of you.

300
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,237
You.
Uh, what is your name?

301
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,709
- Alexandra.

302
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,348
- Is she making that up?

303
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,575
- Why would anyone do that?

304
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,515
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
How old are you?

305
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,779
- How old are you?

306
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,889
- Uh, 17 and three quarters.
Give or take.

307
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,959
How old are you?
- I'm a whole 27.

308
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,858
- Oh my god!
Oh my god!

309
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,431
Oh, my god! It's happening.

310
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,227
It's happening.
So it's happening.

311
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,892
- What's happening, Leon?

312
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,231
- Uh, I think
I'm gonna throw up.

313
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,567
- What are you talking about?

314
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,199
- OK, you see, ever since
I first heard about him,

315
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,039
when I was a little boy,

316
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,908
and then as I got older,

317
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,313
I swear to you more and more
things started making sense.

318
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,476
And now, this...
This whole...

319
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,281
- Uh...
- This is...

320
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,186
What I'm about to say to you,
I've never said aloud,

321
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,226
aside from when I'm pretending

322
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,126
that Gourevitch is interviewing
me for The Paris Review.

323
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,630
Uh...
So, uh...

324
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,865
I'm the reincarnation
of Leon Trotsky.

325
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,734
Uh, and you and I
are gonna get married.

326
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,138
(Chuckling)

327
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,403
Nice to meet you.

328
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,038
- Leon! Leon!

329
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,344
I think it might be better
if you just let her go.

330
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,009
- Really?

331
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,455
Huh. Fair enough.

332
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,184
I mean it's, uh,
it's inevitable anyways, so...

333
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,627
- Right.
- Yeah.

334
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,163
(Man speaking Russian on stereo)

335
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,140
- (Anna): Leon? Supper.

336
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,574
- One minute.

337
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,410
- Oh, come on. You can finish
your little revolution after you eat.

338
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,882
- Please stop reading
my journal!

339
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,248
- Well, I figured out
why you're gonna marry him.

340
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,151
- Did he tell you?
- (Laughing): No!

341
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,723
I looked it up.
Listen to this here.

342
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:10,919
"Long before Leon Trotsky
and Lenin stormed into Russia

343
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,326
"and created the first
communist state in 1917... "

344
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,830
- Hey, Tiger.

345
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,264
I'm not in your first year
World History survey class.

346
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,528
I know who Trotsky was.

347
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,966
- Fine, then I guess you know

348
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,699
that Trotsky's first wife
was named Alexandra, right?

349
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,206
- Big deal.

350
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,277
- And that she was 9 years
older than he,

351
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,041
and that they were introduced
by a man named Franz...

352
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,911
something Czech...

353
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:37,351
who hosted politically-themed
garden parties in Kiev, where Trotsky-

354
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,356
then of course still Leon Bronstein-

355
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,756
went to school.
- Come on...

356
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,453
- I'm reading it out of the biography.
You can borrow it.

357
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,825
- No, thanks.
- You should.

358
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,830
- It's kind of creepy.
- Yeah.

359
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,526
- Creepy, funny, harmless.

360
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,694
- For now,
until he starts stalking me.

361
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,931
And I get the vibe
that's right up his alley.

362
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,439
(Frank laughing)

363
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,236
What's so funny?

364
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,244
- It's just that apparently
Alexandra hated Leon

365
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,008
when she first met him.
(Both chuckling)

366
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,755
- Hmm. It's so nice
to have you back, Leon.

367
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,458
It's always so nice when the whole
family is here for Shabbat.

368
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,659
- Yeah, you're always such
a pleasure, Leon.

369
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,465
- I hate you, Eli.
- Go home, Eli. Just go.

370
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,937
- See, this is my dad's home too,

371
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,269
which means it's my home.

372
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,570
So I can't really go home,
but nice try.

373
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,973
- Eli.
- What?

374
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,239
- You're unbelievable.

375
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,110
- She started it.
I'm just- OK.

376
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,410
- (Anna): Sarah, can you stop?
For God's sake.

377
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,781
(Baby cooing)
- (Becca): Yeah.

378
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,558
(Baby cooing)

379
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,249
- Shh!

380
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,462
- How's the brisket?
- It's dry.

381
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,725
(Both laughing)

382
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,869
- It's pretty good for a shiksa, Mom.

383
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,469
- Eli!
- What?

384
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,572
- Dad, make him stop please!
- Sarah!

385
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,640
- I have a question for you.

386
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,743
Leon, you recognize this, don't you?

387
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,903
My Life, by Leon Trotsky.
- How-how did you-

388
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,175
Uh, have I been betrayed so soon?
- Leon!

389
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,115
- You are such a dipshit.
- Can you not act your age?

390
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,777
- I am.
- (Anna): For God's sake!

391
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,115
- Now, circa 1860 or so...

392
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,087
I just can't find

393
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,989
where your Leon went to
a boarding school in here.

394
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,925
- It wasn't at
a boarding school.

395
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,657
It was a public school with
a liberal arts emphasis.

396
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,324
- Oh, of course. I'm sorry.
- (Whispering): I'm sorry.

397
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,094
- Of course
it was a public school.

398
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,501
Let me get it straight.
It's a little confusing.

399
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,471
So this Leon's father, he didn't
have to pay for his son's-

400
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,043
What would you call it?
Ingratitude? Insensitivity?

401
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,305
- Delusion?
- How dare you?

402
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,039
- I am just asking a question.

403
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,342
- OK, wait.
Ask my lawyer!

404
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,609
- Just calm down, Leon.

405
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,309
- Your what?
- I'm calm!

406
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,216
- Will you stop?
- No, he's passionate!

407
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,880
You believe in something.
You have a hero...

408
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,185
- Please stop, David!
It's upsetting him!

409
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,658
- He's a great man.
Look how thick the book is.

410
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,729
But listen, you want
to be just like him?

411
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,492
I'm gonna make it
really easy for you.

412
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,530
This coming fall, you, Leon,

413
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,233
just like this Leon,
will be going to public school.

414
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,572
(Snorts )

415
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,548
(Baby cooing)

416
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,142
(Knocking)

417
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,185
- I didn't say anything to him,
I swear to-

418
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,954
Are you OK?

419
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,187
- Oh, yeah, yeah!
No, I'm, uh...

420
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,390
It's a good idea.
It's-it's gonna be good for me.

421
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,831
I...
I love public stuff.

422
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,198
This is public school.

423
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,506
With all the public people.

424
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,338
- Montreal, Toronto and
Vancouver. Just like you asked.

425
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,037
- Oh, great!

426
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,614
Thank you.

427
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,648
(Sighing)

428
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,620
- Why do you want these?

429
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,690
- Oh, uh, my destiny.
Card 4.

430
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,595
- Oh.

431
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,322
- OK.

432
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,232
( Malajube singing Ton Plat Favori)

433
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,369
Um, hello there.

434
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,067
Uh, this is my first day here.

435
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,442
I believe I'm meant to ask you
where my homeroom is.

436
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,946
- Name?

437
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,174
- Leon Bronstein.

438
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,046
- Leon Bronstein?

439
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,615
Principal Berkhoff,
this is Leon Bronstein.

440
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,624
- Leon Bronstein.
We've been waiting for you.

441
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,626
- Ah! Well, in that case,

442
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,924
I'll tell you that I don't have

443
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,000
a tremendous amount of
experience with public schools,

444
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,763
but I've decided
that I'm going to like it.

445
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,235
- Good!

446
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:25,934
I think you'll find this is
not like most public schools.

447
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,011
I like to run a pretty tight ship.

448
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,546
- I respond passionately
to structure, so...

449
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,149
- Then we should
get along just fine.

450
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,306
- Ah!

451
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,488
- Your homeroom and schedule
are in there.

452
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,559
And that's the activities board
if you care about that stuff.

453
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,106
(Knocking)

454
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,148
- Oh, shit.

455
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,547
(Girl giggling)

456
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,984
(Coughing)

457
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,352
- Oh god.
Oh my god! I'm sorry.

458
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,255
We thought
you were a teacher.

459
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,157
- Yeah, man.
Uh, close the door.

460
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,264
(Coughs clears throat)

461
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,630
- Ah!

462
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,998
Um, are you people the,
uh, union representatives

463
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,103
that I sign in with?

464
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,105
- The union representatives?

465
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,435
Uh, sure.

466
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,443
- Uh, do you want
to help with the dance?

467
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,009
- I want to join the union.

468
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,979
- Are you new?

469
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,120
- I get it.

470
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,982
You think this is like-

471
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,023
you think this is like a union,
like-like the Teamsters.

472
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,420
- Oh! No. No.
No, no, no.

473
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,560
That-that's not us.

474
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,662
- No, no. This is just
like student's council.

475
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,025
Like, uh... Ha!

476
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,188
I don't know.
A council?

477
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,356
(Both laughing)

478
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,264
It's not a union.
That's just the name.

479
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,497
- All right, well, uh, what sort
of legislative powers

480
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,573
do you guys have
as a council?

481
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,008
- Uh, none.

482
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,043
- Uh, the power
to organize a dance.

483
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,578
You want to help?

484
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,225
(Sniffing)

485
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,531
- (British accent): Skip.

486
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,569
How did you manage
to get mud on your shoes?

487
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,262
It hasn't rained for days.

488
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,806
- Oh, um, I don't know.
Sorry, Ms. Davis.

489
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,967
- Apologize to me
in detention this afternoon.

490
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,943
- Actually, I have to go to
the orthodontist this afternoon.

491
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,945
- Perhaps, you should have
thought of that

492
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:48,142
before you walked into
my school with muddy shoes.

493
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,344
Welcome back, Skip.

494
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,315
(Bell ringing)

495
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,516
- God! She's such a bitch!

496
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,752
I can't believe
she's already started on me.

497
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,190
- Is it actual school policy

498
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,093
that you can't have
muddy shoes in the hallways?

499
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,756
- Um.

500
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,834
- Yeah, I'll go to detention with you.

501
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,131
Solidarity.
- All right, everyone!

502
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,866
- OK.
- (Man): Class started 2 minutes ago.

503
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,839
- Oh, Jimmy!

504
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,273
- (Whispering): Fuck!

505
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,244
- Welcome back.
How was your summer?

506
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,509
Tuck in your shirt.
See you in detention.

507
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,175
Sheila!

508
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,482
Sheila, take that thing
out of your nose.

509
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,885
You are not a bull.

510
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,025
- Sorry, Ms. Davis.

511
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,888
- Apologize in detention.

512
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,858
And don't act like a hussy!

513
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,464
(Scoffs)
- What a cunt!

514
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,262
- Fascist.

515
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,271
- Since this is
the first day of detention,

516
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,909
I requested to be
the supervisor

517
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:49,137
so that you would all know
just how bad it can be.

518
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,078
All which to say,
you don't want to be here,

519
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,514
I don't want you to be here,

520
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,052
so shape up
and don't come back.

521
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,381
- Um, Ms. Davis?

522
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,048
Since it's the first day
of school

523
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,820
and we don't really
have any homework,

524
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:04,962
can we just read?

525
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,157
- No.

526
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,061
I brought math with me.

527
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,428
- Hi there!

528
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,002
Sorry I'm late. I had trouble
finding your place.

529
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,332
Hi, you guys.
How's it going? I know you.

530
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,898
- What is your name?

531
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,943
- Oh!
Uh, I don't have detention.

532
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,943
Uh, I'm just here in protest.

533
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,981
I took the liberty of reading up

534
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,952
on the school-board regulations
vis-à-vis, uh, detention.

535
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,282
And, uh, mud isn't in there.

536
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,857
Neither are, uh,
nose rings for that matter.

537
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,927
And between you and me,
it is the first day of school,

538
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,530
you probably could've
let the shirt thing slide.

539
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,894
How are you?
Are you well?

540
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,092
- Young man!

541
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,169
I don't know
who you think you are-

542
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,236
- Leon Bronstein.

543
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:50,135
I am the reincarnation
of Leon Trotsky.

544
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,970
And if you give Skip
or any other student

545
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,271
another unjustifiable
detention again,

546
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,939
you and I are going to have
a very serious problem, Mrs...

547
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,584
I'm sorry.
What was your name?

548
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,125
- So, we're celebrating tonight,
and by celebrating,

549
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,420
I mean you actually have to
leave your house.

550
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,155
- Oh, no, we're not.
We are doing nothing tonight.

551
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,300
- No! I told Lucy I'd get you drunk.
Don't make me a liar.

552
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,833
- Stop emailing my mother.

553
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,096
- I like your mother.
- You can have her.

554
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,262
(Laughing)
Oh shit!

555
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,908
- Oh my God!
Is that your future husband?

556
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,941
- Um...
- Hi, honey!

557
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,580
- Don't leave me.
This could get ugly.

558
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,840
Not funny. Not funny.

559
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,610
What are you doing here?
- Um...

560
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,310
Congratulations on
defending your thesis!

561
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,588
- I don't want to see you.

562
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,987
- Why not?

563
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,390
- Uh, you frighten me.
I think you're crazy.

564
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,086
(Chuckling)
- But I love you.

565
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,461
- Wow!
OK, uh, I think I'm gonna leave now.

566
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,124
- Uh, please don't.

567
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,964
- Call me later.
- I won't.

568
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,936
- And, um, it was very nice
to meet you.

569
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,233
- Thank you. I think so.

570
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,467
- OK.

571
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,508
- Oh! Say hi to Julian for me.

572
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,710
- Hi.

573
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,918
Uh, could...

574
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,213
(Sighing)

575
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,551
Could we please go, um,
and have coffee together?

576
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,056
Um...

577
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:19,390
Please don't say
anything mean to me anymore.

578
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,465
- Stop asking me to marry you, OK?

579
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,534
Seriously, it freaks me out.

580
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,330
- Really?

581
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,994
- Mm-hmm.

582
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,970
- Fine. Fine.

583
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,972
Fine.

584
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,374
(Siren)

585
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,014
- Was that a no?

586
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,479
No. Hey!

587
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,517
That was a joke!
That was sort of a joke!

588
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,888
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

589
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,492
So you really think

590
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,899
that you're the same person
as Leon Trotsky?

591
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,197
- Yes.

592
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,136
- And you think that
you're gonna live out his life

593
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,244
exactly as it happened to him,
ice pick and all?

594
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,141
- Correct.

595
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:14,277
- Well, my limited knowledge
of Trotsky involves,

596
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,215
um, a lot of travelling

597
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,584
and a lot of
assassination attempts.

598
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,056
- Have you been
reading up on him?

599
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,359
- What I mean is
that it's a lot to live up to.

600
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,888
- Uh...

601
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,127
I actually like to look at it
as a lot to look forward to.

602
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,463
(Chuckling)

603
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,732
- Well, for a Marxist,
you'd make a great Hindu.

604
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,976
- What? Oh...

605
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,011
Well, Terry Eagleton
encourages us

606
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,149
to let Marxism breathe
in our new century

607
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,183
by allowing for things
which Karl Marx, frankly,

608
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,285
had no opinion on,

609
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,978
by letting the guidelines

610
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,522
of the Great Dialectic,
or the Grand Narrative,

611
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,558
guide us towards moral
and not moralist thinking.

612
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,060
- Was that "gobbledeegook?"

613
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,959
- Hells no.

614
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,123
- I didn't think so.

615
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,334
- So his name is Julian?

616
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,904
- No, he's making it up.

617
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,768
- And, uh...

618
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,137
How heartbroken will Julian be

619
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,109
when you break up with him
for me?

620
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,980
(Sighing)

621
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,550
- So, I'm that-a-way

622
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,018
and the bus stop is that-a-way.

623
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,249
- Yeah. I know.

624
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,888
- Good night.

625
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,323
- Night.

626
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:36,258
- This is
the end of our date.

627
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,731
- Oh, I know.

628
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,432
I'm just staring at
how beautiful you are.

629
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,540
(Giggles nervously )

630
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,210
I thank you for a very
lovely evening.

631
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,349
- Uh...

632
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,038
- Sit down.

633
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,978
So, are you enjoying
public school

634
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,048
as much as you hoped
that you would?

635
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,617
- Uh, see, it's all very exciting.

636
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,550
Um, too bad about all
the fascists, though.

637
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,917
- Excuse me?

638
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,583
- Oh, the fascists,
like Ms. Davis over here.

639
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,958
Uh, if it wasn't for them,
I'd be having a fantastic time.

640
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,895
And the kids are great,
like that gentleman Skip.

641
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,159
Skip seems really nice.

642
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,565
- He says that he doesn't
actually know you.

643
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,569
- That is correct.
- But you know him?

644
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,072
- No.
- So you were just

645
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,335
demonstrating solidarity with him?

646
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,206
- Yes, that's right.

647
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,173
(Sighing)

648
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,910
- Do you understand why
you've been given detentions

649
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,383
for the rest of the week?

650
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,522
- Yes, I believe for insolence.

651
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,920
- You're damn right.
- Ms. Davis.

652
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,726
Leon...

653
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,863
I don't think
I've properly educated you

654
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:17,195
on the twin subjects of
who I am and what I'm about.

655
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,064
- I think I've got
a pretty clear idea.

656
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,468
- I don't think that you do.

657
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,609
This has been
a troubled arts school

658
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,142
for many years now.

659
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,906
Pot, sex,

660
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,606
graffiti, piercings.

661
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,376
You see what I'm getting at?

662
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:38,249
I am here to discipline
the students,

663
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,414
usher in a new era

664
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,049
of responsibility
and obligation to this place.

665
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,220
Now, you can certainly
make that harder for me.

666
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,333
Heck, you already have.

667
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,264
But you won't stop me.

668
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,034
So the choice is yours.

669
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,074
You can spend
your final year of high school

670
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:03,009
in a war you can't win against a man
who's lived far longer

671
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,206
and knows far more than you.

672
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,750
- Hmm.

673
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,918
- Or you can just float by
and wreak havoc next year

674
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:16,322
on someone's poor,
unsuspecting university.

675
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,523
What's it going to be?

676
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,466
- I think the choice is obvious.

677
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,038
- Why was this war so important

678
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:31,004
that people were coming
from all over the world to Spain

679
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,199
to volunteer for it?

680
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,607
(Snoring)
Does anyone care?

681
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,076
Anyone other than Leon?

682
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,579
Orwell, Hemingway,

683
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,946
famous writers, lots to lose,

684
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,180
coming all the way to Spain!
They had nothing to do with it.

685
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,216
The POUM, the very first
all-volunteer army.

686
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,055
You, in your little lives here,

687
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,993
would you volunteer yourselves
to go to a foreign country,

688
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,133
somewhere that
you've never been before,

689
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,393
somewhere where
you know no one?

690
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,560
Can you imagine
doing something so selfless?

691
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,968
Dan!

692
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,076
Can you please turn your
smirking face towards the front?

693
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,542
Thanks. Where was I?

694
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,878
(Sighing)
- I'm so bored.

695
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,280
- Well, you're a fruit.
And why are we in the hallway?

696
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,977
Why don't we go somewhere
where we could smoke?

697
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,179
- I'd second that motion,

698
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,586
but I'm afraid it might
sound too fruity, twat.

699
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,387
- Ladies! It's a dance theme.

700
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,085
How hard can this be?

701
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,161
- Pfft!

702
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,528
- OK, so the next suggestion,

703
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,862
whatever it is,
that's what we're doing, OK?

704
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,868
(Sighing)
- Hi! Hi! Sorry.

705
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,269
Sorry we're late.
Double time.

706
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,466
Double time.

707
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,043
- Who's this?

708
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,577
- (Caroline):
Uh, guys, this is Leon

709
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,614
and his friend...
- Skip. His name is Skip.

710
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,182
- Skip!

711
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,613
(Giggles)

712
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,722
Uh, guys, this is Dwight,
president of the Student Union.

713
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,284
- And-and-and-
and who are you?

714
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,122
- Dwight!
- What's the big deal?

715
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,355
What grade are you in, Skippy?

716
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,896
- 9.

717
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,260
- 9! Great!
- Wow!

718
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,925
- All the grades should be
represented in the union.

719
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,093
Right, Tony?
- Right.

720
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,069
Do you guys have any ideas
for the theme of a dance?

721
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,232
It's in 2 weeks and
it's kind of crunch time.

722
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,105
- Social justice?

723
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,041
- All right!
This meeting's adjourned!

724
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,774
- What? Uh, no, no.
No, that's not our theme!

725
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,008
That's not our theme.

726
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,017
- Oh, yeah Caroline said
the next one mentioned

727
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,552
was gonna be the theme,
so that's it, right?

728
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,417
- Hum... I guess, so.

729
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,027
- OK, an elected committee
member has to suggest it.

730
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,388
Not...

731
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,224
some outsider.

732
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,299
- Are you my Stalin, Dwight?

733
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,060
(Snickering)

734
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,295
- Ha! OK!

735
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,962
Um, so I suggest social justice.

736
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,904
Let's fucking go.

737
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,168
(Chuckling)

738
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,868
(Clears throat)

739
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,535
(Makes a raspberry)

740
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,705
- Yeah, well you-

741
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,182
(Caroline giggling)

742
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,183
- "Are you my Stalin, Dwight?"

743
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,047
In fact, I want that on a T-shirt.

744
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,349
- Heh!

745
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,618
- No, wait. That should be
my first album name:

746
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,851
" My Stalin. "

747
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,962
Is it a better band name
or album name?

748
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,428
- I don't know.
- Can I ask you guys something?

749
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,728
Would you say
"boredom" or "apathy"?

750
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,264
- Well, what's the difference?

751
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,932
- Boredom.

752
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,011
- Apathy's the condition
of not caring.

753
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,910
Boredom... boredom is just a
slumber one can be roused from.

754
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,949
- (Tony): Oh, then definitely boredom.
- (Caroline): See, I told you.

755
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,553
(Scoffs)
- Gang...

756
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,053
Do you guys want to form
a real union?

757
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,921
- (Caroline): Why?
- We have no voice.

758
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,619
We have no, uh, defence

759
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,856
in this large,
impersonal establishment

760
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,059
that maintains it's here
for our edification,

761
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,965
and yet seems hell-bent

762
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:51,165
on thwarting our individual and
collective growth at every turn.

763
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,570
(Cheering)

764
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,473
Teachers and administration
are here for us.

765
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,547
And yet we are
the most undervalued members

766
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,547
of the education community.

767
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,949
We have lots of power,
we just haven't used it yet.

768
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,952
- Are we gonna get
in trouble for this?

769
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,385
- Probably.
Heh!

770
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,584
- Principal Berkhoff
claims there's a new sheriff

771
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,458
at Montreal West High School.
Bully for him!

772
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,863
(Men singing in Russian)

773
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:22,233
- What is this fucking idiot
talking about?

774
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,898
Why don't you try listening to him?

775
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,545
- Let's show him what
the townspeople are made of.

776
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:32,342
Let's show him that we are not
the generation of apathy.

777
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,110
- I love everything
you're saying.

778
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,880
Oh, sing it, sister!
Yeah!

779
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,622
- If we don't think
we deserve a detention,

780
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,260
shouldn't we be allowed
to bring that query

781
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,918
to a review board of sorts?

782
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,588
We are entitled
to fight unfair rules.

783
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,790
(Sighing)

784
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:53,027
- High school.: a time for learning
or a time for revolution.

785
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,603
- Oh, mon Dieu!
Frank?

786
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,899
- For one young man,
the answer is both.

787
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,939
- Frank, come here.
You gotta see this.

788
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,704
- What?
- My fellow students,

789
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,712
aren't you tired of being
taught ecology by gym teachers?

790
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,281
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

791
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,975
- While school officials
have yet to comment,

792
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,178
it seems like this semester
is shaping up...

793
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,879
- Should I Febreeze your robes?

794
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,457
(Laughing)

795
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,457
- You know what else
isn't funny anymore?

796
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,925
- Besides your ring tone?

797
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,961
(Hockey Night in Canada theme
ring tone )

798
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,258
- Yeah, you. Hello?

799
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,094
- Turn on the news.

800
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,293
- Why?
- You'll see.

801
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,030
- The commissioner's
on vacation this week...

802
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,572
- Oh my god!
(Beeping)

803
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,108
- Hold on a second.
I got the other line. Hold on.

804
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,872
Hello?
- Uh, hey. It's Leon.

805
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,073
- Hang on.
- Yeah, OK.

806
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,844
- Did you give Leon my number?

807
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:45,921
- Uh...
- Oh, my god! Hold on.

808
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,580
What is wrong with you?

809
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,487
- Why?
Was I not supposed to call?

810
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,629
- No, I'm talking about the-
the school thing!

811
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,287
Are you watching the news,
Leon?

812
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,399
- Oh, that.
That's just local coverage.

813
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,899
Listen, uh, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

814
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,230
- I'm busy.

815
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,895
Are you really trying
to unionize your high school?

816
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,939
- Uh, yes.
Uh, what are you busy with?

817
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,805
- It's my Ph. D. party.
Did you tip off the press?

818
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,343
- Uh, no.
My sister did that.

819
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,107
What-what time
does your Ph. D. party finish?

820
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,409
(Speaking, indistinct)

821
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,313
- Late.
What is wrong with you?

822
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,421
- I'm Trotsky.
Uh, how late is late?

823
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,286
- Um, we're not seeing
each other tomorrow night, so...

824
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,394
- But tomorrow is
our anniversary.

825
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,826
- Mmm, we don't have
an anniversary.

826
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,830
- Yes, we do.
It's a week tomorrow that we first met.

827
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,934
- OK, I'm gonna talk to you later.

828
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,936
And I don't want to be
your one phone call from jail.

829
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,870
- So, I'll just pop by
your place tomorrow night, then?

830
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,976
- You will the fuck not, seriously.

831
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,081
(Dial tone )

832
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,177
(Sighing)

833
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,582
(Coughing)

834
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,618
(Sniffing)

835
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,091
- Smells good in here.

836
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,559
- How's your boyfriend?

837
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,357
I forgot.
I'm your boyfriend.

838
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,429
- Yeah, sometimes
I forget too.

839
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,194
(Sighing)

840
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,999
- Congratulations, Doctor.

841
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,108
- Whoa!
- Thank you!

842
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,265
- Bravo.
- Merci! Oh...

843
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,502
- You didn't call me-

844
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,509
- I'm not talking to you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

845
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,012
You didn't call me back.
You left me hangin' there.

846
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,514
What did that Leon have to say?

847
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,618
- You guys are terrible!
Leave her alone.

848
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,015
(Frank laughing)

849
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,952
- It is not my fault that he has
a crush on me, OK?

850
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,615
- Well, how's Julian doing
with the old competition?

851
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,762
- Yeah, it's none of
his business anymore.

852
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,864
- Whoa, whoa! Is there
something I should know?

853
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,727
- Yeah, she kicked him out yesterday.

854
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,461
- Shit, is he here?
- Let her have a drink or two.

855
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,695
- I can hear you.

856
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,203
(Laughing)
- Thank you.

857
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,740
- Oh, merci!
- Good night, girls.

858
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,071
- Merci, Marie.
(Both laughing)

859
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,270
Good night.
- I love her!

860
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,712
- I totally "effed" an 18 year old.

861
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,875
- Yeah, so did I, when I was 14.

862
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,850
- No, I mean like recently.

863
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,717
- Shut your "fugly" face.

864
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,517
(Laughing)
- No, I did!

865
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:02,681
- Who?

866
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,794
- Remember that kid
I was tutoring?

867
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,263
- You didn't!

868
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,023
Timmy?

869
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,724
- (Laughing): I did.

870
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,802
- How am I only hearing
about this now, whore?

871
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,268
What was it like?

872
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,964
- Uh, well, let's put it this way.

873
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,203
They fuck you very quickly
but a lot.

874
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,903
- Really?

875
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,048
(Inhales)

876
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,343
- He came so many times
I lost count.

877
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,418
- That's disgusting.

878
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,781
(Giggling)

879
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,388
- You are so horny for that kid.

880
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,751
- No.
- Yes, you are.

881
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,756
- I gotta kind of move
this face back to...

882
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,895
(Growling)
(Laughing)

883
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:56,073
(Slurring):
You son of a bitch.

884
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,830
(Loud thudding, grunting)

885
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,267
Oops.
(Groaning)

886
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,404
Oh shit!

887
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:00,866
(Thunder)

888
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,013
(Sniffling)
- Thanks.

889
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,876
(Whispering): Ouch. Ouch, ouch.

890
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,245
- Sorry, I thought
you were a burglar.

891
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,752
- No, you didn't.

892
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,016
- No, clearly I thought
you were a cartoon character.

893
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,454
I'm sorry.

894
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,255
No one's ever broken
into my house before.

895
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,229
- Congratulations on your Ph. D.

896
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,393
- (Laughing)
You're so fucking nuts, Leon.

897
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,768
- Please!
Nah, don't say that.

898
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,738
You don't actually think that,
do you?

899
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,877
'Cause...

900
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:41,108
I don't usually care of what
anybody thinks of me. Obviously.

901
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,378
Um, but...

902
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,401
I'm just very determined.

903
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,200
(Sighing)

904
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,581
(Birds chirping)

905
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,887
- (Whispering): Oh.

906
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,818
Oh please, God.
No.

907
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,288
(Thudding and rattling)

908
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,351
Oh, fuck.

909
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,130
(Cup hits table)

910
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,773
(Leon sighing)

911
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,175
- Uh, hi there.

912
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,943
I- I took the liberty
of making up some coffee.

913
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,916
I hope that's OK.

914
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,082
- It's fine.

915
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,559
- Here you go.

916
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,524
I love you.
- I don't do sugar.

917
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,997
- OK.

918
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:44,932
- What time is it?

919
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,509
- It's 9:53.
We have to leave pretty soon.

920
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:51,944
I was entertaining the idea
of trying to wake you up myself.

921
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,916
- Where are we going?

922
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,677
- Uh, E Talk.

923
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,014
- What?

924
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,884
- I already told you.
My E Talk Daily interview.

925
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:04,459
I'm due there in about 45 minutes.

926
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:05,754
So, uh...

927
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,227
Do you think
you need a shower?

928
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,027
- I said I would go?

929
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,629
(Buzzing)

930
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,967
- Hi.
- (Man): Bobby!

931
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,242
- Don't be nervous.
- Oh, I'm not. I'm not.

932
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,813
I just didn't think
it would actually be you

933
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:26,950
conducting the interview.

934
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,348
- I'm flattered.
- That's not what I meant.

935
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,045
- Ben, we're ready in 5,

936
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,680
4, 3, 2...

937
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,760
- Today, we are talking to
an extraordinary young man

938
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,659
named Leon Bronstein.
Leon staged a massive strike

939
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,300
at his father's Montreal factory
this summer

940
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,402
to try to unionize
the workers there.

941
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,834
And now, he's doing
the same thing

942
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,871
at his high school
in Montreal West.

943
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,168
Welcome, Leon.
- Uh, thank you, Ben.

944
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,436
Uh, it's an honour to be-
An honour to be here.

945
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,045
- Let's start with a question

946
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,375
I think most people
would want to ask you first.

947
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,111
Why do you think high school
should be unionized?

948
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,619
- Uh, I think
we deserve a voice.

949
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,120
I mean, teachers
have a union

950
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,782
to ensure that
their rights are protected.

951
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,257
I think we deserve the same.

952
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:15,194
Uh, just think.
Had there been a student union

953
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,026
in, say, Newfoundland,

954
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,193
we never would've had
the boys of St. Vincent.

955
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:24,770
- Uh, um, I'm sorry.

956
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,775
Are you saying that
there's sexual abuse

957
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,970
at your high school?
- Oh, no, no, no.

958
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,741
I'm merely being hyperbolic
to prove a point.

959
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:35,384
I'd say the bulk
of today's adolescents

960
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,817
tend to feel that
they have no one to talk to.

961
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,923
Now imagine, if you will,

962
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:44,185
a review board of peers

963
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,762
to listen to set issues
and assess them accordingly.

964
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,330
- OK.

965
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,796
So, so you want a union

966
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:54,699
to try to help students deal
with feelings of alienation?

967
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,841
- Well, kind of, Ben. I think that
a large part of the reason why

968
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,737
today's youth seems
so disaffected-

969
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:00,842
are so disaffected-

970
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,673
is because they really have
so little control...

971
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:04,779
- Are you his mother?

972
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:08,315
- ... over the major aspects
of their day-to-day lives.

973
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,383
- I'm his lawyer.

974
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,750
- I-I think my last question
for you is this:

975
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,015
Why you?

976
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,820
Why did Leon Bronstein
take up this cause?

977
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,593
- Uh, well,

978
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,665
I'm not sure if
you're aware of this, Ben,

979
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:27,702
but Leon Bronstein is actually
the birth name of Leon Trotsky.

980
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:28,963
- Can we cut? Cut!
Couper!

981
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,629
Stop the tape.

982
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,401
Um, don't say that, Leon.
Just don't.

983
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,602
- Wait, don't say what?
Don't say what?

984
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,804
- Ah, come on, Alex.
I have to be true to myself.

985
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,243
- On E Talk?

986
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,906
- Who are you?
- She's my-

987
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,712
- Lawyer, Ben.
I am his lawyer.

988
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,912
And I don't want him
talking to you anymore.

989
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,078
Come on.
- Now?

990
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,315
- Done.

991
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,488
- I'm sorry, Ben.

992
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,728
- I was trying to help you.

993
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:56,831
- I know.

994
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,896
- Listen, um, I don't think you
should come back to my place.

995
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,564
- Why not?

996
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,108
- Because we can't.

997
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,609
I...

998
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,714
Last night was wrong.

999
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,680
I- I was drunk.

1000
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,910
And I didn't know
what I was doing.

1001
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,248
- So, wh-what the hell
are you afraid of?

1002
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,755
Huh?
Letting somebody love you?

1003
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,620
- Oh, Jesus, you're schmaltzy.

1004
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,989
No, Leon, I'm afraid
of who will play me

1005
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,653
in the TV movie about us.

1006
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,628
- But it's fate. It's not up to us.

1007
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,631
- OK, I don't live my life that way.

1008
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,700
I can't.

1009
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,269
And I can't do this either, so...

1010
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,633
(Sighing)

1011
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,434
I'm sorry if I led you on.

1012
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,808
- Fine. Fine...

1013
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,844
No. No. No.
- I'll get out.

1014
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,650
- I'm still in love with you, OK?

1015
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,791
You don't get a say in that.

1016
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,861
(Sighing)

1017
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,422
- Kids, eh?

1018
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,018
(The Stills singing
Don't Talk Down)

1019
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,286
Don't

1020
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,954
Don't talk down

1021
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,261
To me

1022
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,806
Don't

1023
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:48,001
Don't talk down

1024
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,744
To me

1025
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,751
Your head is moving side to side

1026
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,721
Your head is moving side to side

1027
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,885
Our temperatures rise

1028
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:10,193
I hear the devil outside

1029
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,829
You're heading north

1030
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:19,672
Well I'm heading south

1031
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:23,301
Well I hope the words are right

1032
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,382
When they leave your mouth

1033
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,788
Oh

1034
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:36,858
Well I'm better off now

1035
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,392
Oh

1036
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:40,825
(Music stops )

1037
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,031
(All talking)

1038
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,467
- Have fun.

1039
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,305
One second.

1040
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:58,746
- Take it. Run.

1041
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,348
Bring me back a drink.

1042
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:01,814
- Uh, OK.

1043
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,316
- It's me again.
Hi.

1044
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,217
- Come on, students,
it's your future.

1045
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,949
Face it!
Join the movement.

1046
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,957
OK, so, uh...

1047
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,425
Who are you, guys?

1048
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,893
- We're Animal Farm.

1049
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,692
- He's Clover.
Hello?

1050
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,095
- OK, that is too much effort.

1051
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,099
It's high school.
And you're a pig.

1052
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,135
- Correct.
- OK.

1053
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,739
Hey, uh... How's the count?

1054
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,843
- It's good.
It's uh, 300 signatures thus far.

1055
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,171
- Wow! That's great.

1056
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,711
- It's incredible.

1057
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,179
- Leon?
- Aw, great!

1058
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,285
- A girl dressed as Ayn Rand
just told me that you threw her out.

1059
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,182
- Yeah.

1060
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,789
And?

1061
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,085
- Why?

1062
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,786
- This is a
fascist-free zone, Dwight.

1063
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,193
Maybe you should leave as well.

1064
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,630
- OK, yeah. Throw another
fucking kid out, Leon,

1065
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,531
and you are next.
- OK. Easy, Dwight.

1066
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,729
All right? Ayn snuck back in.
She's in the gym.

1067
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,205
- Yeah, Dwight, go back
to the candy stand.

1068
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,809
- What you say, Skippy?

1069
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,309
- Oh god.
- You wanna fucking die?

1070
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,812
- OK, please, Dwight.
We are trying to work.

1071
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,449
- Well, fuck you, man!

1072
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,278
- Awesome! Please go.

1073
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,185
- Hi!
- Hi!

1074
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,551
- I'm not gonna stay long.

1075
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,817
- What?
Yes, yes, you are.

1076
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,826
Yes, you are.
You're going to have fun.

1077
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,260
Skip!

1078
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,062
This is my sister, Sarah.

1079
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,034
Sarah, this is Skip.

1080
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,174
Sarah doesn't know anyone here,

1081
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,968
so why don't you ask her
to dance

1082
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,077
and talk to her
and stuff like that?

1083
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,477
- You wanna dance?

1084
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,380
- Sure.

1085
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,431
- Thank you.

1086
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,634
- You're an interesting guy, Leon.

1087
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,332
- Thank you.

1088
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,807
(Hip hop)

1089
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,682
- Oh!

1090
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,020
Hello, gorgeous!

1091
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:32,867
Oh, hey! Are you the girl
who spiked the punch?

1092
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,594
- Mmm!
No, I just got here.

1093
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,103
- Oh, man! I'm trying
to figure out who to thank.

1094
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,504
(Laughing)
Whoo!

1095
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,471
I totally have to date this DJ.

1096
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,707
Anyway, you two kids
have fun, OK?

1097
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,477
Bye!
I'm going this way!

1098
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,862
- Uh-huh.

1099
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,262
- And now all
the party people are here.

1100
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,766
- Oh, uh, please don't
spoil it for me.

1101
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,837
Let me venture a guess.
You are the Ceausescus!

1102
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:11,166
Oh no, wait a second.

1103
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:15,107
It's-it's got to be, uh,
Oliver Stone and an Asian woman?

1104
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,372
Am I getting warmer?
- Very clever, Leon.

1105
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,175
- Uh-huh.

1106
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,113
- So, social justice, eh?

1107
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,650
Interesting theme.

1108
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,254
- Mm-hmm!
Whose idea was that, I wonder?

1109
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,220
- Uh, I actually tabled the idea.

1110
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:31,417
- Is there no little devil
whispering in your ear, Tony?

1111
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,358
- Caught you on E Talk
the other day, Leon.

1112
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,158
You're getting pretty famous.

1113
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,164
- Well, as long as the cause receives

1114
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,393
the appropriate attention.

1115
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:40,866
- You watch E Talk, sir?

1116
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,938
- That's right. I do.

1117
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:51,136
Anyhoo, we need to have
a meeting with you

1118
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,804
and I guess with you, Tony,

1119
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,678
and anyone else who wants
to come along,

1120
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,911
about your so-called movement.

1121
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,856
Monday.
After school.

1122
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,423
- I'll be there.

1123
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:09,362
- I was speaking with
the school board on Friday

1124
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,624
about your little cause.

1125
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,324
Just so you know,

1126
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,697
it might be getting a lot of
attention from the media

1127
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,862
but it will never happen.
- Is that it?

1128
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,064
- Wait a minute.

1129
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,004
What do you mean
it's never gonna happen?

1130
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,803
- Yeah, we have over
450 signatures.

1131
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,947
- Comrades, comrades by even
talking to this brown shirt,

1132
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:27,913
you're-you're-you're merely,
uh, encouraging him.

1133
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,211
He truthfully has very little power;

1134
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,820
he's only trying to scare us.

1135
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:35,116
- Mr. Bronstein,
I actually have a lot of power

1136
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,782
and I happen to be wearing
a grey shirt.

1137
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,394
(Giggles)

1138
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,689
- Caroline, will you please
tell Mr. Berkhoff

1139
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,765
that the next time
I'll be speaking with him

1140
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,764
will be at
the school board meeting

1141
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,096
in the presence of
the Student Union legal team.

1142
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:51,172
- You won't be allowed into
the meeting, Leon.

1143
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,309
Administration only.

1144
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,868
- Well, we'll see about that.

1145
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,873
And that amounts to
a threat, does it not,

1146
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,847
saying that they won't
let it happen?

1147
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,681
- OK, OK. When is this meeting
gonna take place?

1148
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:06,822
- Tomorrow afternoon.

1149
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:07,922
Thank you.

1150
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,753
- At the school board?
With the commissioner there?

1151
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,690
- Yes. And one other
teensy little thing.

1152
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,330
Uh, technically, we are not
allowed to be there.

1153
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,329
So we're crashing the party,

1154
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,630
in the grand Bolshevik tradition
of crashing everything.

1155
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,830
- I presumed you've
alerted the media.

1156
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,235
- Yeah, of course.

1157
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,273
Uh, and I figured since
you used to be married

1158
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,911
to Commissioner Archambault-

1159
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,638
Speaking of which, I saw
the pictures from that wedding.

1160
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,306
- Hey. Leon.
- How drunk was Maggie Trudeau?

1161
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:35,781
- Leon.
- What?

1162
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,817
- I'm not a prop.

1163
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,181
- What do you mean?

1164
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:40,982
- I won't show up
any time you want me

1165
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,818
just to lend you some credibility.

1166
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,017
- I don't need credibility.

1167
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,220
- You don't need a lawyer either.

1168
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,493
(Sighing)

1169
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,138
- Leon.

1170
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,243
- I'm here on business,
I promise you.

1171
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,605
- What business?

1172
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:03,677
- Uh, legal stuff.

1173
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,873
Tomorrow afternoon,
there's a school board meeting.

1174
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:07,948
- I can't.

1175
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,244
- Why not?

1176
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,217
- Because I can't!
I'm not your lawyer.

1177
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:14,322
- OK, fine, let's just...

1178
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,389
(Sighing)

1179
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,651
...put our love aside
for a moment

1180
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,954
and deal with the cause, OK?

1181
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:21,153
- "Our love," Leon?

1182
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,323
"Our love" is something
you made up in your head, OK?

1183
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,435
I don't love you.

1184
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,730
And, seriously,
you should think long and hard

1185
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,805
about whether or not
you love me,

1186
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,339
because I don't think you do.

1187
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,874
- Aw!

1188
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,842
You are a coward.

1189
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,776
- Oh, fuck you, Leon!

1190
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,212
I'm allowed to feel used
when someone is using me.

1191
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:42,510
- You think I'm using you?

1192
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,085
- Of course I do!
You are!

1193
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,016
- I had no idea you had such
a poor opinion of me.

1194
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,491
- Oh, my god!

1195
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,028
Enough with the broken-hearted
puppy-dog routine.

1196
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,190
You just feel things because
you think you're supposed to.

1197
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,302
You've never had
a real emotion in your life.

1198
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,732
You need to grow up.

1199
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,338
(Scoffing)

1200
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,975
(Dog barking in distance )

1201
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:24,150
(Violin)

1202
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,861
(Baby cooing)

1203
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,090
(Baby cooing)

1204
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,870
(Gasps )

1205
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,266
- Aw!

1206
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,137
God, I hate that fucking dream!

1207
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:21,581
- Students.

1208
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,780
- Press corps!

1209
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,548
See you guys after our meeting.

1210
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,089
It shouldn't be more than... 10.

1211
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,190
How's tricks?

1212
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,726
- You're wasting your time,
Mr. Bronstein.

1213
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:36,160
- Uh, funny.
I feel like I'm wasting yours.

1214
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:39,267
So, uh, see you guys inside?

1215
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,733
Lovely.
Lovely ensemble.

1216
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,407
- I notice there's some
new faces here.

1217
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,978
- Uh, Denise...

1218
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,308
They bullied their way
into this meeting.

1219
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,010
- Oh, and how exactly
were you bullied, Harry?

1220
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,653
Were you swarmed?

1221
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,083
(People chuckling)

1222
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:01,621
Let's get this over with

1223
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:05,022
so we can get into
the real business of this meeting.

1224
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,661
Let me guess.

1225
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:11,289
Monsieur Bronstein will speak
on behalf of this group?

1226
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,694
- Uh, yes.
That's right, Denise.

1227
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:17,032
I assume you already know
why we're here.

1228
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,232
I have in my hand
more than 578 signatures

1229
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:24,471
of students from my high school
who wish to unionize.

1230
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:28,048
- And I wonder
how you got those signatures,

1231
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,775
Monsieur Bronstein.

1232
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:33,080
By pretending it was
for installing a Jacuzzi

1233
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,486
in the hallway?

1234
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:38,957
(Adults laughing)
- I see that I'm encountering

1235
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,095
that legendary school board wit

1236
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,787
that I've heard so much about.

1237
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,228
Uh, in that case,
I'll just get down to business.

1238
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,892
Uh, we're here because
Henry Berkhoff

1239
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,868
and his...

1240
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,239
demonic concubine, Davis...

1241
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:57,505
- You won't get anywhere with
insolence, Monsieur Bronstein.

1242
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:03,383
- Thus,
we have come before you...

1243
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,781
(Mic feedback)

1244
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,683
...oh great and powerful Oz,

1245
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,724
uh, in search of understanding
andlor benevolence.

1246
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,656
What say you?

1247
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,196
- Insolence again,
Monsieur Bronstein.

1248
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:20,199
You know, perhaps you are not

1249
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,803
the best spokesperson
for your cause.

1250
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,837
En tout cas...

1251
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,497
- (Whispering):
What a fucking surprise.

1252
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,701
- Excuse me?

1253
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:32,575
- This is a formality, Madame.

1254
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,717
A mere formality.

1255
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,148
Did you honestly think
that any of us believed

1256
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,754
that you would
actually take us seriously?

1257
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,049
You and your, uh,
junta school board

1258
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:46,059
are more predictable
than a Congolese dictator.

1259
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:49,392
Uh, no, we-we are only here
to give the impression

1260
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,726
that we were willing
to talk sensibly

1261
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:55,701
before raining down a
hellfire of shit on your legacy!

1262
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:56,930
- Monsieur Bronstein!

1263
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:02,244
I spent today
as I spend most days...

1264
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:06,370
working for
the Stephen Lewis Foundation

1265
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:10,610
trying to convince
pharmaceutical companies

1266
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,848
to donate AIDS drugs
to Botswana.

1267
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:16,457
So you'll excuse me

1268
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,323
if I have low tolerance
for your histrionics.

1269
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,726
- I'm sincerely sorry
that our little cause

1270
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,891
isn't dramatic enough for you.

1271
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,433
Let's go, gang.

1272
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,299
Downstairs, we have
a press conference awaiting us.

1273
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:37,142
- Un instant, s'il te plaît,
Monsieur Bronstein.

1274
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:44,279
I can only assume you're
planning a strike of some kind.

1275
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,913
But I must warn you,

1276
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:50,286
this is not your daddy's factory;

1277
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:54,361
this is the government.

1278
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,690
Do you know what happens
to government workers

1279
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,335
who strike illegally?

1280
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,896
They go to jail.

1281
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,267
- What you seem to forget,
Madame,

1282
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,001
is that we are not
government employees,

1283
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,542
we are not your employees.

1284
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:10,906
We are students.

1285
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,674
Just like those students
in that square in China.

1286
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,411
And my name is Mr. Trotsky.

1287
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,146
Leon Trotsky.

1288
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,815
Adieu.

1289
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,564
(Berkhoff talking, indistinct)

1290
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,935
- Here we go.
- I'll do the wrap later.

1291
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,573
- What was that?
'cause I don't want to go to jail.

1292
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,005
- Yeah, I'm not too crazy
about that idea either.

1293
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,644
I mean, detentions suck and all,

1294
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,610
but I bet getting gang-raped
by prison guards sucks harder.

1295
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:46,839
- Nobody's going to jail!

1296
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,007
They're just trying to,
uh, distract us.

1297
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,210
Sarah, I think it's time
for the sympathy strike.

1298
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,480
- I've already been
laying down the foundations.

1299
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,055
- You have?
- Yeah.

1300
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,556
- Wow.
(Leon clearing throat)

1301
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,854
- All right,
I'm gonna deal with the press.

1302
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,291
(Clearing throat)

1303
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,125
Afternoon, press corps.

1304
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,527
We're calling for

1305
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,032
a school-board-wide strike
of all students

1306
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,103
at 11.:30 a. m.,
Eastern standard time.

1307
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,740
Tomorrow morning,
students, walk out of class.

1308
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,273
Walk into the streets

1309
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,966
and we will show them

1310
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:18,079
that we are alive,
we are awake, we are aware.

1311
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,977
- (Man): Uh, Leon, why exactly
are you doing this strike?

1312
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,482
- We are striking over
self-determination.

1313
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,053
How's that?
Believe it or not,

1314
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:29,419
yes, our educational environment
is important to us.

1315
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:34,052
So once again, students,
11.:30 a. m. tomorrow morning,

1316
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,857
let this strike commence.

1317
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,263
- Idle threats orjust
the beginning, we'll find out-

1318
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,386
- Leon, maybe you'd like
to share with the family

1319
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:03,821
how you're adapting
to your new public school?

1320
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,255
No? Come on!

1321
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:06,588
Nothing, uh, interesting,

1322
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,093
nothing provocative happened,

1323
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,925
nothing worthy of your attention?

1324
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,498
Today, for instance?

1325
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,498
- You are so
fucking busted, dipshit.

1326
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,068
- One son at a time.

1327
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:22,371
- Sarah, will you please
remind your father

1328
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,944
that I'm not
speaking with him.

1329
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:26,104
- Leon says-
- Oh, of course!

1330
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:29,012
Because of this historical record here.

1331
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,780
Your Leon stopped talking to
his father at exactly your age.

1332
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,219
Isn't that right? Is it?

1333
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,256
Just nod your head vaguely
in my direction.

1334
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:40,293
- Question: did Leon Trotsky
make his whole family

1335
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,158
the laughing stock of the city?

1336
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,390
- It's half the city.
The French don't care.

1337
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:45,864
- You live in the West Island!

1338
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,969
- Actually, Dollard.
- Just so that I know

1339
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,764
what to expect between us, Leon,

1340
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,998
you mind telling me
what chapters I can skip,

1341
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,039
so I can get to
the relevant parts?

1342
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,974
'Cause most of this
is incredibly boring!

1343
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,738
- David!
- Stop reading that book.

1344
01:06:58,914 --> 01:06:59,972
- Why?

1345
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,174
I'm finding out so much
about both of you.

1346
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,784
- Well, it's too late!

1347
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,215
You can't wake up one morning

1348
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,356
and decide now to take
an interest in my life!

1349
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,957
Goddamn it! I'm not supposed
to be talking with you!

1350
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,855
- Oh, poor baby!

1351
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,326
- I asked you
not to talk about this.

1352
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,729
(Scoffing)

1353
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:22,996
- Dad, he's totally out of control.

1354
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,197
- Eli!
- What? He's my brother.

1355
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,534
I can say what I want.

1356
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,176
(Baby cooing)

1357
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,971
(Knocking)

1358
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,273
- (Anna): Leon, are you OK?

1359
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,609
Come and have dessert, honey.

1360
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,012
(Sighing)

1361
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,243
- Come on, Toronto.

1362
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,084
Don't let me down.

1363
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,727
Hello?
Is this Mr. Ulianov?

1364
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:50,059
Is this Mr. Vladimir Ulianov?

1365
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,224
It's ei- It's either
your name or it isn't, sir.

1366
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,767
It's a simple question.

1367
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:57,064
Fantastic.
How-how old are you, sir?

1368
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:00,538
I understand why you think
it's none of my business,

1369
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:01,937
but humour me?

1370
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,874
You're 73. That's, uh...

1371
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:07,607
Your children should come
to visit you more often.

1372
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:09,546
OK, OK...
Yeah?

1373
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:10,878
Hello, ma'am.

1374
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:13,078
Uh, I'm looking for Vladimir Ulianov.

1375
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:16,249
That's you.

1376
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:17,915
Hello?

1377
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,857
Is your name Vladimir Ulianov?

1378
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,758
No? Thank you!

1379
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,057
Thanks for nothing.

1380
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:28,060
(Violin screeching)

1381
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:30,205
(Playing badly)

1382
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,206
(Phone ringing)

1383
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:37,436
- Yes?

1384
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,638
- (Davis):
The eagle has landed.

1385
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,442
- Thank you.

1386
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,281
- Can't believe
he wants us to leave.

1387
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,479
- Are you gonna do it?
- Yeah, probably...

1388
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,954
- (Boy 1 ): So are you gonna
walk out at 11:30?

1389
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,150
- (Boy 2): Yeah.

1390
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,456
- Good morning, gentlemen.

1391
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,927
- (British accent): Oof!
Not for you, it isn't.

1392
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,190
(Snickering)

1393
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,266
- OK. All right,
how much trouble

1394
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,306
do you think we'll get in
for doing this?

1395
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,443
- Dwight!
- What?

1396
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,010
I have a right to know.

1397
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,874
- You're not going
to get in trouble.

1398
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,446
I've already taken the fall.

1399
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,277
Listen.
Have we gotten the word out?

1400
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,419
Does everybody know?
Is this going to happen?

1401
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:20,111
- Everybody is talking
about it, so everybody knows.

1402
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:21,620
The only thing
I'm worried about

1403
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,623
is that no one will want to be
the first person to walk out.

1404
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,590
- I know but they'll hear us
in the hallways.

1405
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,389
That'll put some hair
on their balls.

1406
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:29,496
We're gonna be fine.

1407
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,599
- I don't like this.
- Then please leave.

1408
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,826
- Yeah, that's great idea.
What if I do leave?

1409
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,403
What if I go straight
to Berkhoff's office,

1410
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:38,836
let him know
what all you guys are planning?

1411
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,032
Smart ass!

1412
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,769
- I held a press conference.
I'm pretty sure he knows.

1413
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,207
- You're stupid, Dwight.

1414
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,211
- Fuck it!
That's it, you stupid-

1415
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:47,679
- Hey! Whoa!
- Seriously!

1416
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:51,481
(Sighing)

1417
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,954
(Chuckles)

1418
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,023
- You seem fairly calm, Henry.

1419
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,454
- I am.

1420
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,059
- How?

1421
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:02,129
- What do you think is going to
happen when they get outside?

1422
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,061
- What do you mean?

1423
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:07,066
- Well, what do you think
about kids these days, Jeanne?

1424
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,067
Are they bored or apathetic?

1425
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,035
- Well, I don't know.

1426
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,333
- Well, I think I do.

1427
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,568
And I don't think
it's what Leon expects.

1428
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,103
(Phone ringing)

1429
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:22,844
- David.

1430
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,246
Phone.

1431
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:30,181
(Choir singing in Russian)

1432
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,458
(Cell ringing)
- Ooh! Hello?

1433
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:38,557
Oh, hi, Laura.

1434
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,066
No, I just thought
it was somebody else.

1435
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,365
No!

1436
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:46,997
My god! Why would you even think
I'd think it was Leon?

1437
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,370
You're so-
Aw!

1438
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,705
- Alexandra does this
really annoying thing

1439
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,848
where she moves things
with her feet.

1440
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,711
I think it's from being
a ballerina as a child.

1441
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:59,479
A cup of coffee is meant
to be held with a hand.

1442
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,282
Ah!

1443
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:04,119
They're doing a little shuffling
with the curriculum I hear.

1444
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,557
Some of the teachers
are gonna be downsized...

1445
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,424
(Ticking)

1446
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:26,806
(Thudding)

1447
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,423
(Choir singing in Russian)

1448
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,578
- Hmm!

1449
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:45,158
(Malajube singing Pate Filo )

1450
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,705
- OK, let's go!

1451
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,844
Let's move it.
Let's clear the exit!

1452
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:12,912
School progress!
Let's go! Let's go!

1453
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:18,757
This way. This way.

1454
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:21,361
- Leon! Leon!
Stop for a second.

1455
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,498
- No! Mustn't
cease the momentum.

1456
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,296
- Leon! Stop! Stop!

1457
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:27,560
- What?
- Stop!

1458
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:31,764
(Cell ringing)

1459
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,204
(All talking)

1460
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,809
- (Boy): Hey, hold up!
Hold up!

1461
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:37,468
(Sighing)

1462
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,037
- What is this, recess?

1463
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,683
This is supposed
to be a fucking revolution!

1464
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:45,752
- I know American Idol totally
used to be about talent.

1465
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,786
Now, it's all about
who has the best voice.

1466
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:49,014
It's bull shit.

1467
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,159
- Man, what the fuck
are you saying?

1468
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,759
I do too shave my pubes!

1469
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,953
- No, no, dude.
Listen to me.

1470
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,860
I need herbal Oxy cotton!
I'm allergic to chemicals.

1471
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:01,929
- Well, OK.
We'll keep texting about it,

1472
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,765
but I don't feel like talking.

1473
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,177
(Cell phone ringing)

1474
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,439
(Music)

1475
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,252
(Music stops )

1476
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:22,989
(Applause and cheering)

1477
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,156
- (Woman): Thank you.

1478
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:27,819
- Excuse me.

1479
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,123
- I'm gonna do a new one.

1480
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,290
(Piano)

1481
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:36,803
Bottled up slipstreams

1482
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,065
And old broken moonbeams

1483
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:42,176
They won't see us through
till the dawn

1484
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:44,710
(Laura laughing)
- (Alexandra): Shh!

1485
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,748
And you call in the lights
in the royal blue night

1486
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:53,013
And you ask me
to tell you what's wrong

1487
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:57,084
Well crowned kings some days

1488
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,784
Run 6 ways from Sundays

1489
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:04,126
You got your Sunday vest on

1490
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,830
And you'll fix it
You'll find it

1491
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:12,269
This time you'll mind it

1492
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:17,105
But baby I'm already gone...

1493
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,242
- It's all over.

1494
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:23,851
I'm not it.
I'm not the man for the job.

1495
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:27,921
Both my heart and my cause
lie broken and bleeding

1496
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,820
on a basketball diamond
in Montreal West.

1497
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:31,960
- In English, please.

1498
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,288
- Aw, don't talk
to me like that!

1499
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,055
- No, don't talk to me like that!

1500
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:37,664
I don't want the press release.

1501
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,061
- Oh, uh, right, right.

1502
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:42,465
Uh, I forgot, this is all an act.

1503
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:45,163
I- I-I can't feel things.

1504
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,671
I- I-I don't feel anything,

1505
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,776
so I guess this doesn't
bother me at all.

1506
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,377
- No.

1507
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,945
That's not what I meant.

1508
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:53,879
I'm sorry.

1509
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,482
- Alexandra...

1510
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:58,176
I, uh, I don't trust you anymore.

1511
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,052
I don't trust you anymore.

1512
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,747
- ... can't find it

1513
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:08,352
And baby we're already gone

1514
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,794
(Piano)

1515
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:15,433
- (Whispering): Fuck.

1516
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,837
And I'm black and I'm blue

1517
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,134
But I'm still made up of you

1518
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:25,041
And there'sjust
no place left alone

1519
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:29,975
But I go face the grey

1520
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:33,883
Be better some day

1521
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:41,491
And baby I'm already gone

1522
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:55,566
(Applause and cheering)

1523
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:57,837
Thank you.

1524
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,844
- What?

1525
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,783
- I think I'm in love.

1526
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,476
- You are?

1527
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,014
- Apparently.

1528
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:12,621
(Exhaling)

1529
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,785
(People talking
and laughing in distance )

1530
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,794
- Ah!

1531
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,193
Hey, Alex!

1532
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,835
Allô! Ça va?

1533
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:21,992
Mmm! Mmm!

1534
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,762
- Oui!
You look beautiful.

1535
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:24,837
- Oh, thank you.
You too.

1536
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,669
- I brought champagne to
Thanksgiving. Is that weird?

1537
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,811
- There's never
a bad time for champagne.

1538
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,138
- That's what I thought.

1539
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,644
- Uh, Alex?

1540
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:36,944
Listen, um, you've got a bunch
of ex-boyfriends or something

1541
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:38,313
in the kitchen.

1542
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,045
- Oh... OK.

1543
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,213
- Just-just wanted
to let you know.

1544
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:43,323
- Yes, thank you.

1545
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,925
- I'll take that.

1546
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,655
- (Frank): They take any more
money out of History department,

1547
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:50,889
there won't be one left.

1548
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,761
- (Julian):
That's not what I heard.

1549
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,401
I heard Russian studies is gone.

1550
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:55,729
(Laughing)

1551
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:57,769
You find that funny?
- No, it's perfect.

1552
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:00,430
It's a perfect thing to,
uh, give thanks for..

1553
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,610
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

1554
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,612
- Hey.
- Hey!

1555
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:10,684
I thought I'd put this in the fridge.
- Sure.

1556
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:14,344
- Hey, Alex.
You, uh, you look great.

1557
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,150
- Thanks, Julian.

1558
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:17,689
Hi!

1559
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,054
- Hi, Alex.
You-you look great.

1560
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:22,162
- How've you been?

1561
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,662
- I have to go to the washroom.

1562
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:30,800
- Don't worry, guys.

1563
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:34,738
It's slightly more embarrassing
for me than it is for you, so...

1564
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,878
bottom's up.

1565
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:45,217
- Hey!

1566
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,082
- We already did that.

1567
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,813
- OK.

1568
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,652
Uh, I haven't heard
from you in a few weeks.

1569
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:53,988
- I haven't heard from you
in a few weeks either.

1570
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:55,652
- How you been?

1571
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,389
- Not great, but whatever.

1572
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,999
- OK.

1573
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,658
We should, um,
have coffee or something...

1574
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,634
- Oh, please stop.
Please stop this.

1575
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,296
- OK.
I was just trying to-

1576
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,340
- I know-I know
what you're trying to do.

1577
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:12,276
Uh, I would rather not talk to
you at all than talk like this.

1578
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:13,607
- OK, fine.

1579
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,215
- All right.
- Yeah.

1580
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:21,386
- Oh no, it's just that history
is so important that-

1581
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:23,649
- Oh shit, Julian,
if you really feel that way,

1582
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,793
you ought to be doing
something about it.

1583
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:28,623
Like Leon here.
- Yes, good call, Francis.

1584
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:31,766
I'll be his shining example
of utter ineffectiveness.

1585
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:32,922
- It was not ineffective!

1586
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,626
Reason it didn't work, is because
you didn't teach the kids

1587
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:36,896
how to strike properly.

1588
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:38,699
You don't learn it
through osmosis.

1589
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:41,274
You know what I mean?
- You don't.

1590
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,742
- Listen, when I organized
my first be-in against the war,

1591
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,778
a lot was expected of us
at Berkeley, baby.

1592
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,280
That was ground zero.
- You went to Berkeley?

1593
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,009
- Berkeley in those days
was ground zero.

1594
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:52,949
- Ooh!
Can you spell "cliché"?

1595
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,180
- Right in the middle
of the Kennedy administration,

1596
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:58,292
so the kids weren't used to
those massive demonstrations.

1597
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,722
- You are so old!

1598
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:02,762
Wow, I didn't realize that...
Old man!

1599
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,626
- Shut up, Julian!

1600
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,995
- You are an old-
You are a geez- a geezer.

1601
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:08,930
- Okay, that's enough.
I think it's time for bed...

1602
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,395
What do you say, Julian?

1603
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,633
- OK, OK. I'm gonna go, guys.
I'm gonna-

1604
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,835
Gotta be up tomorrow.
- Au revoir.

1605
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,371
- OK.

1606
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,072
- I got the chair.

1607
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:26,015
- Please continue.
- Huh?

1608
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,713
- Your Berkeley-Kennedy
demonstrators. Please continue.

1609
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,949
This was, um,
before Patty Hearst

1610
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,821
and, uh,
the DNC in Chicago,

1611
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,325
It was before all that stuff.

1612
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:37,693
Every time I would try to pull
a demonstration together,

1613
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:41,199
it was, uh, just a disaster.

1614
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:46,406
Unless we had some fascist
on the campus that we could yell at,

1615
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:49,442
it would turn
into some gigantic sock hop.

1616
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:53,706
I'll explain that to you later.
I'll tell you what that means.

1617
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:58,342
But the point is, everybody came just
to be part of the scene, you know,

1618
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,511
just to-
just to be in the club.

1619
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:03,123
And then, one day I realized,

1620
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:05,191
it's never real

1621
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,726
until it stops being fun.

1622
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:10,763
All of these people,
everyone one of them

1623
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:13,025
has to be as serious
as you are about it.

1624
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:16,967
Not that it's realistic that
anybody would ever be as serious

1625
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,969
as you are about anything.

1626
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:25,140
That was a little joke, Leon.

1627
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:27,838
Marie calls them: "jokitations".

1628
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:30,946
Leon?

1629
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:33,878
Leon?

1630
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,214
- All right.
Here's the deal.

1631
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,755
We fucked that strike up.

1632
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:39,826
- It wasn't that bad.
- It wasn't awesome.

1633
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:41,087
- Well, we're moving on.

1634
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:42,230
But before we do,

1635
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,388
you all need to
ask yourselves one question:

1636
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,931
How far are you willing to go?

1637
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,228
- (Sarah): All the way.
- (Skip): Yeah.

1638
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,166
- Well, good.
Faith without deeds is dead.

1639
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:51,805
The time has come
for a coup.

1640
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:53,998
Everyone follow?
- Fuckin' A!

1641
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,642
- Remind me what a coup is again.

1642
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:57,744
- I can't go any further
without saying this:

1643
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,380
We are changing territories here.

1644
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:02,141
We are going from
the defensibly legal,

1645
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:04,683
to the indefensibly illegal.

1646
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:05,979
- Uh, what?

1647
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:09,180
- We could go to jail.
For real.

1648
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,949
That being said, Skip and Sarah,

1649
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,754
I need you guys at
the movie theatre on Friday.

1650
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,692
You need a solid alibi
hiding in plain sight.

1651
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:17,764
Meanwhile,
when you're in the theatre,

1652
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,264
start texting your friends.

1653
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:22,301
You start texting your friends.
Get them to text their friends.

1654
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:25,371
Send out the word that there's
something happening at school.

1655
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,405
- I don't know.
Texting in the theatre?

1656
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:29,873
- That's just not cool.
Why can't I really help?

1657
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,808
I'm already in so much trouble
with dad.

1658
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,845
What's the worst
that can happen now?

1659
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,710
- I heard the word "jail" again.

1660
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:39,376
Um, why don't I just
take Sarah to the movies?

1661
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:41,818
- No. No, you will not.
Skip will.

1662
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:44,151
This is the biggest favour
you can do me right now.

1663
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:47,420
- Well, um, Sarah, I heard
there's a new Zack Efron movie

1664
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,290
coming up this weekend?

1665
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,829
- And I think there's, um,

1666
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:53,729
there's a new Ken Loach retrospective
at the Cinémathèque.

1667
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,927
- Either way.
- Who were those kids

1668
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,072
in the Animal Farm outfits
at the dance?

1669
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,174
- Oh, I know one of them.
Her name is Mélanie.

1670
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,436
- Uh, her name is
actually Marie-Soleil.

1671
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:04,669
- Mmm.

1672
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,872
I've told you, I know every
French person's name.

1673
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:10,644
- Bring me those heads.

1674
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,810
(School bell ringing)

1675
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,422
- (Loudly): So you're ready
to go to the movies?

1676
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,387
- Oh my god! Stop yelling.
Yes, let's go.

1677
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:18,821
- (Whispering):
OK. Sorry.

1678
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:19,961
(Chuckles)

1679
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,760
(K'naan singing ABC's)

1680
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:29,801
(Man chuckling)

1681
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,431
Yeah

1682
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:33,938
Come

1683
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,236
Go go go go go go go

1684
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,242
Let's go

1685
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:41,241
Fire

1686
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:43,111
Bundle up
My whole style is so cold

1687
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:45,275
I glow like old guys
who go bald

1688
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:47,045
My flow got no front
in the vocal

1689
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,213
Your flow got no button
its so old

1690
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,120
I don't mean to sound
like a showboat

1691
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,055
But it's true my persona's
nojoke

1692
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:54,957
I stepped into
some kind of portal

1693
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,825
I'm legend
and sometimes I'm noble

1694
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,727
I'm from the most risky zone oh

1695
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,367
No place
is more shifty global

1696
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,196
More pistols
Russian revolvers

1697
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,201
We shootin'all that is normal

1698
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,533
But it ain't just
because we want to

1699
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,300
We ain't got nowhere
we can run to

1700
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:10,068
Somebody please press the undo

1701
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:12,679
They only teach us
the things that guns do

1702
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:14,405
They don't teach us the ABCs

1703
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:16,243
We play on the hard concrete

1704
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,352
All we got is life on the streets

1705
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,647
All we got is life on the streets

1706
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,222
They don't teach us the ABCs
We play on the hard concrete

1707
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,951
All we got is life on the streets

1708
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,391
All we got is life on the streets

1709
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,326
They don't teach us the ABCs

1710
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:31,965
We play on the hard concrete

1711
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,328
All we got is life on the streets

1712
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:35,662
(Music stops )

1713
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,236
- See me go over the counter?

1714
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:38,770
- Hello?

1715
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,840
You real
But my real is tenfold

1716
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:42,306
My rhythm make yours a rental

1717
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,377
Gangsta if at ease essential...

1718
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,980
- What in God's name
is going on here?

1719
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:49,844
- This, my friend, is a coup d'État.

1720
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:51,417
They don't teach us the ABCs

1721
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,952
We play on the hard concrete

1722
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:56,386
All we got is life on the streets

1723
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,355
All we got is life on the streets

1724
01:24:58,526 --> 01:24:59,959
They don't teach us the ABCs

1725
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:01,720
We play on the hard concrete

1726
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,727
All we got is life on the streets

1727
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:06,093
All we got is life on the streets

1728
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,734
Come...

1729
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:09,392
- OK, we're good.

1730
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:13,200
- Mr. Bronstein, I know
it's you in that pig mask.

1731
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:15,899
(Sighing)

1732
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:18,807
- It's time for you guys
to get the hell out of here.

1733
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:22,040
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's nobody left.

1734
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:23,707
We-we-we've secured the office.

1735
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:26,285
There's no other reason
for you to stick around

1736
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:27,921
- You have any idea
how long it took me

1737
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:29,989
to figure out how
to barricade these doors?

1738
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:32,991
- You sure you don't need us?
- No, I'm-I'm positive.

1739
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,822
No, what I need
you guys to do

1740
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,294
is go find Skip and Sarah
and spread the word, OK?

1741
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:39,956
I- I need a really big crowd
out front and quick.

1742
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,194
We really need that crowd.

1743
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,803
- Understood, comrade.

1744
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,234
- Yeah, man.

1745
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:46,873
- Spasibo.

1746
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:04,391
Allô, police?

1747
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:08,051
Excuse me,
but I've forgotten how to say

1748
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,493
" hostage negotiation"
in French.

1749
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,096
Ah, d'accord.
Merci beaucoup.

1750
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:18,697
I actually just got off
the phone with the cops

1751
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:21,000
just this second.
They're on their way down now.

1752
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,201
I told them that
I wasn't armed technically,

1753
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,209
but that I could still
do lots of damage.

1754
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,974
- Stop talking to the cops!
- I thought it was cool.

1755
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:30,014
- Don't say anything else
till I get there.

1756
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,015
(Sighing)

1757
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,557
- I'm re-enlisting.
Do I have a cell phone?

1758
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:39,852
- Hey, uh, it's Leon.

1759
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,792
Um, I've taken
my principal hostage

1760
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:45,159
so I'll probably be
on the news soon.

1761
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:48,359
So, if you miss me at all
you can see me there.

1762
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,026
And I still love you.

1763
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,797
That's it. Goodbye.

1764
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,406
(Beeps)

1765
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:54,940
- Hey, uh, it's Leon.

1766
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:57,270
Um, I've taken
my principal hostage

1767
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:59,436
so I'll probably be
on the news soon.

1768
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,875
No cops yet.

1769
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:10,685
I guess people don't actually
care what happens to you.

1770
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:15,318
- What exactly do you hope to
accomplish today, Mr. Bronstein?

1771
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:18,624
Because the almost
certain outcome of this

1772
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,768
is you going to prison.

1773
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:22,903
- Yeah, I think that
was pretty obvious by now.

1774
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:26,234
- Why are you deliberately
sabotaging your own life?

1775
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,170
- Hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

1776
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:35,044
I am not sabotaging my own life.

1777
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:36,183
How dare you?

1778
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:39,650
And if I was, it would be
for the sake of my ideals.

1779
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,254
- Oh, please!
Your ideals?

1780
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:44,255
You want to better the existence
of your fellow man?

1781
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:45,722
- Yes! Yes!
That's exactly it!

1782
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:48,862
- Let me tell you what I learned
after teaching public school.

1783
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,294
They don't want your help.
They don't want it better.

1784
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:52,831
They want the same shit.

1785
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,935
If they didn't,
this wouldn't be hard for you.

1786
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,570
- You wanna know what's hard?

1787
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:58,228
What's hard for people like me

1788
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:01,034
is the very existence
of people like you!

1789
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,268
- You make me sad, Mr. Bronstein.

1790
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:06,311
A revolutionary sans a revolution.

1791
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,278
You're a real Russian tragedy.

1792
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:09,746
- No, you are.

1793
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:13,011
You-you are that doctor
in Uncle Vanya.

1794
01:28:13,187 --> 01:28:15,018
Ineffectual and middle aged.

1795
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,714
My troops will mobilize,
just you wait.

1796
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:20,360
They will shed
the thick cloak of boredom

1797
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:22,621
that you have
forced them into.

1798
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,958
They will don their coats of arms

1799
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,693
and the-the tunic
of oppression that you wear

1800
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,063
will choke you, sir.

1801
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:33,999
- You couldn't have mixed
that metaphor anymore.

1802
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:36,643
- I make my point!

1803
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:39,371
- Bronstein... Bronstein...

1804
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:42,543
Isn't that the kid
from the factory this summer?

1805
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:44,184
Yeah, the hunger strike kid.

1806
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:47,920
And now, he's taken
his principal hostage.

1807
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:50,121
Serious shit disturber.

1808
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,283
I thought he was fucked up, but...

1809
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,690
He's significantly more fucked up
than I thought.

1810
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:56,096
Ah!

1811
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:58,826
- Hmm.

1812
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,530
(Sighing)

1813
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:03,966
- Yes.

1814
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:06,129
Pigs is here.

1815
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:08,275
- Crowds yet?

1816
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:11,708
Any wild gangs of rebellious youth?

1817
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:12,938
No?

1818
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:15,275
What a shame.

1819
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:18,044
Maybe they don't hate me
as much as you think they do.

1820
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:19,379
Hmm?

1821
01:29:19,554 --> 01:29:20,745
(Students chattering)

1822
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:22,981
- OK, look.
We have to mobilize, guys.

1823
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:25,990
OK, it's crucial that we
physically support this cause.

1824
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,720
- Yawn.
Am I right?

1825
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:29,885
- Shut up.

1826
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:32,760
- But why? We already physically
walked out of school.

1827
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:34,993
- Yeah.
- That kid kind of scares me.

1828
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:36,636
- What the fuck
is he doing anyway,

1829
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,999
holding Berkhoff hostage?
Shit, that's serious!

1830
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:40,697
- Yeah. Why not Davis?

1831
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,036
- What'll Leon do after
this revolution?

1832
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,771
He'll redistribute homework
so we all have equal amounts?

1833
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:48,040
- Can we have a student
secret-police force?

1834
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,707
- I wanna be the young Putin!
Right?

1835
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:51,909
- Ha, ha, ha.

1836
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:54,247
OK, look.
You guys are gonna have to

1837
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,219
take this a little more seriously.

1838
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,689
- What the fuck is there
to take seriously about this?

1839
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,693
I mean, ha, ha and everything,
but where's the potatoes?

1840
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:04,454
- Sorry, what the fuck?

1841
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:07,760
- What's the substance
to Leon's argument?

1842
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:09,368
- Yeah, I completely agree.

1843
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:12,404
- OK, look, I'm not like his
spokesperson or whatever...

1844
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,040
- Oh, thank God for that!

1845
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:15,732
- Um...

1846
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,434
The schools suck.

1847
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:18,772
- Yeah, yeah.

1848
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:20,436
- Yeah.

1849
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:22,014
- (Boy): Yes.

1850
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:23,309
- Obviously.

1851
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:26,578
- No, I mean, seriously,
the schools suck.

1852
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,745
- Duh!
- (All): Yes.

1853
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,982
- Right, right.
Um, should it suck?

1854
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,355
I mean, seriously, guys,

1855
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:38,863
should school suck?

1856
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:41,257
- No.

1857
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,404
- No. No, right?

1858
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:45,971
- So, if we all agree
that school sucks

1859
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,732
and that it shouldn't,

1860
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:50,104
then what's next, guys?
Hmm?

1861
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:53,042
- This is turning out
to be a great speech.

1862
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:54,943
- That's where Leon's coming from.

1863
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,981
'Cause he's the one-
He thinks...

1864
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,745
that what's next
is us getting involved.

1865
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:01,752
Because are we?

1866
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:03,652
Are we involved?
I'm not.

1867
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:07,124
Fuck no! I mean, I'm the fucking
treasurer of the Student Union.

1868
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,160
- (Dwight):
I got you that job, man.

1869
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,695
- SHUT UP!

1870
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:12,765
- So fine, right?
Whatever.

1871
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:14,265
There's no judgement.

1872
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:16,266
but I mean, for real,

1873
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:19,065
we don't do shit
to make that school better.

1874
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,801
So Leon thinks
that by forming this union,

1875
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,707
that it'll force us
to kind of all get involved

1876
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,872
and we will
make things better.

1877
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:32,713
OK, he thinks that things have
a better chance of improving

1878
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:35,481
if we improve them ourselves.

1879
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,983
- I mean, that's dead fucking on.

1880
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,991
- Yeah.
- Exactly! Exactly!

1881
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,130
That's the best possible explanation!

1882
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:44,730
- Wait though.

1883
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,924
Tony, do you-
do you think Leon's right?

1884
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:49,535
- Of course, he is.
- No.

1885
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:52,537
- OK, Dwight,
I wanna know what Tony thinks.

1886
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,140
- I don't know.
I have no fucking idea.

1887
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:04,649
But, um, you know who doesn't
believe in this union?

1888
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:06,116
Uh, you know who thinks,

1889
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:09,120
like, our opinions mean
less than nothing?

1890
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:12,216
Fucking Berkhoff.

1891
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:15,487
You know, I'll-I'll figure out
what I believe later.

1892
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:19,497
'cause right now, all I want
is for that asshole to be wrong.

1893
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,931
And that's
the only reason I need

1894
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:23,195
to follow Leon.

1895
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:26,465
I'll put my deeds before
my faith for the time being.

1896
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:28,905
- I don't even think-
- Shut the fuck up, Dwight!

1897
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:38,551
- (Whispering): Burn.

1898
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:42,381
(Beeping)

1899
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:45,719
- Hey!

1900
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:48,058
That was fucking awesome!

1901
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:49,560
- Yeah, I guess we'll see.

1902
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,391
- No, seriously, Tony, it was.

1903
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:04,336
- Yeah, still gay.

1904
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:05,911
- Aw, fuck!
I'm sorry.

1905
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,571
I'm just super caught up in
this shit right now, you know?

1906
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:09,738
(Both chuckling)

1907
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:11,282
- Glad you liked
Land and Freedom.

1908
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:13,044
- Totally. It's like
my new favourite movie.

1909
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,346
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1910
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:17,719
- Hey! Skip! Sarah!
- What happened?

1911
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,382
Why aren't you guys with Leon?

1912
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,857
- He wanted us to leave.

1913
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:23,724
We've been rabble-rousing,
trying to spread the word.

1914
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:25,365
(Siren)

1915
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:26,864
How's the crowd coming?

1916
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:29,434
- Put it this way:
my thumbs hurt.

1917
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,572
I'll tell you more on the way.
Let's go.

1918
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:34,207
- They need your demands.
These cops are getting bored.

1919
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,468
They're gonna bust in there
and arrest you.

1920
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:40,139
OK.
OK, I'll tell the chief.

1921
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:43,512
OK, this is what he wants.

1922
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:46,084
He wants the
school board commissioner

1923
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:48,118
to, uh, allow the kids
to unionize.

1924
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,621
And safe passage to Venezuela.

1925
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:56,027
That was a joke, the Venezuela.

1926
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:59,064
He, uh, he wants the
commissioner brought down here.

1927
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:01,224
That's all.
- Fine.

1928
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:03,336
I want you to know
that we're humouring him.

1929
01:34:03,504 --> 01:34:05,165
- Humouring me?

1930
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,606
Could we please just get
Archambault down here

1931
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:11,040
as quick as possible
so we can all go home?

1932
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,440
Thank you.

1933
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:15,174
Awesome.

1934
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:17,909
- Ah-ha!

1935
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:19,143
- This isn't over!

1936
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,778
- Oh, I think we both know
that it pretty much is.

1937
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,291
(Honking)

1938
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:31,993
- Mom!
What are you doing?

1939
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,224
- Get in the car, kids.

1940
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:34,299
- No, Ma.

1941
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:36,493
We're going to the school for Leon.

1942
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,138
And no, not even just for Leon.

1943
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:40,637
This is something
that we all believe in.

1944
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:43,333
I won't come home with you!
I'm sorry if I let you down.

1945
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,672
- Stop being so shrieky!
I'll drive you.

1946
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:47,677
- You will?

1947
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:49,213
- Yeah, come on!
Come in! Hurry!

1948
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:52,614
- Oh, great. I don't-
Do you guys want a ride?

1949
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:57,187
- Can you all fit in?

1950
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,290
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you OK?

1951
01:34:58,459 --> 01:34:59,551
Put your seatbelts on.

1952
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,695
Your father wanted
to come too,

1953
01:35:01,862 --> 01:35:03,921
but he had a meeting
with the Moroccans.

1954
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:05,565
- What's that?
Put the seatbelt on.

1955
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,496
- Mum! Drive the car.
- Oh, come on!

1956
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:12,139
(Sirens)

1957
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:23,015
- Madame, uh-

1958
01:35:23,184 --> 01:35:24,310
- Madam Chairman...

1959
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:26,586
- Madame...

1960
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,285
- Ma'am I should really explain
the circumstances...

1961
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:32,722
- I watch the news I know exactly
what's going on here.

1962
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:33,985
But thank you very much.

1963
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:36,552
Leon Bronstein
Please come to the window.

1964
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:39,027
Give me a hand.

1965
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:55,247
- Uh, welcome.

1966
01:35:58,152 --> 01:36:01,986
- I am thoroughly unimpressed
and unamused,

1967
01:36:02,156 --> 01:36:03,054
Monsieur Bronstein.

1968
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:06,159
Now, perhaps this is your idea
of playful hi jinks,

1969
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:07,487
but in my books

1970
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:10,186
and in the books of
the gentlemen in uniform here,

1971
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:14,232
this is an egregious
and punishable offence.

1972
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:17,268
- Well, maybe now you'll see
that we're actually serious.

1973
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:21,636
- Who is the "we",
Monsieur Bronstein?

1974
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:23,367
You and God?

1975
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:25,068
Are you the king of England?

1976
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:29,580
All I see is
one brilliant young man,

1977
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,184
desperate for attention,

1978
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:35,083
and clearly willing to go
all the way to get it.

1979
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:36,484
- Yeah, OK.
We want a union!

1980
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:37,988
- Listen, Norma Rae,

1981
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:39,888
we've already had that discussion,

1982
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,925
and it's not gonna happen.

1983
01:36:42,096 --> 01:36:44,894
So let your principal go.
- We want a union.

1984
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:47,659
- You don't deserve a union!
You're children.

1985
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:50,463
You do what we'll tell you to do.

1986
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:54,074
And on behalf of all adults,

1987
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:57,039
grow up, Monsieur Bronstein.

1988
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:58,109
- Madame Archambault!

1989
01:36:58,279 --> 01:37:01,077
Do you want him
to be an adult or not?

1990
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:03,375
- Did I not just make myself clear?
- No, you didn't.

1991
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:06,520
It seems like a very adult thing to do,
fighting for your rights.

1992
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:08,518
- Well, no one asked
for your opinion.

1993
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:10,384
- I, uh, agree with her.

1994
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:15,626
(Man on CB, indistinct)

1995
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:18,128
- There's a surprise.

1996
01:37:18,299 --> 01:37:19,766
Run out of clients, Frank?

1997
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:22,494
Had to start scouting
the high schools?

1998
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,503
And this is the best you could find?

1999
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,369
Leon Bronstein,
the shining beacon of hope

2000
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:30,305
for the great revolution?

2001
01:37:30,477 --> 01:37:32,035
- I think he may well be, yeah.

2002
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,472
- How profoundly disappointing.

2003
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:37,617
- Good god, Denise,
you're so mean!

2004
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:39,912
- Why don't you tell
your crazy, little friend

2005
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:41,486
to let us all go home?
OK, Frank?

2006
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:43,520
- Let me ask you one
real question first.

2007
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,090
- Shoot.

2008
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:48,387
- What kind of people you think
it takes to change the world?

2009
01:37:48,562 --> 01:37:49,995
I know it's all very amusing

2010
01:37:50,164 --> 01:37:52,928
for those of us in
the post-postmodern here,

2011
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,727
this notion of revolution.

2012
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:57,200
But what kind of people
do you think it takes

2013
01:37:57,371 --> 01:37:59,066
to really pull this thing off?

2014
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,832
Do you think
they ever change?

2015
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:02,032
No!

2016
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:04,541
They're always
the wrong men for the job.

2017
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:08,944
They're always the ones
other people think are crazy.

2018
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:10,606
- Do I really have to listen to this?

2019
01:38:10,784 --> 01:38:13,753
- Do I think Leon Bronstein
is the right man for the job?

2020
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,388
You bet your ass, Denise,

2021
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:18,389
because he's doing it
and you're not.

2022
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,151
- Bravo.

2023
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:22,727
- Can I park here?
- Yeah, you can park here.

2024
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:23,795
- OK.

2025
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:25,022
- Uh, what's that?

2026
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:26,461
- What's what?

2027
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,400
- Holy fuck!

2028
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,297
- By the way, Denise,

2029
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:03,766
that shining beacon of hope
found me.

2030
01:39:05,806 --> 01:39:07,740
And I'm damn grateful he did.

2031
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:09,398
- We want a union!

2032
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:11,635
We want a union!

2033
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:13,803
- We heard you, Monsieur Bronstein.

2034
01:39:41,742 --> 01:39:45,234
- Guess this is the "we"
you were talking about, Denise.

2035
01:39:45,412 --> 01:39:47,505
- We want a union!

2036
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:49,808
We want a union!

2037
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,918
- We want a union!

2038
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:54,316
- (Students):
We want a union!

2039
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:56,456
We want a union!

2040
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:58,056
We want a union!

2041
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:00,090
We want a union!

2042
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:01,852
We want a union!

2043
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:03,963
We want a union!

2044
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:06,156
We want a union!

2045
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,857
We want a union!

2046
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:10,833
(Inaudible )
We want a union!

2047
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,973
We want a union!
We want a union!

2048
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,335
We want a union!

2049
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:18,137
(Inaudible )
We want a union!

2050
01:40:18,312 --> 01:40:19,939
We want a union!

2051
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:22,014
We want a union!

2052
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:05,191
- I'm his lawyer
I go where he goes.

2053
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:06,417
(All shouting)

2054
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:20,363
(Crowd cheering)

2055
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:22,702
- (Muffled): Boredom!

2056
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:24,867
- (Students):
Union! Union! Union!

2057
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:27,741
Union! Union! Union!

2058
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,906
Union! Union! Union!

2059
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,882
Union! Union! Union!

2060
01:41:45,032 --> 01:41:46,795
(Cheering)

2061
01:41:56,076 --> 01:41:57,600
(Cheering)

2062
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:07,619
- Well, of course
we're gonna appeal,

2063
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:10,382
but we're very happy
the way things turned out.

2064
01:42:10,557 --> 01:42:13,651
- Yeah, uh, this is a message
to the youth of Canada-

2065
01:42:13,827 --> 01:42:16,625
uh, nay, to the youth
of the world,

2066
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,788
uh, that they may be able
to wound us,

2067
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:20,490
but we will never be silenced.

2068
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:21,725
We will always be heard!

2069
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:24,132
The revolution lives on!

2070
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:26,101
(Reporters shouting)
Vive la revolution!

2071
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:28,673
- All charges against Leon
Bronstein have been dropped.

2072
01:42:28,842 --> 01:42:30,969
The court released him
on one condition.:

2073
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:32,703
he is never allowed
to attend school

2074
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,541
in the province of Québec,
ever again.

2075
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:37,113
(Grunting)

2076
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:47,726
- Well, if you need anything,
money or food, just call me.

2077
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:49,863
I'll send you whatever you need.

2078
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:51,895
- Thank you.
- OK.

2079
01:42:52,065 --> 01:42:53,726
And, uh, don't worry about Ontario.

2080
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:56,529
You know, they're not only
Alice Munro and Maple Leaf fans.

2081
01:42:56,703 --> 01:42:58,034
There are fun people there too.

2082
01:42:58,205 --> 01:42:59,137
(Chuckling)

2083
01:42:59,306 --> 01:43:00,864
And, you know, your father
wanted to be here,

2084
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:03,032
but he couldn't because
he had a meeting with,

2085
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,802
you know,
those Arabic people and-

2086
01:43:04,978 --> 01:43:06,969
- It's OK, Mom.
- I love you.

2087
01:43:07,147 --> 01:43:08,341
- I love you too.

2088
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:10,483
I'm so proud of you.
You are amazing.

2089
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:11,709
- Oh, stop it.

2090
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:14,183
Have fun.
And let me know what you plot.

2091
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:17,790
- I will.
And, uh, give my regards to Skip.

2092
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,926
- Who's Skip?
That guy I saw you with?

2093
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:21,720
- Thanks, Leon.

2094
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:22,827
- Is he Jewish?
- Ma!

2095
01:43:22,996 --> 01:43:24,224
- Well, you know...

2096
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:26,662
- I know.
We're gonna honeymoon soon.

2097
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:28,824
I'm keeping my fingers crossed
for the Nunavut.

2098
01:43:29,002 --> 01:43:30,162
- Hey, you're lucky.

2099
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:31,804
You only have
to get banished

2100
01:43:31,972 --> 01:43:32,870
someplace arctic once.

2101
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,372
I have to do it all over again
with my second wife.

2102
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:37,476
- Oh my god!
What have I done?

2103
01:43:37,644 --> 01:43:38,736
Call me every day.

2104
01:43:38,912 --> 01:43:40,004
- I will.

2105
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:43,312
(Sighing)

2106
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,914
- Drive safely!

2107
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:51,822
- I shall return.

2108
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:02,830
(Engine sputtering)

2109
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:06,031
(Car approaching)

2110
01:44:10,944 --> 01:44:12,844
(Engine turning)

2111
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:20,011
(Engine stops)

2112
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:25,581
- Hello.
- Hey.

2113
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:28,722
Uh...

2114
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:31,125
Yeah, so...

2115
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:36,330
I, uh...

2116
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:40,805
Yeah.

2117
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:43,101
- Chairman Mao's Little Red Book.

2118
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,142
- Yeah, it's in Chinese.

2119
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,280
So hopefully,
you won't understand it.

2120
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,508
- Thank you, Dad.

2121
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:21,008
(Quacking)

2122
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:45,972
- Nadia!

2123
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:48,164
(Speaking Russian)

2124
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:49,707
- Nadia!

2125
01:45:49,876 --> 01:45:52,367
Give me a second, please.
Just one second!

2126
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:53,706
(Speaking Russian)

2127
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:55,313
I didn't even sleep with her!

2128
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:56,779
- That's best you can do?

2129
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:58,383
- Well, it's fucking early!

2130
01:45:58,552 --> 01:46:00,144
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

2131
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,252
- Look!

2132
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:02,888
Look at hotness
in front you.

2133
01:46:03,056 --> 01:46:04,114
- I know!

2134
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:07,124
- And you cheat on me with
stupid Ontario puck bunny!

2135
01:46:07,294 --> 01:46:08,693
- I-I didn't though.

2136
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:10,386
- You don't understand
my hotness?

2137
01:46:10,564 --> 01:46:12,122
No.

2138
01:46:12,299 --> 01:46:13,630
No, you understand nothing!

2139
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,893
Why don't you call me
when you figure out

2140
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:18,162
whatever fuck you want,
OK, Vladimir?

2141
01:46:18,338 --> 01:46:19,703
- Nadia.

2142
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:21,738
Nadia,
can you come back please?

2143
01:46:21,908 --> 01:46:24,342
Nadia?

2144
01:46:25,812 --> 01:46:27,837
(Whispering):
Fuck me. Fuck!

2145
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:31,006
(Choir singing in Russian)

2146
01:46:33,153 --> 01:46:34,848
What? What's up?

2147
01:46:35,021 --> 01:46:36,579
- Mr. Ulianov?

2148
01:46:36,757 --> 01:46:38,349
Mr. Vladimir Ulianov?

2149
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:40,288
- Only to my grandmother, pal.

2150
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:42,018
(Giggling)

2151
01:46:42,195 --> 01:46:43,822
Fuck! Is this about
that library book?

2152
01:46:43,997 --> 01:46:45,828
'Cause I brought it back, man.
I swear to God.

2153
01:46:45,999 --> 01:46:48,263
Maybe they can't find it there,
but I returned it.

2154
01:46:48,435 --> 01:46:52,735
I don't give a shit about the history
of the printing press, I swear to God.

2155
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:55,136
- I-I don't either.
I don't know anyone who does.

2156
01:46:55,308 --> 01:46:57,469
No, listen, listen.
Uh, no, Vladimir...

2157
01:46:59,212 --> 01:47:01,976
My name is Leon Bronstein.

2158
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:03,673
(Music stops )

2159
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:07,450
We have to talk.

2160
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:11,754
- What, now? Oh no, dude.
No, no, no.

2161
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:13,916
Oh, my girlfriend
just dumped me.

2162
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,026
I'm drunk.

2163
01:47:15,195 --> 01:47:16,753
This is not
a good time for me.

2164
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,761
- Listen, none of that
matters anymore.

2165
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:22,026
Please, allow me
to buy you a cup of coffee.

2166
01:47:24,237 --> 01:47:26,535
Please.

2167
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:30,966
May I put my arm on you?

2168
01:47:32,813 --> 01:47:36,078
You and I are going
to change the world.

2169
01:47:36,249 --> 01:47:39,184
- Cool, uh, stop touching me.

2170
01:47:39,352 --> 01:47:41,183
(Speaking Russian)

2171
01:47:44,825 --> 01:47:47,885
(Sebastian Grainger singing
Meet New Friends )

2172
01:47:48,328 --> 01:47:50,888
Make up your mind

2173
01:47:51,064 --> 01:47:55,023
And don't waste your time

2174
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:59,400
You've been so unkind

2175
01:47:59,573 --> 01:48:04,169
You've been so unkind

2176
01:48:05,445 --> 01:48:10,473
You know all of the words

2177
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:12,982
Feels good to

2178
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:19,115
Hold on

2179
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:27,524
Take time off
and get things done

2180
01:48:27,701 --> 01:48:31,535
Get out
Meet new friends

2181
01:48:31,705 --> 01:48:36,165

Get out get out

2183
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:18,844
Well, there's nothing
cool about it

2184
01:49:19,019 --> 01:49:23,149
If there ever was I doubt it

2185
01:49:23,323 --> 01:49:27,589
You should find pleasure
abounding

2186
01:49:27,761 --> 01:49:31,993
From the only place I found it

2187
01:49:32,165 --> 01:49:37,125
Take time off

2188
01:49:37,304 --> 01:49:41,866

We can see the future lately

2192
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:58,386
I've been lost
without you baby

2193
01:49:58,558 --> 01:50:02,619
Even when I'm talking
to someone

2194
01:50:02,796 --> 01:50:07,392
I am alone
I am alone

2195
01:50:59,552 --> 01:51:02,453
Make up your mind

2196
01:51:02,622 --> 01:51:07,059
And don't waste your time

2197
01:51:07,227 --> 01:51:11,425
You've been so unkind

2198
01:51:15,568 --> 01:51:18,765
Ooh

2199
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:25,166
