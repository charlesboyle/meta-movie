00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,569
Goddamn.

2
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,329
You OK?

3
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,089
The goddamn food
is making me sick.

4
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,849
You gonna be able to drive?

5
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,246
This fucker drives itself.

6
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,004
You think that's funny?

7
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,249
You think that's funny?!

8
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,006
Give me that hot dog.

9
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,369
- I'm just about to eat it.
- Give me that fucking hot dog.

10
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,125
Open.

11
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,719
What are you doing?

12
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,764
Open your fucking mouth.

13
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,679
- You're making me uncomfortable.
- Open it!

14
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,639
Open your fucking mouth.

15
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,999
Get that fucking thing in there.

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,044
Take it. All of it. That's it.

17
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,559
Fucking whore.

18
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,599
Everybody all right over here?

19
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,879
Hey, mind your business, pal.

20
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,879
Yeah, when you slap a woman around,

21
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,159
it is my business, pal.

22
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,399
Stay out of my shit, motherfucker.

23
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,204
That's Mr. Motherfucker to you.

24
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,919
- Harlan, come on. No, don't.
- Yeah, come on.

25
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,279
Harlan?

26
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,084
Harlan...

27
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,719
I don't want no trouble.

28
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,839
- Harlan!
- Yeah, you already started...

29
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,399
Harlan, stop!

30
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,079
Come on, don't! Stop!

31
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,479
Harlan!

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,999
Stop it! Stop!
Stop it!

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,959
Stop it!

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,759
The fuck out of there!

35
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,849
Fucking whore!

36
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,119
Yeah, you want a problem?

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,119
Huh?!

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,800

Hey, man, is this...

62
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,119
That was race eight
right there on TV two?

63
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,239
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

64
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,886
- You looking at it?
- Isn't that what I said?

65
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,170
Are you fucking kidding me?

66
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,679
Man, what are you doing here?

67
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,679
- What are you doing here?
- Huh?

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,319
What are you doing here?

69
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,488
You playing the ponies now?

70
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,279
Well, I don't know.
Just trying to make a little dough.

71
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,079
Son of a bitch.

72
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,039
What, man? Gonna give me some shit?

73
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,839
I ain't giving you shit.
I'm just wondering

74
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,439
where you're getting
the money to bet with.

75
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,719
- Borrowed it.
- Yeah?

76
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,251
Yeah.

77
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,729
Who from?

78
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,279
Huh?

79
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,559
- Who from?
- John Petty.

80
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,679
Motherfucker gave me a tip,
it didn't pay off.

81
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,079
Well, of course he did.

82
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,361
How much he loan you?

83
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,759
I don't even know.

84
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,239
You don't even know?
You know. How much?

85
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,204
How much?

86
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,283
Fifteen hundred.

87
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,039
Fuck me, Rodney.

88
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,159
Where you gonna get that money
to pay him back with, huh?

89
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,359
And what else you gonna owe him?

90
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,879
You got a check coming in
from somewhere or...?

91
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,159
- No.
- You know, 'cause I ain't

92
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,239
got that kind of cash
lying around to bail you out.

93
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,359
Well, I didn't ask for you to bail me out.
No. Don't fuck around with John Petty.

94
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,759
I'm not fucking around with him.

95
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,247
He gave me a fucking tip,
it didn't pay off.

96
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,081
Come on, man.
Don't give me this shit.

97
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,650
Hey, uh, tell Dad that, um...

98
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,399
I'll be by before work tomorrow.

99
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,879
All right.

100
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,519
And, you know, just...

101
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,763
Don't go.

102
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,802
If I could stay, I would.

103
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,245
Then stay.

104
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,319
Leaving you ain't easy, girl.

105
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,919
Or I'll stay.
I'll stay until you get back.

106
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,879
What time do you get off?

107
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,684
Working a double.

108
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,959
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

109
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,479
Russell, you work too much.

110
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,399
Got to bring home the bacon

111
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,399
to fatten you up.

112
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,159
You, you little Skinny Minnie.

113
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,199
My Skinny Minnie.

114
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,479
Skinny Minnie.

115
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,799
No, I want you to fatten
me up with a baby.

116
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,239
Want to run away somewhere?

117
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,851
Don't change the subject.

118
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,639
I want to run away somewhere.

119
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,839
Let's do it.

120
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,799
- Where?
- I don't know.

121
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,319
I've never been east
of Scranton, but...

122
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,482
- I'm gonna fatten you up.
- Stop.

123
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,999
Uncle Red.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,439
Hey, buddy, how are you?

125
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,479
Saw your truck.

126
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,199
Hey, Dad.

127
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,084
Hey, how you doing?

128
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,639
- OK.
- I'm here.

129
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,479
That's why I'm OK.

130
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,326
You're hot.

131
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,879
Your hand's so cold.

132
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,879
- That feel good?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,239
His fever?

134
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,441
Yeah, it's Still high.

135
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,039
Hey, you want to get a drink later?

136
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,322
Yeah. Where?

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,009
John Petty's?

138
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,359
- How's Lena?
- Oh, she's good.

139
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,199
Keeping me in check.

140
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,199
- Big job.
- Yeah.

141
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,039
You know?

142
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,479
Well, give her a hug for me.

143
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,759
You bet, dirty old bastard.

144
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,239
All right, Pops,
I got to go to work.

145
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,839
All right.

146
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,599
I'll see you later.

147
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,359
- You'll come back, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

148
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,369
I always come back.

149
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,759
- I love you.
- Me, too.

150
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,691
- Keep your hands warm.
- OK.

151
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,039
Hey, thanks for coming by.

152
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,844
See you, Russ.

153
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,919
<i>I have come here tonight</i>

154
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,439
<i>to stand with you,</i>

155
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,279
<i>to change America,</i>

156
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,279

157
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,879

160
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,719
I'm afraid we're about to
lose another Kennedy.

161
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,639
God bless him. You want another?

162
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,799
No, I'm good.

163
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,639
No, Rodney was supposed
to meet me here half hour ago.

164
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,319
Oh, yeah, how is old Rodney?

165
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,199
He seems awfully quiet
last few times he was here.

166
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,559
Yeah, he stop-lossed again.

167
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,919
- He's going back next month.
- Ahh...

168
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,519
Those poor sons of guns. They're
holding them against their will.

169
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,079
They're gonna run them into
the ground, they're not careful.

170
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,999
Don't get me started.

171
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,639
Well, if he turns up,

172
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,119
you tell him I headed
home to see Lena?

173
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,651
- Sure.
- All right.

174
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,039
Oh, hey, I got this one.

175
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,083
Whoa, thanks, Dan.

176
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,839
Is, uh... Is John in?

177
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,319
I just, you know,
need to bend his ear.

178
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,119
Uh, he had someone
back there earlier,

179
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,679
but, uh, I think they
might be gone.

180
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,008
- All right if I...
- Yeah.

181
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,599
If I have to come all the way
down here again, I swear to God,

182
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,199
I'll gut your fucking ass, cunt.

183
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,599
You hear me, Petty?

184
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,559
You better start following
through on your promises.

185
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,159
Oh, you know I can't control
some of those fuckers.

186
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,039
For 25 grand,
you'd better control them.

187
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,999
I ought to put a piece
of lead in your ass

188
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,359
- and take everything in here.
- John, you back here?

189
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,279
Oh, I'm sorry, should I
come back later or...?

190
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,881
No, it's OK. We're finishing up.

191
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,644
Your mama teach you
to barge in like that?

192
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,608
You got a problem with me?

193
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,121
I got a problem with everybody.

194
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,999
Who the fuck are they?

195
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,359
Inbred mountain folk from Jersey.

196
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,279
Church ain't over until
the snakes are back in the bag,

197
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,679
know what I mean?

198
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,239
What are they doing down here?

199
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,771
Don't ask.

200
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,799
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.

201
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,365
Take it.

202
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,491
What's up?

203
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,091
Oh, here.

204
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,199
It's from Rodney.

205
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,439
I know it's not nearly all there.

206
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,679
I hate that you work your ass off
to pay his debt.

207
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,159
Rodney needs to watch it.

208
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,330
I like him, Russell, I really do,
but I worry that...

209
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,399
Hell, he might be
safer over in Iraq.

210
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,479
Well, do you mind not
telling him I brought you that,

211
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,559
please, and if he don't
bring the rest of it,

212
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,240
I will on my next payday.

213
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,571
OK.

214
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,559
I won't say a thing.

215
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,728
All right, thanks.

216
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,719
<i>Cubs lead Pirates ten
to one in the bottom of the sixth.</i>

217
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,559
<i>Chavez off of first base.</i>

218
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,839
<i>Lilly's still looking strong
on the mound,</i>

219
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,725
<i>and Lilly delivers. Swinging,
there's a drive, deep...</i>

220
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,679
Hey.

221
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,245
Hey, there.

222
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,721
Can you...

223
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,199
Can you... Can you hear me?

224
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,559
Hey, there, little fella.

225
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,359
Hey, there.

226
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,449
Hey, there...

227
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,439
little fella.

228
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,119
Oh, God.

229
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,970
Oh, God.

230
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,119
Hey. Help.

231
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,483
Can you come help? Come...

232
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,439
You know, I just
keep my head down.

233
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,689
Studying shit I should've studied
in high school, you know?

234
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,479
- Could be worse.
- How could it be worse?

235
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,170
I don't know.

236
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,679
I could be going to Iraq with you.

237
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,564
No shit.

238
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,359
I asked Lena to come down here.

239
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,679
She said some bullshit about
not wanting to see you like this.

240
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,399
- You shouldn't have.
- Oh, fuck that.

241
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,679
She don't like this place.
What are you going to do?

242
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,879
She doesn't like this place?

243
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,599
What, is there someone
who likes this place?

244
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,599
Come on, just give her a break.

245
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,839
And what about you?
You still seeing the, uh...

246
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,599
uh, woof-woof?
Woof-woof! Down.

247
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,439
Oh, man, I almost forgot about her.

248
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,085
Thanks a lot.

249
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,690
How's, uh...

250
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,045
How's Dad doing?

251
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,879
- Uh, barely hanging on, really.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,679
Make sure you give him
a big hug from me.

253
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,239
You know?

254
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,719
Yeah, but...

255
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,039
You, uh, watch yourself over there.

256
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,159
OK.

257
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,399
- You, too.
- Yeah.

258
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,080
- Guess I know where to write to you.
- Yeah.

259
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,719
What's up, homey?

260
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,279
You fucking quiet.

261
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,642
You walk the yard,
you don't talk to nobody.

262
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,319
Are you a fucking faggot?
Huh, bro?

263
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,199
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You want to suck my dick?

264
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,401
Come here.

265
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,959
Fuck you!

266
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,279
Get him off me, you motherfucker!

267
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,163
Hey! Break it up!

268
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,239
Get off me, holmes!

269
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,959
Get upstairs!

270
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,119
- Get off me, <i>cabron!</i>
- Shut up!

271
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,519
He was trying to hang on
until you got out.

272
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,290
He wanted to see you.

273
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,169
It just ate him up.

274
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,959
You put him next to Mom?

275
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,525
Yeah.

276
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,884
Um... I'm glad you were home.

277
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,929
How was your last tour?

278
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,119
It was hard.

279
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,560
Yeah?

280
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,048
I mean, this...

281
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,519
You know, the whole thing...

282
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,649
Rodney, whatever you did...

283
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,650
whatever you did,
you had to do.

284
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,482
Yeah.

285
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,090
I got to go.

286
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,441
I love you, bud.

287
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,090
I love you, too, man.

288
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,719
<i>And surely,</i>

289
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,079
<i>he has borne our griefs</i>

290
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,799
<i>and carried our sorrows.</i>

291
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,439
Yet we will esteem him as stricken.

292
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,759
Smitten of God and afflicted.

293
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,599
But he was wounded
for our transgressions.

294
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,319
He was bruised for our iniquities.

295
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,039
The chastisement
of our peace was upon him.

296
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,131
And with his stripes,
we are healed.

297
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,359
Come here! Man!

298
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,879
Mmm.

299
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,650
How's it feel?

300
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,999
Eh, eh, eh.

301
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,839
Oh!

302
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,159
Look, I'm running, I'm gonna run.

303
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,039
- I'm running.
- Get away! Go!

304
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,199
- You driving?
- You want to drive?

305
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,719
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

306
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,046
Yeah?

307
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,848
Come on, motherfucker.
Say good-bye.

308
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,171
Hey, Jerry!

309
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,727
He didn't know who
the fuck you were.

310
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,560
Well, it is what it is.

311
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,969
I think you're better off.

312
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,243
Why would you say that?

313
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,359
Come on, man, she left you
without even telling you.

314
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,166
Now she's with fucking Wesley?

315
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,519
She's a smart woman.
Got her reasons.

316
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,210
You been hanging with, uh...

317
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,845
Billy and them lately?

318
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,799
- Nope.
- No?

319
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,479
What you been
doing with yourself?

320
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,599
- Looking for a job.
- Any luck?

321
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,529
- Nope.
- No?

322
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,724
On a liquid dinner?

323
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,639
It's the dinner of champions.

324
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,365
Yeah.

325
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,691
I'll be back.

326
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,889
Oh, Wesley, my lunch.

327
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,721
Bye.

328
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,645
Yeah!

329
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,769
Get your ass up, white boy!

330
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,239
Let's go!

331
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,039
Get your ass up, man!

332
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,651
Come on!

333
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,005
You ain't shit!
Look at you! Look at you!

334
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,684
Come on, motherfucker!

335
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,319
Come on, man, let's go!

336
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,799
This ain't fucking Iraq.

337
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,399
Let's go, soldier boy.

338
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,566
Get up!

339
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,520
Stop!

340
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,729
Break it up!

341
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,321
Smile, motherfucker!

342
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,369
That's bullshit!

343
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,879
Goddamn it, Rodney.

344
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,359
Did you not hear me?

345
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,519
Did you not hear me?

346
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,039
Motherfucker,
I took a hit in there.

347
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,919
I told you I can't really control
myself in the middle of a fight, man.

348
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,759
It's all a blur.

349
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,359
And don't fucking poke
on me again, either.

350
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,599
No more excuses.

351
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,319
No more Iraqi stories.

352
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,519
You just got to learn
how to take a fall

353
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,359
because you owe me
a lot of fucking money.

354
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,559
Well, I can't pay you back
your money by taking a dive

355
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,079
in this nickel and dime bullshit.

356
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,608
You'd better figure out something
and figure it out quick.

357
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,359
Yeah, let's go fight up in Jersey.

358
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,479
Up in the Ramapos they got fights.

359
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,519
Don't talk to me about that.

360
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,639
It's not for you.

361
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,239
Why? I heard they're big money.

362
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,599
Look, Rodney, go work in the mill.

363
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,519
Like your father and brother.

364
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,439
This isn't a way for you
to make a living.

365
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,768
You're a good kid
with a good heart.

366
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,159
You can do a lot worse

367
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,199
than living your life
like your brother, believe me.

368
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,879
I don't want to work
at the fucking mill, man.

369
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,599
I want to be just like you, John.

370
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,767
We'll talk later.

371
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,526
Hey.

372
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,966
Hi.

373
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,319
Where you been?

374
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,965
Out with the boys.

375
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,725
Well, looks like...

376
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,686
your boys play rough.

377
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,001
Want a drink?

378
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,801
No. The place looks nice.

379
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,810
Put it up!

380
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,605
Hey.

381
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,768
Let me see your hands.

382
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,686
What?

383
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,684
Let me see your hands.

384
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,007
Rodney, come here.

385
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,369
Let me see your fucking hands.

386
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,719
- Come on, man.
- Huh?

387
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,604
Don't give me no shit.

388
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,079
Is that the best you can do?

389
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,887
What do you think I should do?

390
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,241
I don't know.

391
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,519
Shovel asphalt for
the highway department.

392
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,006
Sell fucking shoes.

393
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,604
Come work at the mill.

394
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,559
Come work at the mill. I told you
Roach would give you a job.

395
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,445
No, man,
I'd rather be fucking dead.

396
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,411
Fuck the mill.

397
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,405
Fuck the mill.

398
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,399
I work at the mill,
you little fucker.

399
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,919
It's good enough for me.
It was good enough for our dad.

400
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,487
The fucking mill killed our dad!

401
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,719
Just don't be... Hey.

402
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,639
Just don't be too proud
to work for a living.

403
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,199
There's nothing wrong with it.

404
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,159
What'd you say?

405
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,799
Nothing wrong with
working for a living.

406
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,729
- Working for a living?
- Yeah.

407
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,603
What do you call this,
motherfucker?

408
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,919
Is that working for a living, huh?

409
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,559
Is it working for a living when
I carried my best friend's legs

410
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,639
under this arm, and the rest
of him under this arm?

411
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,839
I saw a fucking baby with
his fucking head cut off!

412
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,719
I saw a fucking pile of feet

413
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,239
in the middle of the street,
and I had to clean it up!

414
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,039
I gave my fucking life
for this country.

415
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,159
That's not work?

416
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,599
And what's it done for me, huh?

417
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,404
What's it fucking done for me?!

418
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,450
Fuck you.

419
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,999
Get me that fight up in Ramapo.

420
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,799
I told you not to
bring that up again.

421
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,399
I need one last
fucking fight, John.

422
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,959
Just give me one good fight, please.
One good fucking fight, please!

423
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,959
That's all I'm asking you.
Can you please do that for me?

424
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,519
No, you gotta trust
me when I tell you,

425
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,079
you don't want to set foot
in those mountains.

426
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,999
What is the big fucking deal?

427
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,599
The big fucking deal?

428
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,639
The big fucking deal is I've dealt
with these guys for a long time,

429
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,399
and when they don't get what
they want, they get nasty.

430
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,639
They get nasty, do they?

431
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,171
- Yeah. You don't know.
- Yeah?

432
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,239
Well, John, I don't really have

433
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,519
a lot of fucking options, man.

434
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,519
I can't fucking catch up
doing this small-town shit!

435
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,519
- Calm the fuck down.
- Come the fuck on, man!

436
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,319
- Come on, please! I'm sorry!
- I'm trying to protect you!

437
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,682
Just fucking call them up,
John. Please?

438
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,571
I'm not doing it, Rodney.
I'm not gonna call them.

439
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,999
Well, I'm not leaving until you do.

440
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,319
- Call them up.
- Rodney...

441
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,919
Just please call them up.

442
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,839
- John, please call them up.
- Rodney...

443
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,039
Please call them up.

444
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,919
I'm asking you for one fight.
Please call them up.

445
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,566
- Please call them up.
- Fuck, Rodney!

446
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,999
You fuck with these inbreds,
you'll come crawling back.

447
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,519
If you're lucky.

448
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,039
I don't really want
to be doing this.

449
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,039
This is not fucking around.

450
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,119
Let me talk to them.
Let me talk to them.

451
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,251
Yeah?

452
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,403
What the fuck you want, Petty?

453
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,279
<i>March, march,
where are my soldiers?</i>

454
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,479
<i>Where are my soldiers?</i>

455
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,286
No... uh-uh! Come on.

456
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,248
Hey!

457
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,079
We don't want
to wake up the neighbors.

458
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,440
You know what? Let's wake up
the neighbors. One, two, three!

459
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,759
So funny! Oh, my gosh!

460
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,680
Wait a minute!

461
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,359
OK, go, go, go, go, go!

462
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,843
- We're gonna play nice, right?
- Yeah!

463
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,359
What do you want?
You want to race me?

464
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,399
What do you want? What do you want?

465
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,599
- Racer? Huh?
- I want to go on the horsey.

466
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,799
- Where are the horsies? Huh?
- Over there. Over there.

467
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,846
- Race you over there.
- Yeah.

468
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,402
Lily... Lily, can you just
watch them for one second?

469
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,359
- You're staying at your dad's?
- Yeah.

470
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,451
You know, I'm trying
to give it some life.

471
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,439
I went to his funeral.

472
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,880
I know.

473
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,079
Thank you. That was...
important to me.

474
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,566
Thank you.

475
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,439
Are you back at the mill?

476
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,325
Just can't get enough of it,
you know?

477
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,125
I hear they're gonna close it.

478
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,559
Yeah, looks like it.

479
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,967
You know, cheaper to...

480
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,519
uh, get steel from China.

481
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,799
God, I've missed you so much.

482
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,446
I've missed you so much.

483
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,126
I was hoping that, uh...

484
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,119
we could work it out.

485
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,479
You know?

486
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,446
The things that were
keeping us apart and...

487
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,639
you know, take that
next step is something

488
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,127
I want to do with you.

489
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,008
Because, uh...

490
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,088
I can't be without you, Lena.

491
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,371
I can't.

492
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,803
I'm pregnant.

493
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,126
OK.

494
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,006
Wow.

495
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,165
Wow.

496
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,959
You, uh...

497
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,645
That's, uh...

498
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,923
That's wonderful news.

499
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,365
It is?

500
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,679
Yeah. That's wonderful news.

501
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,565
I'm real happy for you, Lena.

502
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,959
I really am.

503
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,759
That's wonderful news.

504
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,679
You're gonna be a hell of a mom.

505
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,486
Wow!
You're gonna be a hell of a mom!

506
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,885
I'm so sorry.

507
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,408
- I have to go.
- Yeah.

508
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,891
<i>OK.</i>

509
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,999
Hey, man!
What about it?

510
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,441
Goddamn, Uncle Red.

511
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,839
- Look like they fed you pretty good.
- Yeah.

512
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,759
You're fit as a racehorse.

513
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,039
How you doing?

514
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,279
Still this side
of the grass, you know.

515
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,926
Hey, I got something
for your daddy.

516
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,319
I had a feeling that was you.

517
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,679
- You're still raising them?
- Isn't that pretty? Yeah.

518
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,719
Yeah, when the weather permits.

519
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,439
Say, do you want to come over
to the cemetery with me?

520
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,559
Shit, yeah.

521
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,239
Rodney here?
Does he want to come?

522
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,851
Ah, I don't know where he is.

523
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,159
Let me get this shit inside...

524
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,359
run over with you.
- Hey, grab your rifle.

525
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,839
Maybe we can get
a shot off before dark.

526
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,479
I saw a real nice eight-point
out there the other night.

527
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,879
Yup. See if I'm still a
better shot than you.

528
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,639
Well...

529
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,968
let's go get us a buck, huh?

530
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,119
We can circle around these.

531
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,243
Seen a feral cat.

532
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,564
DeGroat?

533
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,359
I didn't drive five
and a half hours

534
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,599
to watch you play fucking cards.

535
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,959
Well, when you owe as much
as you owe me, Petty...

536
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,562
I guess I'm the last
person you want to see.

537
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,919
Step into the room, fighter man.

538
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,360
Let me get a good look at you.

539
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,159
- And what's your name?
- Rodney.

540
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,727
Is that it?
Just Rodney?

541
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,326
Rodney Baze.

542
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,890
Rodney Baze.

543
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,679
Well...

544
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,281
Rodney Baze...

545
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,087
I hear you're quite
the crazy fucker in the ring.

546
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,886
Makes me want
to jump in there with you...

547
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,368
and see who walks out.

548
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,242
We're standing so close,
I guess we could do it right now.

549
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,239
You gonna be a good boy
and take a dive,

550
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,204
like Petty said you would?

551
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,759
Or am I gonna have to
teach you a lesson?

552
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,399
No, he's good. He's good.

553
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,080
- Teach me a lesson?
- I gave you our word.

554
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:25,284
Yeah, teach you a lesson.

555
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,409
Everything's good.

556
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,409
Let me hear you say it.

557
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,486
Teach me a lesson?

558
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,719
Yeah, isn't that
what we talked about?

559
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,759
- Is this boy deaf?
- No, no, it's...

560
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,799
You been hit too many times?

561
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,651
Listen, we talked,
everything's good.

562
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,919
Hey, yeah.

563
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,759
I like this one.

564
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,246
He's tough.

565
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,159
- And angry.
- Plenty tough.

566
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,203
Four-tours-in-Iraq tough.

567
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,479
Now, why the hell you want
to come up here and fight,

568
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,199
or, hell, anywhere,

569
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,919
when you've been fighting
over there for so long?

570
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,361
I just need the money, man.

571
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,719
Mmm... Yeah.

572
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,402
Well... we all need money...

573
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,891
don't we, Petty?

574
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,799
So...

575
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,439
why don't me and John
discuss this deal

576
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,325
while you go put
your fight face on.

577
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,486
Didn't we just discuss the deal?

578
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,601
What, you think I was asking?

579
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,161
Hey! Don't! Keep your
fucking hands off him.

580
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,920
Just checking his reflexes.

581
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,119
You step out. Step out and we'll...

582
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,369
I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.

583
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,199
I should've popped
that motherfucker.

584
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,759
Well, that would be the last
motherfucker you ever popped.

585
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,319
Am I supposed to be scared of him
'cause he sucks on a lollipop?

586
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,879
Look at me.

587
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,719
You gotta make this look good.

588
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,719
You can't embarrass DeGroat

589
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,799
in front of these guys
that he's got coming up.

590
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,286
Well...

591
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,479
I can't promise to go down
for that motherfucker.

592
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,999
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?!

593
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,359
- Yeah. I heard you.
- Good.

594
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,039
Now get your shit
and let's get going.

595
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,765
Come on, get ready.

596
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,446
Showtime.

597
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,167
You ain't fighting with
that shit on, are you?

598
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,683
It's bare-knuckle up here.

599
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,522
Take 'em off.

600
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,439
Be careful out there.

601
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,599
Keep it going for a little while

602
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,326
and then you know what to do.

603
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,439
Look at that beauty.
Clean shot?

604
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,719
Yeah, right in the heart.

605
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,279
Inch either way, we'd be tracking
the son of a bitch all night,

606
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,879
like the last time, you remember?

607
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,479
- Yeah.
- You see anything?

608
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,039
Not a goddamn thing.

609
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,242
Come on, help me.
Give me a hand with this.

610
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,241
Aah!

611
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,359
Get him! Come on!

612
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,686
Come on, sucker...

613
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,839
Get off me.

614
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,724
Get up! Get up!

615
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,159
Rodney!

616
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,479
Rodney!

617
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,119
- Kick his ass!
- Come on, man!

618
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,731
- Just kick his ass!
- Rodney!

619
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,481
Rodney!

620
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,079
Come on, fucker. Get up.

621
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,599
Get up, motherfucker. You hear me?

622
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,928
You gotta hit me, make it look real.
Make it look real.

623
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,639
That's it! That's it!

624
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,199
He's done! He's done!

625
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,123
I made him stop!

626
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,319
Are you OK?

627
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,284
Hey, you OK?

628
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,484
You done good.

629
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,599
Look at me.

630
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,211
Bud.

631
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,279
Oh, Christ. You OK?

632
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,439
- Bud, you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah.

633
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,799
Impressive stuff.

634
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,651
All heart and fist.

635
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,119
That boy don't look so good.

636
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,399
Hey, hey, uh, don't...

637
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,479
Don't blow your nose,
your eyes will...

638
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,682
swell up.

639
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,729
Hell, mercy, you took a whooping.

640
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,529
You looked angry out there.
I thought maybe...

641
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,041
for a second you
weren't a good listener.

642
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,199
I was just reacting.
I just lost it a little bit.

643
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,039
Oh, yeah, well, hell,
I don't blame you.

644
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,839
I'd done the same thing,

645
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,520
guy pounded on me like that.

646
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,809
- Yeah.
- So our slate is clean.

647
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,881
Mmm...

648
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,611
Well, yes, as long as you
brought me the rest of my money.

649
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,719
Don't tell me you come all this way
and didn't bring me what you owe.

650
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,402
This was it. Now we're even.

651
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,690
That was the deal.

652
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,439
Oh. I must've got confused.

653
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,041
Whatever.

654
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,441
You need this?

655
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,448
Here. Wipe your face.

656
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,279
Last time I'm coming up here,
I can tell you that.

657
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,279
Sorry as hell you had
to go through that, Rodney.

658
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,639
It's not your fault.

659
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,959
I asked you to take me up here.

660
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,919
It's both of our faults.

661
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,879
But we're through with
those Ramapo fuckers.

662
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,639
That crazy son of a bitch
can kiss my ass

663
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,959
if he thinks I'm doing
business with him again.

664
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,288
Strung out fucking tweaker.

665
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,610
Oh, what the fuck?

666
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,363
What the fuck is this?

667
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,646
OK.

668
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,967
OK. OK. OK. OK.

669
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,485
What's the game?

670
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,370
Yeah?

671
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,599
I think your left rear's gone down.

672
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,006
What?

673
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,006
I said...

674
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,847
I think your left rear's gone down.

675
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,759
What shit you talking?

676
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,328
I ain't talking shit.

677
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,199
And our slate ain't clean,
motherfucker.

678
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,166
Get that other one out.

679
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,399
Let's go. Go get him.

680
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,119
Get the fuck out. Come on.

681
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,606
Get your fucking ass...

682
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,646
<i>"Russ...</i>

683
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,639
<i>I'm sorry about the other day.</i>

684
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,879
<i>I know you're looking out for me.</i>

685
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,679
<i>But you gotta understand
that I'm different</i>

686
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,882
<i>than I was before I left.</i>

687
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,719
<i>And I think that I always will be.</i>

688
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,571
<i>I can't explain how exactly.</i>

689
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,879
<i>My head is just full of stuff
and I can't get it out."</i>

690
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,719
Oh, man.

691
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,562
You should have kept
better company.

692
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,766
Don't look at me.

693
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,205
Look away.

694
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,930
Fuck you.

695
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,239
Oh, fuck you.

696
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,727
You fucking coward.

697
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,839
I don't care. I don't care.

698
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,683
Get some shovels.

699
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,759
<i>"But I'm gonna
turn things around.</i>

700
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,965
<i>I'm gonna do this one last fight
and then I'll be done.</i>

701
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,999
<i>Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt
or dig for coal</i>

702
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,599
<i>or I'll work with you
and Roach at the mill.</i>

703
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,759
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

704
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,599
<i>I'm gonna get things back on track.</i>

705
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,165
<i>I promise.</i>

706
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,319
<i>I love you, man.</i>

707
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,648
<i>I'll see you tomorrow
when I get back."</i>

708
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,570
Morning, Russell.

709
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,370
Glad you're home.

710
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,685
Thanks.

711
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,806
I guess you, uh...

712
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,364
heard that, uh...

713
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,522
I stopped by to see Lena.

714
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,005
Yeah, I'm aware.

715
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,451
Not why I'm here.

716
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,959
<i>I said...</i>

717
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,243
<i>I think your left rear's gone down.</i>

718
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,119
<i>What shit you talking?</i>

719
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,971
<i>I ain't talking shit.</i>

720
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,919
<i>And our slate ain't clean,
motherfucker.</i>

721
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,959
- Turn it off.
<i>- Get that other one out.</i>

722
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,764
We don't need to hear it again.

723
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:03,766
I've spoken to Jersey State,
Bergen County, Fish and Game.

724
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,559
All of them have dealt with this
Harlan DeGroat before.

725
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,839
The problem is that
the people up in those hills,

726
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,399
they don't cooperate.

727
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,879
Getting information from these
people is like pulling teeth.

728
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,519
It's a whole 'nother
world up in there.

729
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,919
Generations upon
generations of these people

730
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,839
never even come down
off that mountain.

731
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,079
Got their own breed of justice
and it does not include us.

732
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,559
Even the local police
sent in several squad cars,

733
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,919
but they haven't been able
to get nothing yet.

734
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,279
So you know that I'm stuck here
with my hands tied.

735
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,639
What the fuck does that mean?

736
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,047
That they aren't gonna...

737
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,759
do anything about this
or look for Rodney?

738
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,319
I did not say that, Russell.

739
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,959
I said that they're having
a difficult time

740
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,599
and I'm having jurisdiction issues.

741
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,599
But I'm gonna be
on it until it's done.

742
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,799
What the fuck?

743
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,128
- Bud.
- I mean, you know...

744
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,279
We know John Petty's dead.

745
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,159
I mean, Jesus, you know,

746
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,251
damn near hear him dying
on Dan's phone.

747
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,731
But Rodney might
still be out there.

748
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,279
I know that this is very hard

749
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,847
for you, but...

750
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,479
I do have a procedure
that I have to follow.

751
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,559
It sounds like there's
no procedure at all.

752
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,719
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.

753
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,159
It sounds like they're not
doing a goddamn thing.

754
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,649
Now, either you're all
afraid to go in there...

755
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,959
or, uh...

756
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,839
you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.

757
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,599
I said I'm into it,
and I said I'll handle it.

758
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,959
Don't make this personal.

759
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,679
- You need to stay out of my business.
- Stay out of your business.

760
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,999
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.

761
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,159
You know what?
While I was away, it seems that

762
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,959
all that you was into
was my business.

763
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,519
So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.

764
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,279
Yeah, I got a problem with you.

765
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,799
I'm not the one who was out
drinking and driving.

766
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,719
Got locked up and had
to leave his woman alone

767
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,730
'cause of something I did,
a mistake I made.

768
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,679
And I don't know nothing
about what happened to Rodney.

769
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:20,519
Nothing at all. I'm just
trying to do my job.

770
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,203
And I'm giving you my word that
I'm gonna be on it until it's done.

771
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,999
Until it's done.

772
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,771
Mmm. Well.

773
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,127
Russell. Come on.

774
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,885
What is it?

775
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,410
You want me to show you out?

776
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,250
I'll be around.

777
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,286
Dan.

778
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,128
- Where you going now?
- No, it's good.

779
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,839
- Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
- Hey.

780
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,919
I know how tough this is,
but I'm here to help anyway I can.

781
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,599
Then get me an address for DeGroat.

782
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,799
An address? How am I
gonna get that address?

783
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,399
Don't give me that shit, Dan. You know
as well as I do that John Petty has one.

784
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,119
Well, I don't...
I don't know.

785
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,639
Look, I'll see if I
can dig that up.

786
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,320
No, no, no, don't see
if you can dig it up.

787
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,759
- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.

788
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,759
If you're smart,
you let these boys handle it.

789
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,329
I know these guys. This DeGroat
is a nasty son of a bitch.

790
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,289
You let me worry about...

791
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,687
who's a nasty son of a bitch.

792
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,399
We'll follow you.

793
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,479
Damn, looks like John still owes
money to these people.

794
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,479
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal,

795
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,439
but I didn't realize
it was this big.

796
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,439
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal

797
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,319
up and down the Appalachians.

798
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,839
I don't know that much about it,
but my guess is,

799
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,479
Rodney went up there to fight.

800
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,319
Well, why didn't you just
say something to Wesley?

801
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,599
Well, I don't... I don't know.

802
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,239
I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.

803
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,799
John should've known better.

804
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,679
I think he did, Red,
but Rodney forced his hand.

805
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,928
He thought it was the only way
to pay off that debt.

806
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,719
I don't see DeGroat's address, but
I do know it's up in the Ramapos.

807
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,999
And, Russell, please
hear me when I tell you,

808
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,519
you'd be way better off letting
the authorities deal with him.

809
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,639
They're not doing
such a good job, Dan.

810
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,319
Well, I hear you,
but John hated dealing with them.

811
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,119
I'm surprised they haven't come
down here to get their money.

812
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,519
Money and drugs,
that's the only thing

813
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,882
that drove that crazy
son of a bitch.

814
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,209
Are you ready for this?

815
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,366
I guess so.

816
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,642
You watch your ass.

817
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,799
Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.

818
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,128
'66 or '67?

819
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,959
Man, you don't see
that Bolero red much.

820
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,479
You got the tuxedo black

821
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,639
and ash gold everywhere, but...

822
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,524
Yeah, this is sweet.

823
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,603
Three-ninety-six big block?

824
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,319
Yep.

825
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,079
That's a true 138 SS
right there, man.

826
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,479
Fucking rocket ship.

827
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,999
Well, I don't doubt it with
that Muncie four speed.

828
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,399
Hmm!

829
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,719
How long to restore it?

830
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,999
A couple years.

831
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,519
A couple years? Worth it.

832
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,279
You got nitrous?

833
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,359
Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.

834
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,999
Yeah.

835
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,884
You know who's got any candy here?

836
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,879
- What do you mean, "candy?"
- You know what I mean.

837
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,525
Yeah.

838
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,881
You a fucking cop?

839
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,119
Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?

840
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,319
Who's the old man in the truck?

841
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,727
Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.

842
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,959
- What you looking for, man?
- Whatever you got. You know...

843
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,559
Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies,
crystals or pure.

844
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,411
- It don't matter.
- Wow, he knows his shit.

845
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,679
Yeah, we got some buzzard dust,
some critty up at the house.

846
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,039
All right.

847
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,799
We'll get you feelin' shitty,
my friend.

848
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,048
Good. All right, I'll follow you?

849
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,884
Yo, it's Tiny.

850
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,679
- You wait right here, all right?
- All right.

851
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,120
All right.

852
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,965
Brought them boys out here
looking for some of the train.

853
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,483
Yo, if they got their
greenbacks, that's fine.

854
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,603
Come on up.

855
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,639
Who the fuck are you?

856
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,559
I'm just passing through.

857
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,570
I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.

858
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,039
Well, I didn't ask who you were.

859
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,528
We just want to get high,
and our money's green.

860
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,279
Well, then you come
to the right place.

861
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,639
But I got to say, you got
some balls coming up in here,

862
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,888
not knowing nobody.

863
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,769
But if your money's green...

864
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,519
then it's all good.

865
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,404
That's pure glass.

866
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,569
Fire it up.

867
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,119
Looks good to me. How much?

868
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,049
Nah, fire that shit up.

869
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,850
It'll blow your balls off, brother.

870
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,926
I told you, I'm good. How much?

871
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,124
You don't know, um...

872
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,490
Harlan DeGroat, do you?

873
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,639
Is that a joke?

874
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,079
Why would I joke about that?

875
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,009
'Cause this is his house.

876
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,919
He around?

877
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,930
I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.

878
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,246
All right.

879
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,919
Hey, Red.

880
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,202
Not now. We'll come by later.

881
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,644
Yo!

882
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,566
You forgot this.

883
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,921
Oh, Shit.

884
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,568
Put your hands where
I can see 'em, gentlemen.

885
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,570
Russell Baze?

886
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,839
That's right.

887
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,079
Chief Barnes from
the North Braddock Police

888
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,282
alerted us early this evening
that you were up here.

889
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,119
You're lucky I got here when I did.

890
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,719
If the locals knew
why you were here,

891
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,400
they'd zip you up and you'd
be leaving in a body bag.

892
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,799
Do I need to ask if you're
carrying concealed weapons?

893
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,525
No, sir.

894
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,799
- No, sir.
- All right.

895
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,279
Then, given that you're an ex-con,

896
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,767
likely carrying concealed weapons,
you have a choice.

897
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:03,002
Either I arrest you now or
I follow you to the state line.

898
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,559
With respect, officer,
my brother might be up here,

899
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,603
and I ain't leaving without him.

900
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,171
I'll only do Chief
Barnes a favor once.

901
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,999
You return and I'll
arrest you on the spot.

902
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,919
There's nothing you can do
from inside a jail cell.

903
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,079
Am I making myself clear,
gentlemen?

904
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,519
Yes, sir, you are.

905
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,087
All right.
Then I'll follow you out.

906
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,959
That boy was always troubled.

907
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,319
Ever since he was a little kid.

908
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,761
You could see it in his eyes.

909
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,447
Especially after your mama died.

910
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,039
Hey, Russell.

911
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,208
Wesley.

912
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,805
I just heard
from the Jersey police.

913
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,242
They found your brother.

914
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,885
He's dead.

915
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,410
OK.

916
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,442
A hunter's dog dug him up.

917
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,679
Sorry.

918
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,039
They just called me.

919
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,239
The coroner's gonna
examine his body.

920
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,011
I suspect that you'll have
him back by the weekend.

921
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,962
Place is really hard to locate.

922
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:18,807
The roads are all mostly trails.

923
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:33,759
- Let me go talk to him.
- No, no, no. I got it.

924
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,599
- It's OK.
- Yeah?

925
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,639
You hardly touched your food.

926
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,171
I ate enough.

927
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,999
I appreciate you coming over.

928
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,043
- I wanted to.
- Mmm.

929
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,965
We wanted to.

930
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,688
I'm sorry about Rodney.

931
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,685
I'm really sorry.

932
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,845
He was put through a lot, you know?

933
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,004
And so have you.

934
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,319
But please don't do anything.

935
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,885
OK?

936
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,759
You already tried.

937
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,999
You're lucky you
got out of there alive.

938
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,439
Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.

939
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,563
He's a good man, Russell.

940
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,879
- You want me to take it?
- No, I got it.

941
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,320
OK.

942
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,324
We may not have the...

943
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,202
the fire and the flame...

944
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,399
but we got something good.

945
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,090
You know?

946
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,483
Can we put this behind us?

947
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,205
Yeah.

948
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,245
Yeah.

949
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,125
- Thanks for dinner.
- Mm-hmm.

950
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,080
You ready?

951
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,285
Let's go.

952
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,599
Police!
On the ground!

953
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,087
Harlan DeGroat! Police!
Get down on the ground!

954
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,801
Get down!

955
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,363
The guy was expecting us.

956
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,399
Ooh, yeah!

957
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,524
Yeah! Yeah!

958
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,046
OK.

959
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,881
Every time, it's just...

960
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,559
<i>Forgive me my sins, O Lord.</i>

961
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,959
<i>Forgive me my sins.</i>

962
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,119
The sins of my youth...

963
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,642
the sins of my age,
the sins of my soul...

964
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,519
the sins of my body.

965
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,359
My idle sins...

966
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,359
my serious voluntary sins...

967
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,839
the sins I know, the sins
we have concealed for so long...

968
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,805
<i>which are now
hidden from my memory.</i>

969
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:33,925
<i>My Jesus, forget and forgive
what we have been.</i>

970
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,411
<i>Amen.</i>

971
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,559
Hey! Hey, Baze!

972
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,489
Russell! Come back!

973
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,239
Russell!

974
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:01,319
What are you doing here, man?
You can't be back here.

975
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,559
Wesley told me not to
let anybody back here.

976
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,559
- Give it up, please.
- Dan, where's that ledger?

977
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,000
Huh?

978
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,719
You can't be here.

979
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,399
Where's that ledger, Dan?

980
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,199
Russell, don't do this.
Let him handle it.

981
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,562
- This it?
- Russell, don't.

982
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:27,161
- You can stay if you want.
- I don't want any part of it.

983
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,771
<i>What?</i>

984
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,799
Harlan DeGroat?

985
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,479
Who wants to know?

986
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,119
<i>I've taken over
John Petty's accounts.</i>

987
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,687
- Who's this?
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

988
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,599
<i>I'm willing to settle his debt.</i>

989
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,041
<i>And we can keep this deal going.</i>

990
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,639
Who the fuck is this?

991
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,888
It don't matter.

992
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,449
You come to Braddock...

993
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,970
the money's yours.

994
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,967
How the fuck did you get my number?

995
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,849
<i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

996
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,009
Hey, we're closed.

997
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,724
Uh...

998
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:21,039
Why don't you get your fat
fucking ass in the kitchen,

999
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,368
fix me up a salmon burger?

1000
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,526
See what that bitch
has in the register.

1001
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:42,964
What do you say, Dan?

1002
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,039
- You look fit.
- Well, thanks.

1003
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,479
- Staying out of trouble?
- Yeah, trying.

1004
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,523
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1005
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,119
Yeah.

1006
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,519
So, uh...

1007
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,919
I hear you might have
some money for me.

1008
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,399
Who, me?

1009
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,999
You, somebody.

1010
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,879
No, not me. No.

1011
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:25,079
Well, do you know where
Petty keeps his money?

1012
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,879
Uh, no... Petty, you know, he...

1013
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:32,119
he keeps everybody at arm's length.
I just tend bar.

1014
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:35,199
Well, you just tend bar
from all the way back here?

1015
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,607
- Well, I'm just...
- That's a good trick, Dan.

1016
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,799
So let me get this straight.
You don't know where that money is?

1017
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,359
I don't know,
honest to God, I don't.

1018
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:49,559
I swear to God, I don't know.

1019
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,599
- You swear to God?
- Yeah.

1020
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,159
Well, if you're invoking
a deity over this,

1021
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,759
I guess I'm mistaken.

1022
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,086
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

1023
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,559
A long way to drive, Dan.

1024
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,039
Shoot

1025
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:16,199
- I didn't come five hours...
- I don't know!

1026
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,643
to not get my fucking money!

1027
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,439
Show me where that safe is.

1028
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,719
OK, OK!

1029
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,490
OK, I'll do it.

1030
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,962
OK, all right.

1031
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,599
Get that fucker open right now.

1032
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,279
Wait, I gotta remember
the combination.

1033
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:38,359
- Julie, call 911.
- Wait a sec, I'm trying.

1034
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,279
- I just need another number...
- Three.

1035
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,799
- ...one more number, wait...
- Two.

1036
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,799
Just give me a second so
I can remember the numbers!

1037
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,959
- Time's up, Dan.
- Wait!

1038
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,439
- Open it!
- Wait! One more number.

1039
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,639
Oh, God, thank God.

1040
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,569
It's empty.

1041
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,479
You kidding me?

1042
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,159
Where's my fucking money?
Motherfuckers!

1043
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:59,120
No!

1044
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:08,480
Dan! Oh, God, Dan.

1045
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,599
<i>Got a 216, shots fired.</i>

1046
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:12,326
<i>No suspect information at this time.</i>

1047
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,919
You know who I am?

1048
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,646
Get up.

1049
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,840
Get up.

1050
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,211
Keep going.

1051
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,328
I'm Rodney Baze's brother.

1052
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,650
Yeah.

1053
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,050
Tough kid.

1054
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,204
You hear those birds?

1055
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,284
Don't do it, Russell!

1056
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,480
Russell!

1057
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,450
Drop your weapon!

1058
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,319
Russell!

1059
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:43,124
Drop it!

1060
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,970
Walk away!

1061
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,445
Drop it, Russell! Drop it!

1062
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,161
Russ!

1063
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,559
Just listen to me!
