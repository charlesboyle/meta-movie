(MAC AND KELLY MOANING)

2
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,919
MAC: Okay, it's happening.
It's spontaneous.

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,479
This... Who saw this coming?
I did not see this coming.

4
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,799
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, let's do it.

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,319
Okay. It's happening.
It's totally happening.

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,479
BOTH: Whoo!

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,679
What a twist.
Oh, yeah. Okay.

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,479
This is so spontaneous.

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,679
We're having sex one minute...

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,159
Who knows what's
gonna happen next?

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,759
Who knows what we'll be
doing in 10 minutes?

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,919
- Okay.
- This is crazy!

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,999
We're doing this on
the dining room...

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,879
I've never had sex on a dining
room chair in my whole life.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,359
- (MOANING)
- This is amazing.

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,639
I'm taking you to
Boner Town, bitch.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,639
- Don't call me "bitch!"
- Okay. I'm sorry.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,159
I'm taking you to
Boner Town, love. Okay.

(CONTINUES MOANING)

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,062
Baby? Baby?

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,359
She's totally
fucking looking at us.

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,599
Hey, baby.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,759
She knows what's happening.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,839
She totally knows
what's happening.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,839
(LAUGHS) She can't see anything.
She just sees shapes.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,759
She sees shapes fucking each other,
is what she sees. She can...

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,639
She's fine.
She just sees shapes.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,719
It's like bouncing balls.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,319
My bouncing balls.

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,959
- She's fine. She's fine.
- You know what?

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,479
Let me turn her around.
Let me turn her around.

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,599
Okay. Okay.

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,839
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, little girl.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,559
Gonna turn around now.
Gonna look at the wall now.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,679
Let's go.

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,660
Okay. There you go.
Love you, sweetie. Okay.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,199
Okay! Let's do it.

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,359
We're back.
We're back in business.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,399
Okay. Okay.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,879
We are back.
It's happening. Okay.

(BOTH MOANING)

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,719
MAC: Oh, God. She keeps
turning... Turn around.

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,079
Just look that way.
Just turn around.

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,199
Why is she... Okay.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,679
I think it's over.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,759
We still did that.

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,599
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay. We still did that.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,559
Hello.

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,719
What are you doing
in your Jumperoo?

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,879
This never happened.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,719
- We're gonna finish that.
- We will finish that.

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,559
FYI, we're gonna
do it in every room.

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,559
And this time,
I'm going to ejaculate.

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,319
Just because we have
a house and a baby

55
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,959
doesn't mean that
we're old people.

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,399
No. Fuck old people.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,079
Old people don't
fuck like we just did.

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,719
Baby, I nearly came.

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,239
This is like The Brady Bunch.

60
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,479
I know! What's
nice about the house

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,559
is that it looks like every
penny we have is inside of it.

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,999
So, at least it looks like it.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,399
It's legitimate, right?

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,425
- Neighbors. Hey.
- Hi.

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,599
- Hey.
- Oh. Gay couple.

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,439
- There's a gay couple.
- Gay couple.

67
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,439
- They seem like a nice couple.
- They're so happy.

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,959
- That's awesome!
- Dream!

69
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,799
It is. Well,
it's the second dream.

70
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,079
First dream, Taco Bell opens next door.
That would be fucking dope.

71
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,759
- Hi!
- Hi!

72
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,831
Hey. It's a fabulous
neighborhood.

(STELLA CRYING ON BABY MONITOR)

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,399
- Oh, she's awake.
- Really?

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,159
- She's awake.
- Okay.

76
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,319
- Okay.
- Uh... Well, bye.

77

Okay. Bye. Love you.

Love you. Bye.
Have a good day.

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,639
Can I come?

80
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,839
(LAUGHS) Kidding.

81
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,661
No, we'll have a great day! We'll
have a great day. Okay. Bye!

82
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,301
I love you!

MAC: Hey!

85
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,319
Hey, there he is.

86
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,439
Hey.

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,679
I need that
Mendelson file by 4:00.

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,959
Okay, yeah.

89
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,279
And this is not your bro, this
is your boss talking. (CHUCKLES)

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,879
I'll have it to you
by 3:30. How's that?

91
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,439
- Mac!
- Okay.

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,559
Mac!

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,639
What?

94
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,471
Wait. Hold on.

95
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,759
Whoo!

96
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,307
Okay!

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,319
(PANTING) Oh, jeez, it's so far.

98
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,999
Hey, we gotta go work on that
thing we were discussing.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,079
- What thing?
- What's going on?

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,479
We have to go work
on that joint file.

101
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,759
Of course. The joint file.

102
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,199
You guys are doing a joint file?

103
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,319
We have a joint file together.

104
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,959
JIMMY: Yeah. We're pretty
deep into it. It's tight.

105
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,839
- It's pretty thick.
- It's a big file.

106
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,759
- Pretty fat file.
- It's dank.

107
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,999
- We should blaze through it, probably.
- Yeah.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,319
Yeah, we gotta file that
for the THC Corporation.

109
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,799
Okay.

110
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,631
Because we are in the weeds.

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,999
- How's Stella?
- She's a cute baby.

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,039
It's nice.

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,639
I think I realized for the first
six months, everything is fucked.

114
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,079
- Everything changes completely.
- Yeah.

115
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,799
You're like, "My life is over!
Everything's different!

116
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,399
"Everything I could do,
I can't do anymore."

117
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,359
But now, I realize that that's
all gonna go back to normal.

118
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,359
- You sure about that?
- She can start drinking soon.

119
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,159
They make these little strips that
test your tit milk for alcohol.

120
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,519
She puts them on her tits?

121
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,639
Yeah, she puts them on her tits.
Her tits are huge right now.

122
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,159
- Are they really?
- But I can't touch them.

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,079
She won't even let me see
them, is what's fucked up.

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,159
- What?
- When we have sex,

125
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,679
she leaves a wife-beater on.

126
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,479
It's like having sex
with Tony Soprano.

127
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,559
You're the goomah
in this situation.

128
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,679
Yeah, it's fucked up.

129
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,879
You are the only one of our friends
that has a house and a kid.

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,959
Yeah.

131
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,279
It's like you're, like, 10 years
older than everyone, you know?

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,479
You're divorced.

133
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,981
The point is...

134
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,959
It's Jimmy time.
You know what I mean?

135
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,599
And the girls,
when you're dating...

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,039
- Yeah?
- Holy shit!

137
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,999
See, we missed out
on the whole, kind of,

sex-tech bubble,
you know what I mean?

139
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,719
Now they got Sex Book
and Fuck Friends and...

140
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,559
There's this thing called
Grindr, which is just...

141
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
Your phone beeps when there's
someone horny near you.

142
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,519
It's kind of amazing.

143
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,466
It's mostly guys, but I'm gonna
find a girl pretty soon.

144
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,719
JIMMY: You're up.

145
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,039
Oh, oh! Oh!

146
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,159
Hey.

147
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,661
What are you guys doing out here?

148
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,359
- There are the girls.
- KELLY: Hi.

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,239
- How's it going, sweetie?
- Good.

150
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,559
What's happening?

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,159
There you go.

152
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,959
She's excited to see you.

153
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,919
Wait, wait. Hey.

154
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,070
(BABBLES)

155
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,519
Man, parenting is easy.
Look at that!

156
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,919
Yeah, two hours a day.

157
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,421
Yeah.

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,279
This is delightful. This
is awesome, this thing.

159
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,119
We should get one of
these above our bed.

- Hello?
- Hey!

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,959
Oh, my God. You guys have
to come out with me.

163
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,199
I haven't seen you in forever.

164
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,599
Yeah. What's going on?

165
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,199
Okay. My friend is spinning
at the Royalton tonight.

166
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,159
There's a rumor that
Prince might perform.

167
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,759
I really need to
get out of the house.

168
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,719
I have not been out since
Jimmy and I got divorced

169
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,399
and I really need you
there. Please?

170
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,039
How do we do this? Do I
call the babysitter bunch?

171
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,399
I don't know about that.
Let's just...

172
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,799
- It's too late. We'll...
- Okay.

173
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,119
Why don't you drop it

519
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,919
This is where we keep
all the important shit.

520
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,399
Alcohol, drugs, passports,
ping-pong paddles.

521
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,199
Those things are always
fucking disappearing.

522
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,999
Yeah, dude. My bros is
always stealing my paddies.

523
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,159
Right? What the fuck?

524
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,879
Holy shit! That's a
lot of fireworks.

525
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,079
Can we light some of
those off right now?

526
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,239
No.

527
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,079
Man, literally, the last time we lit
those off, we burned the house down.

528
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,359
(CHUCKLING)

529
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,227
It's not funny.
That was really bad.

530
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,679
Check this out.
Watch the yard.

531
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,261
- Ready?
- Yeah.

(ALL CHEERING)

533
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,079
That's awesome.

534
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,759
Welcome to paradise.

535
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,919
Hey, who's Batman to you?

536
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,199
Like, when you think of
Batman, who's Batman?

537
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,279
Are you kidding me?

538
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,679
- Christian Bale?
- Christian Bale.

539
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,944
Michael Keaton is Batman to me.

540

541
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,799

Michael Keaton's Batman was like,

542
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,559
(IN RASPY VOICE)
"Hey, I'm Batman."

543
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,079
"No! Hey, I'm Batman!"

544
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,479
"No, dude, no. I'm Batman. This
is what Batman sounds like."

545
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,879
"I'm counting on it!"

546
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,599
"No, I'm counting on it.
I'm Batman."

547
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,719
We actually met
in college. Yeah.

548

GIRLS: Aw!

549
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,359
Yeah, I was here for
an exchange program.

550
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,439
I was only supposed
to stay a semester,

551
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,439
but then he convinced me
to hang around.

552
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,479
- ALL: Aw!
- Yeah.

553
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,479
What's cool is we're
almost roommates.

554
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,679
Dude, we are almost roommates.

555
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,319
Our rooms are, like, 10
feet away from each other.

556
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,559
Dude, we can have
walkie-talkies,

557
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,759
- actually.
- (GASPS)

558
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,199
It would just work all the time.
It would be awesome.

559
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,799
Let's get walkie-talkies and
talk to each other all the time.

560
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,559
- Walkie-talkies and earpieces and shit.
- Oh, my God.

561
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,719
That would be so dope.

562
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,839
It'd be so fun.

563
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,959
So, how did you meet Teddy?

564
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,542
I saw him.
He saw me.

565
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,479
Yeah.

566
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,399
It's a really romantic story.

567
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,919
Hold on to this moment,
man. Seriously, enjoy this.

568
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,599
Because soon, you fucking blink,

569
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,279
and you're the oldest
guy at the party,

570
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,599
and it's terrible.

571
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,439
You don't seem old.

572
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,341
You seem like a senior
that took a year abroad.

573
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,863
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

574

Bottom of my heart.

575
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,865
You want to swordfight?

- KELLY: I really needed that.
- MAC: Thank you so much.

581

Yeah, again,
if you can just generally

582
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,799
kind of, you know, keep it down.

583
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,959
Just keep it down.

584
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,319
- Just keep it down.
- Low.

585
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,599
That would be... That would be
fucking... That would be trill.

586
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,879
You really want us
to keep it down?

587
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,079
Yeah, like, every night.

588
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,759
Yeah, try to keep it down.

589
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,759
I'll give it the old college try.

590
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,999
- Nice! That was good.
- Nice.

591
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,359
- Cool, cool.
- How is that?

592
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,279
Just make sure if we're too
noisy, you call me first.

593
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,599
Don't call the cops, okay?

594
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,759
- Okay. Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah.

595
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,119
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

596
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,399
Do you promise?

597
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,639
I promise. We promise.

598
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,719
You promise? Okay. Because a
promise is a big deal to me.

599
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,199
- Okay.
- Okay.

600
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,359
- We promise.
- Thank you so much, guys.

601
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,279
I hope you guys come over and
try and hang with us some more.

602
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,759
- Yeah, dope, dope. Cool.
- It was a good time.

603
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,999
I'll go tell them to shh!

Hey, Teddy. It's Mac again.
Your neighbor.

609
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,879
You said to call if
it was ever too loud.

610
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,399
So, we're calling.
It's too loud.

611
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,839
Can you please keep it down?

It's 4:00 in the morning, our
baby's awake. She's freaking out.

Thank you.

Ten times.

615

I've called him ten times.
What do we do?

616
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,439
If we actually go over there
and tell them to keep it down,

617
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,479
we're gonna seem so lame.

618
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,559
We're gonna have to call the cops.

619

- We call the cops?
- Yes.

620

Yeah. What's happening?

You called about your neighbors?

I have a call, it's from Mac
Radner. That's you. Right?

have that information?

Okay, yes.

662
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,959
You called us.
Why did you call us?

663
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,359
I called the cops because
you were being noisy, man.

664
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,039
And I tried to get you to
stop, and you wouldn't stop.

with us just last night.

- Did you party with this kid?
- We don't party with them!

672
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,759
We shouldn't be in trouble. We
haven't done anything wrong.

We have a baby.
We're parents.

guys were partying with him.

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,759
You were being noisy.

690
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,319
We tried to call you.
I don't know what to say.

691
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,079
We called you five times,
you didn't answer us.

692
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,759
You made a promise
to me last night.

693
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,159
We were pissing.
We crossed streams.

694
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,759
Don't worry about it, you know?

695
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,319
"Hey, I'm Batman."
You know? Right?

696
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,559
No, we're done with that, bro.

697
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,359
- We're still cool, man. We're still cool.
- We're sorry.

698
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,199
I'm not mad.

699
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,279
I'm just disappointed.

700
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,748
Hey, come on.
Wait, let's just...

701
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,301
MAC: What's that?

702
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,959
Those are for you.

703
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,679
What the fuck?

704
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,420
Oh.

705
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,639
TEDDY: You shouldn't have
called the cops, bro!

706
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,426
Okay.

707
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,719
- (ALL SHOUTING)
- Okay, very good.

708
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,799
Very good.

709
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,559
- KELLY: Okay.
- Congratulations.

710
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,159
You better put that
in the recycling bin.

711
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,661
- All Of it.
- All Of it.

712
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,639
PETE: It's like Edward
Scissorhands. Do you like it?

713
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,319
It's a really expensive bush!

714
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,719
I'm sorry, I felt inspiration.
What was I supposed to do?

715
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,039
I'm about to rip this
shit out of the ground.

716
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,239
(GRUNTING)

717
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,919
- Fuck this bush!
- Fuck that bush, man!

718
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,559
- Fuck this bush!
- Fuck that bush!

719
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,839
Harder, man. Yeah,
really get in there.

720
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,559
- Oh! Oh!
- God damn it! Kelly!

721
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,119
Whoa. Hey, man,
buy him dinner first.

722
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,621

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,439
Okay. Ha-ha.

726
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,863
Sorry, man. Sorry my ball
just got in your face.

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,663

- Baby.

Oh, God.

730
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,105
I can't believe this is happening.

731
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,079
It's finally happening.

(ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

- Oh, my God!

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,279
Oh, no! Oh, no!

735
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,199
We can't be the only people
in the neighborhood

736
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,359
who are sick of
this bullshit, you know.

737
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,919
We've gotta get
everyone on our side.

738
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,199
We could lead a revolution.

739
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,701
Oh, no.

740
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,319
They're buying off the whole
neighborhood with their slave army.

741
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,983
Oh! Mrs. Haywood,
you're better than that.

742
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,479
I can't sell your house.

743
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,639
- Why?
- Well,

744
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,510
because the only people who would
want to live next to a frat house

745
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:01,999
is a frat house.

746
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,959
Oh, the university
might be interested.

747
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,879
I know the Spanish department
is looking for a new building.

748
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,639
Only thing, if you
sell to the university,

749
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,199
I'd say, optimistically,
you're looking

750
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,039
at losing about
half your investment.

751
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,399
MAC: Half of all of our...

752
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,919
- We put all of our money in.
- This is all of our money.

753
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,079
We can't lose half.

754
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,559
But you keep half.

755
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,239
We don't need that!
What is that?

756
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,479
Sold!

757
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,239
And you keep making
money no matter what!

759
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,319
Okay, maybe it's best you just go.

760
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,719
- Thank you for coming.
- Okay.

761
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,919

- What are you doing?
- Yeah.

a Robert De Niro party.

Should be pretty fucking loud.

pretty fucking late, too.

violated the circle of trust, Focker.

called the cops, okay?

There's a clear
focus going on here.

827
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,359
I heard they burned
down their last house.

828

And they were
reprimanded for that.

829
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,679
We have a very strict three-strike
policy at this school.

830

So, they have one strike. If they
get two more, then they're out.

831
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,839
A strike?

Well, listen,
the way I do my job is,

833
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,359
you know, I'm always thinking
about the headlines, right?

834
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,239
So, "Duke Lacrosse Team Rapes
Stripper." Bad headline.

835
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,119
"Fraternity Keeps Couple Awake"?

836
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,359
That's not really even a headline.

837
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,559
I don't even think it would
make the local police blotter.

838
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,559
Get ready to read
the headline of the century.

839
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,719
Extra, extra!
"Baby Swallows Condom!"

840
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,559
- That's disgusting!
- Exactly!

841
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,119
- It's the frat's condom!
- That's the frat's condom!

842
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,799
I have a headline for this.

843
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,159
"Fraternity
Practices Safe Sex."

844
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,559
That's a good headline. I could
get a raise off that headline.

845
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,119
I got a headline for you.

846
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,479
"Mean Dean Doesn't Realize That
Frat ls Bad For Everyone."

847
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,719
It's really not.

848
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,119
It's very poorly worded. I don't think
that would ever make it to print.

849
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,439
I don't know where
you went to school.

850
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,959
I went here, okay?
That's why I'm dumb!

851
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,159
You know what? I just thought
of another headline.

852
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,903
"Negligent Parents
Allow Baby to Swallow Condom."

853
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,504
- What'd you say?
- It's not a good headline.

854
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,119
Here's a headline. How
about, "Go Fuck Yourself"?

855
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,279
That's what you get.

856
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,559
- This is our home!
- It's our home!

857
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,919
This is our little cub on our
lawn with a condom in her mouth.

858
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,919
Oh, my God.
I'm a mama bear.

859
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,119
- Yes, you are.
- You know what?

I'm gonna act all
docile and then...

861
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,519
(BOTH ROARING)

862
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,102
My claws are out!
I'm gonna fucking get them!

863
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,679
- (HISSING)
- Fuck these fucking guys!

864
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,359
They don't know who
they are fucking with.

865
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,279
They think I'm just a regular dad

866
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,079
and then you know what happens?

867
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,439
Boom! Boom!

868
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,039
Teddy's dead!
Pete's dead! Scoonie's dead!

869
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,279
- Fuck you!
- No, no.

870
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,799
- I'll fucking kill them!
- No, no.

871
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,479
- Boom!
- No.

872
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,079
- I'm buying a fucking gun!
- No, you're not!

873
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,439
I'm not buying a gun!
You're right, it's a bad idea.

874
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,519
Bad call.

875
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,679
What about one of those
small prostitute guns?

876
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,519
No. You're not buying a gun.

877
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,759
(EXHALES) Fuck!

878
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,119
What can we do?
That fucking Dean.

879
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,559
What woman is named "Dean"?

880
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,479
She's not named "Dean."
That's her job.

881
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,479
- What?
- That's what "dean" is here.

882
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,639
- No.
- Yeah.

883
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,159
- Really?
- What did you think?

884
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,559
- I thought that was her name.
- No.

885
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,759
Oh, no.

886
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,799
- What do they call it in Australia?
- "Chancellor."

887
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,719
No, she's the chancellor.

888
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,839
Oh, my God.
I was so rude to her.

889
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,839
- I don't know what to do.
- What do we know?

890
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,159
What didn't we have in college?

891
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,839
I didn't have any money.

892
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,079
- I had no money either.
- We had no money.

893
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,319
They're broke. They
don't have any money.

894
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,159
We fuck with their house.
They can't afford to fix it.

895
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,639
- Yes.
- They have to move.

896
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,999
- Yeah, fuck them!
- Fuck them!

897
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,279
- We're gonna fucking fuck them!
- Fuck them!

898
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,703
- We are going to fuck them!
- Fuck them!

899
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,181
(BOTH SCREAMING)

900
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,999
(ALL GROANING)

901
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,959
- So the water came out of here?
- Yep.

902
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,519
This is gonna ruin us.

903
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,359
I mean, the foundation is flooded.
We can't pay for this shit.

904
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,039
They're gonna condemn the house.

905
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,519
Okay, well, on that note,

906
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,159
maybe we should clean up and not

907
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,185
stand here with our
dicks in our hands.

908
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,464
"Dicks in our hands."

909
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,949
Dicks in our hands.

910
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,029
Dicks in our hands.

911
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,549
Dicks in our hands.

912
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,799
Dicks in our hands.

913
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,239
Teddy, how much time we got?

914
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,559
Just a couple minutes, and
then we pour in the latex.

915
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,142
We've got Delta Psi dildos
we can merchandise.

916
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,782
Oh, God, I can't keep
my boner much longer.

917
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,359
We're supposed to have boners?

918
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,399
Yeah. Nobody wants a limp dildo.

919
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,159
You don't know that. People
could want it for after.

920
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,759
Like, for cuddling,
and it's like a love...

921
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,599
Okay, you're right.
It's just a limp dick.

922
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,399
Hey, you boys have to go digital.

923
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,039
Look at that
3-D printer go.

924
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,159
Look at it go!

925
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,599
That's awesome.

926
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,759
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Penis completed.

927
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,439
Now I can go to class
while my dick prints.

928
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,559
Where did you get that?

929
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,239
Got it at my architecture lab.
Pretty cool, right?

930
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,679
- Wow.
- Man, you should go to class sometime.

931
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,039
We have excellent facilities
that, like, no one uses.

932
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,159
All right, let's pull these bad
boys off and see what we've got.

933
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,279
- We're good?
- Yeah.

934
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,479
GARF: Let's do it.

935
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,519
- This is like Christmas.
- Oh!

936
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,101
- Wow.
- Whoa.

937
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,719
Hey, you know, I think the
clay is stuck to my pubes.

938
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,585
Why do you have pubes?

939
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,959
Wait. You guys shaved?

940
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,759
Dude, I texted you.
I said, "Shave."

941
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,919
I thought we were taking pictures.
I cleaned up a little, but...

942
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,467
Not your face.

943
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,799
Oh, God.

944
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,039
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

945
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,439
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm gonna enjoy this.

946
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,599
It's not gonna come off.

947
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,959
I'm just gonna leave it on.

948
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,559
I'm gonna drill a hole, I'm gonna pee.
I can get bigger pants.

949
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,439
Look at me.
You trust me, right?

950
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,479
I'm gonna pull this thing off.

951
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,639
Come on, just relax.
I got you.

952
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,039
Stay the fuck away from me!

953
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,799
Calm down. Count of three.

954
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,439
- Teddy...
- One.

955
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,479
Look at my eyes.

956
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,311
- Two!
- (SHRIEKS)

957
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,639
That was so much
worse than I thought.

958
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,559
SCOONIE:
Ladies, I need a single-file line.

959
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,919
There will be no
cutting in this line,

960
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,399
and if you're in the back, it is
approximately a 20-minute wait.

961
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,639
- Hey.
- Hi.

962
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,999
- Um... I'll take a Teddy.
- Cool. How about a Pete?

963
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,319
Oh, no.

964
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,639
I was just kidding, anyway.

965
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,999
So weird.

966
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,119
Holy shit, guys.
I think we made $10,000.

967
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,999
Hey, you guys, if my
calculations are correct,

968
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,919
not only can we
fix the water damage,

969
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,583
but we can get the biggest
hot tub in the world!

970
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,799
- (CHEERING)
- And outdoor speakers!

971
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,999
- Yes!
- Yeah!

972
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,799
Delta Psi!

973
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,439
ALL: (CHANTING) Delta Psi.

974
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,519
Delta Psi!
Delta Psi! Delta Psi!

975
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,039
Dildo Psi!

976
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,111
Dildo Psi! Dildo Psi!

977
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,065
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

978
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,239
This is fucking ridiculous.

979
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,439
This is ridiculous.

980
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,519
Their dicks bought a hot tub?
My dick couldn't buy a hot tub.

981
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,879
Hey.

982
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,543
Your dick could buy more than a
hot tub. Your dick bought me.

983
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,159
Thank you very much.

984
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,799
I'm not a sizeist.

985
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,064
That's a little patronizing.

986
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,706
(MOUTHING)

987
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,470
I don't get it. Who would
even buy one of those dildos?

988
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,319
Bros before hos.

989
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,399
Why? Because your bros
are always there for you.

990
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,199
They have got your back after
your ho rips your heart out.

991
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,559
"Bros before hos."

992
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,319
And you were nothing
but great to your ho.

993
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,879
And you told her that she
was the only ho for you,

994
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,543
and that she was better than all
the other hos in the world.

995
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,062
Bros before hos.

996
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,239
Fraternities. They live and die
on the concept of brotherhood.

997
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,319
I know.

998
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,359
The only way to break it
apart is to get in there,

999
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,079
infiltrate a party, and get
them to put hos before bros.

1000
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,439
Hos don't go before bros. It
just doesn't work like that.

1001
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,919
A ho has never gone before a bro.

1002
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,199
Maybe I have been a ho
who's taken down some bros.

1003
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,919
- Ho, no, you haven't.
- I'm just saying.

1004
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,119
You have? That is messed up.

1005
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,519
I'm saying, that's the only way.

1006
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,279
We've got to get in there,
we gotta infiltrate.

1007
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,039
Get those little motherfuckers,
turn them against each other.

1008
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,239
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

1009
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,519
Just ease up.

1010
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,759
Sorry.

1011
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,879
She's on the fast road to her
first word being "cunt."

1012
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,679
- It's not cool here.
- Sorry.

1013
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,399
We're gonna make them
put hos before bros.

1014
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,471
Step one, lock down a babysitter.

1015
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,199
Get this one taken care of.

1016
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,439
- Yeah?
- Right?

1017
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,559
- Yeah?
- Right?

1018
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,903
- Yeah.
- We're gonna get these guys.

1019
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,279
- Yo.
- I've been waiting forever.

1020
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,479
- Yeah, glad you made it.
- Whoa, whoa!

1021
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,639
- What is she doing here?
- Wait. What is he doing here?

1022
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,079
Look, we're friends
with both of you.

1023
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,479
Fucking just learn
to deal with it, okay?

1024
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,119
This is an abomination.

1025
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,959
You... Right now, both of you
have to make a choice right now.

1026
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,239
Me or her, choose.
It's up to you. You choose.

1027
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,279
Shut the fuck up.

1028
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,225
We're on a mission.

1029
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,265

I think I should probably pump.

1202
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,879
My boobs are feeling really full.

1203
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,119
I like 'em like that.

1204
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,100
I like 'em full, baby.

1205
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,199
- We did it.
- We did it.

1206
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,799
That's a beautiful thing.

1207

1214
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,879
- I gotta feed Stella.
- Okay.

1215
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,224
Is she awake?
I'm more milk than woman.

1216
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,399
I gotta get this out of me.

1217
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,390
Get it out of you.

1218
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,399
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

1219

Whoa. Wait. Wait.

1222
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,119
- No, no, no!

1223
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,719
Don't slap my boob.

1224

There's booze in your boobs.

I need this milk out of me.

1229
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,868

- Get the pump. Ow!

1230
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,199
Okay, I got it.

1231
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,199

Fuck. Oh, no. Okay, relax.

1234
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,439
I'm sorry. What the fuck?

1235
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,599
It broke.
I totally broke it.

1236
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,799
I don't even know what
the fuck to do with this.

1237
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,959
Oh, no.

1238

Oh, they're Hulking out!
They're gonna blow.

What is happening to me?

1241
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,628
Oh, gross! They look
like my grandma's legs.

1242
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,759
Okay, let me call my mom. She'll
tell us what to do right now.

1243
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,279
Do not call your mother!

1244
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,799
Jesus! You Jews and
your fucking mothers!

1245

What do I do?

1246
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,199
- Milk me.
- What?

1247
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,439
You're gonna have to milk me.

1248
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,479
- I don't want to milk you.
- Well, you're gonna have to.

I don't fucking want to!
What do you mean "milk you"?

You don't have a choice!

1251
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,679
Be a man and milk me.

1252

- I'm not a cow!
- Well, how else do you do it?

Just, normal.

1260
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,319
There's no normal way
to milk a human woman.

I'm gonna move back to
Australia if you don't stop.

Please stop.

How much of you is
traumatized? 2%? 1%?

1291

That was a cheesy one.

- Jasmine from Aladdin!

1372
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,919
Yes!

1373
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,149
We just said it at the same time!

1374
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,679
All right, man,
I should probably...

1375
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,839
But, I'll see you
back at the house, yeah?

1376
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,879
See you, brother.

1377
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,381
- All right. Good talk, man.
- Later.

1378
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,759
Hey! You Delta Psi?

1379
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,399
Yeah. Are you a Delta?

1380
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,870
No, my roommate was. I used to
wear his ties to get girls.

1381
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,425
You interested in
working for AT&T?

1382
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,665
What do you guys do?

1383
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,039
We're a giant
telecommunications corporation.

1384
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,719
- Cell phones.
- Oh.

1385
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,199
What's your GPA?

1386
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,906
Like, low twos.

1387
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,662
I'm just kidding. High ones.

1388
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,879
We're actually
looking for candidates

1389
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,719
that are a little more
academically inclined.

1390
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,239
So, you have a nice day.

1391
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,741
What does that mean?

1392
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,910
It means you're too dumb.

1393
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,679
Good luck, bro.

1394
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,227
Okay.

1395
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,599
PETE: I hope we can "build"
a great future together.

1396
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,101
Architecture joke.

1397
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,261
I know!

1398
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,759
I like to have fun with it.

1399
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,500
Lame.

1400
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,079
- Big Mac!
- Yo!

1401
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,879
- There he is.
- Hey!

1402
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,319
- Hey.
- Hello.

1403
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,959
You know, I was just thinking,

1404
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,719
it would be great
to have you and Kelly

1405
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,559
and your little princess
over for a play date.

1406
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,559
- We'll put it on the books.
- Okay, cool. Great.

1407
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,279
Sometime soon. I'll just...
I'll get back to you.

1408
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,781
- Yeah.
- Great.

1409
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,519
"And the dog goes,
'Woof, woof, woof, woof!

1410
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,422
"'Woof, woof, woof!"'

1411
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,959
- Oh, hi, baby.
- MAC: How's it going?

1412
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,479
Oh, good. Yeah, I'm good, I'm fine.

1413
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,599
I'm fine.

1414
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,479
I'm a bit bored,
but I'm fine. I'm fine.

1415
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,839
Yeah, I'm bored, too.

1416
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,639
My boss just invited us
for a play date,

1417
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,239
so we can both
just kill each other.

1418
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,479
(STELLA CRYING ON MONITOR)

1419
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,999
I kind of miss the rush
of messing with the frat.

1420
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,679
I have to go. She's awake.

1421
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,989
Okay, call me after.
Call me soon.

1422
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,665
TEDDY: Hey, neighbor.

1423
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,279
Ooh!

1424
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,906
(ALL LAUGHING)

1425
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,519
Okay. Are you ready?

1426
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,199
Me and Kelly, we have found a way

1427
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,999
to give the frat
their last strike.

1428
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,719
- Get them out of here forever!
- Out!

1429
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,239
Why are we doing this? Didn't
we already win? Remember?

1430
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,599
"Bros before hos,"
that whole thing? It's over!

1431
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,719
They're still fucking there!
There's beer cans on the lawn.

1432
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,799
They're barbecuing.

1433
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,999
- So?
- "So?"

1434
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,359
It smells delicious in here.

1435
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,999
Try living next to it.
Try living next to it!

1436
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,679
Hey, you guys don't
want to go back to your

1437
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,319
boring ass lives as parents.
That's what it is.

1438
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,319
I'm surprised and
shocked, honestly,

1439
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,039
that it is so hard
to convince you,

1440
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,679
of all people,
that this is a good idea.

1441
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,879
What?

1442
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,039
One of those childs is
having sex with your wife.

1443
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,199
It's fine. We're divorced.

1444
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,039
- Jimmy! Wake up!
- Wake up, man.

1445
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,199
His dick is this big!

1446
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,359
"Hey, homie. I'm gonna fuck
your wife with my giant dick."

1447
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,879
"Oh, my God,
this is amazing."

1448
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,319
"Oh, my God, homie.
It feels so good."

1449
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,599
- "Oh, homie."
- "Wow. Oh, my God."

1450
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,239
- "It feels so good, homie."
- "What are you doing later?"

1451
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,399
"Oh, homie, let's do it.
Oh, God, homie."

1452
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,519
"That's amazing."

1453
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,799
Okay, enough! Stop imitating!

1454
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,959
I get it! He's got a huge dick!

1455
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,119
And her vagina, "Bye!"
It's ruined!

1456
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,279
MAC: Destroyed. Gone!

1457
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,039
It's like when you lend
a fat friend your shirt,

1458
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,799
and it comes back, and it's
all stretchy and flappy!

1459
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,065
Sagging all over the place!
It'll be like this.

1460
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,199
- I'm in!
- MAC: Yes!

1461
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,239
Nice! Nice! Great!
Awesome, awesome!

1462
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,679
- What's the plan?
- Okay, okay.

1463
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,239
We've been thinking.
What gets frats

1464
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,185
kicked out of schools
more than anything?

1465
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,866
Rape!

1466
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,799
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1467
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,199
- Hazing scandals.
- Hazing scandals!

1468
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,239
- Yes!
- Hazing scandals!

1469
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,319
- Hazing scandals!
- Yes!

1470
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,199
You should've said it
before you let me answer.

1471
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,639
We need all that equipment
you bought to spy on Paula.

1472
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,711
I didn't...
(LAUGHS) What?

1473
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,599
Just stop.

1474
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,439
MAC: Look, you just take
these spy glasses.

1475
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,279
They look totally
like normal glasses.

1476
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,719
You wear them into the frat house.

1477
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,279
Teddy's gonna start
pushing you around

1478
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,759
and fucking with you,
like he always does.

1479
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,439
Like I've seen him
do a million times.

1480
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,919
At that moment,
you just push back.

1481
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,879
Okay? Just push back.

1482
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,559
The rest will take care of itself.

1483
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,199
He'll haze
the fucking shit out of you.

1484
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,959
It'll all get
caught on this camera.

1485
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,542
Delta Psi is gone,
you're a free man.

1486
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,999
Those guys are my brothers.

1487
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,119
KELLY: Your brothers?

1488
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,159
Do you think your brothers would
really treat you like that?

1489
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,439
Think about what
they've done to you.

1490
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,799
They dehumanized you.

1491
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,799
- They treated you like shit.
- They degraded you.

1492
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,439
- JIMMY: You're an animal.
- They called you Assjuice.

1493
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,599
Assjuice.

1494
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,079
- KELLY: Assjuice.
- MAC: Assjuice.

1495
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,839
- JIMMY: Subhuman.
- KELLY: Assjuice.

1496
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,759
ALL: Assjuice. Assjuice.

1497
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,959
Assjuice. Assjuice.

1498
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,359
Assjuice! Assjuice!
Assjuice! Assjuice!

1499
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,879
You better eat this
fucking dog food, now!

1500
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,427
(SCREAMING)

1501
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,199
PETE: What's the lesson?

1502
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,599
BOYS: Don't go to sleep!

1503
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,864
This is your destiny, Assjuice.

1504
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,519
Assjuice!

1505
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,959
ALL: (CHANTING)
Assjuice! Assjuice! Assjuice!

1506
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,639
Assjuice! Assjuice!

1507
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,679
I don't know.

1508
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,999
JIMMY: Everyone breaks, bro.

1509
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,279
Biology.

1510
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,111
That's from Zero Dark Thirty.

1511
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,670
You guys don't get it.

1512
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,679
I've gone through hell.

1513
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,839
I'm not gonna throw
that all away now.

1514
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,627
You know how many BJs
I've been promised?

1515
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,319
Infinite BJs.

1516
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,719
Infinite. Infinite.

1517
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,710
Infinite BJs.

1518
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,510
Delta Psi forever, ya bish.

1519
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,759
We'll give you $1,000.

1520
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,519
Okay. I'm in.

1521
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,039
Nice!

1522
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,039
- Nice! That was good!
- JIMMY: That was good. That was really good.

1523
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,030
That was good.
That was sexy, too.

1524
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,319
He looks like J.J. Abrams.

1525
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,999
MAC: You look good. It looks
okay. I think it's okay.

1526
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,159
You're never gonna forget this!

1527
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,159
Move, elephants!
Move! Keep marching.

1528
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,959
March!

1529
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,879
March, march, march, elephants.

1530
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,199
I'm not doing this anymore.

1531
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,279
Get back in line, Assjuice!

1532
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,519
Get back in line!

1533
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,599
Fuck you.
I am not an elephant!

1534
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,759
What did you just say to me?

1535
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,319
I am not an elephant!

1536
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,719
He's doing it.
He's doing it.

1537
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,559
I'm a human man!
I have dignity!

1538
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,559
- We all have dignity!
- Yes, Assjuice, yes!

1539
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,479
Our names are not Fuckhead,
or Jizzface, or Lea Michele.

1540
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,839
- Lea Michele from Glee?
- That's actually funny.

1541
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,119
Yeah, that's really funny.

1542
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,667
It's Evan.

1543
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,231
And Brendan.

1544
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,559
And Juan.

1545
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,599
So, fuck you.

1546
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,399
Haze me. Say it.

1547
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,399
- Say it! Come on!
- Say it, Teddy.

1548
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,079
I will haze you until your
fucking face falls off!

1549
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,423
ALL: Yeah!

1550
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,879
- That's great. Okay, okay.
- We did it.

1551
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,119
You're in so much fucking trouble.
Come with me, pledge.

1552
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,621
ASSJUICE: Oh, fuck.

1553
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,106
Fuck him up, Teddy.

1554
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,948
I'm sorry. I'll do anything.

1555
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,341
What's going on, Gary?

1556
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,239
Are you okay, man?
You seem distraught.

1557
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,919
"You seem distraught"?

1558
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,279
I mean, you've always been, in my
opinion, like, our strongest pledge,

1559
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,599
and now you're talking back.

1560
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,999
- ASSJUICE: I'm scared.
- You're scared?

1561
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,239
I'm fucking scared, man.
I'm tired all the time.

1562
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,439
Fucking tired.
I miss my mom.

1563
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,279
- Oh, no, Assjuice.
- Breaking? The guy was right.

1564
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,319
Everybody breaks.

1565
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,799
Okay. I'll tell you what.

1566
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,399
You go up to my room.

1567
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,119
Lock the door, draw
yourself a bath. Relax.

1568
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,679
- (GASPS)
- "Draw yourself a bath"?

1569
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,839
Catch up on some Z's,
okay? Take a nap.

1570
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,399
Full season of Girls
up there in the DVR.

1571
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,919
We never planned for nice.

1572
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,599
Thanks for talking to me,
brother. All right?

1573
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,501
You can always come to me with
this kind of stuff, all right?

1574
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,439
You're doing a great job.
See you upstairs.

1575
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,385
(BOTH IMITATING EXPLOSIONS)

1576
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,860
I'm sorry, guys.
He's too good of a dude.

1577
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,985
- No!
- Teddy!

1578
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,999
- What's up?
- Yeah, one more thing.

1579
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,119
No more thing!

1580
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,359
These glasses,
there's a camera in them.

1581
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,519
ALL: No!

1582
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,759
Oh, my God!

1583
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,999
The asset's gone rogue.

1584
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,079
Shit, he's still talking.

1585
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,159
ASSJUICE: Your neighbors
got me to wear them,

1586
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,479
so they could film you hazing us,

1587
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,039
so the fraternity
would get dissolved.

1588
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,199
And this isn't the first time. No, no,
no, no. They flooded the basement.

1589
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,431
They got Brother Pete to
hook up with Sister Brooke.

1590
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,239
I'm so sorry, man.

1591
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,679
- It's okay.
- They've been after us for weeks.

1592
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,199
- No!
- He's telling him everything!

1593
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,919
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ, guys!

1594
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,785
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1595
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,101
MAC: Wait.

1596
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,359
He's looking at us.

1597
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,703
- What are you doing?
- He's looking at us.

1598
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,424
You guys just crossed the
fucking line. You're dead.

1599
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,999
We're dead?

1600
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,159
(YELLS)

1601
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,199
- Oh, God! Oh, my God!
- That was scary.

1602
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,879
- Come on, guys.
- Jesus.

1603
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,999
How do you turn these off?

1604
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,865
ASSJUICE: It's on the side.

1605
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,199
(SINGING)
We're gonna go to the shops

1606
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,719
Then we're gonna
go to Mommy and Me

1607
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,199
And see all those
bitches that I hate

1608
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,159
It's gonna be really boring

1609
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,867
But we'll get out of the house!

1610
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,839
KELLY: I think the frat has broken into
the car and stolen all of the airbags.

1611
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,399
- Airbags?
- Yeah.

1612
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,239
That's so weird. Is
anything else missing?

1613
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,105
- No!
- Okay.

1614
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,919
Why would they just break in
and steal the airbags?

1615
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,910
I don't know. We should
file a police report...

1616
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,991
(GROANING)

1617
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,105
What the fuck?

1618
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,306
Oh, shit!

1619
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,671
Found the airbags!

1620
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,746
There's three left!

1621
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,159
Fuck!

1622
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,741
- Two left!
- (JIMMY GROANING)

1623
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,270
Jimmy, are you okay?

1624
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,759
I'm fine!

1625
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,759
It wasn't as bad as
it seemed. I'm fine.

1626
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,879
Delta Psi has the upper hand!

1627
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,906
We went too far now.
This is dangerous.

1628
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,639
We did not go too far.

1629
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,679
Now is when we get
them back even more.

1630
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,599
Do you see what they fucking
did to me? We don't stop now!

1631
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,919
So, what it's gonna be next? They're
gonna break into the house?

1632
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,039
No. No.

1633
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,959
You need to grow up, okay?
Our family is in danger.

1634
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,799
- I need to grow up?
- Yes, you need to grow up.

1635
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,999
One of us has got to be the
adult in this relationship.

1636
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,279
You should take responsibility.

1637
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,719
That's not only offensive,
but it's fucking stupid.

1638
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,639
It's offensive that I'm saying
that you should be smart?

1639
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,479
Yes, it's offensive that I have
to be the smart one all the time!

1640
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,999
I'm allowed to be
just as irresponsible as you.

1641
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,399
Well, that's how it works!
I'm the dumb guy,

1642
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,919
and you're the woman
who's supposed to

1643
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,439
stop the dumb guy
from doing dumb shit!

1644
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,599
Haven't you ever seen
a fucking Kevin James movie?

1645
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,839
We can't both be Kevin
James. I'm Kevin James!

1646
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,679
I have a little bit
of Kevin James in me.

1647
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,799
Well, we can't both...

1648
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,119
Clearly, you're the one who knows
better, so you should know better.

1649
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,319
You know that I'm not like that,
and I've never been like that.

1650
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,999
- Well, maybe you should be.
- That's never been me.

1651
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,519
Just because I'm a
mom doesn't mean

1652
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,079
that I'm gonna change who I am.

1653
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,319
Well, just because I'm a father,

1654
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,999
it doesn't mean I can stop doing
mushrooms with teenagers.

1655
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,119
- Fine!
- Fine!

1656
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,159
- Good.
- Good, then.

1657
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,159
Okay, Kevin, I don't think
we're a good team anymore.

1658
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,319
- The team is breaking up.
- Yep.

1659
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,359
This worked before
we had Stella, but...

1660
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,159
- Now it doesn't.
- It doesn't work anymore.

1661
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,519
Yeah, because someone
refuses to grow up.

1662
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,599
- Fine. Okay.
- Fine then.

1663
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,519
You go find your
nagging wife that you

1664
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,319
want to find, and I'll
go find a real man.

1665
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,879
- Fine! Good to know.
- Fine.

1666
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,319
I don't feel safe here,
just in case you didn't know.

1667
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,559
Well, that's crazy.

1668
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,719
I'm gonna take our child and go.

1669
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,079
Oh, yeah? Well,
that's ludicrous,

1670
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,239
because this is perhaps the
safest place on the planet,

1671
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,479
just so you know!

1672
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,999
- You're kidnapping our baby!
- Asshole!

1673
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,639
Don't kidnap our baby!

1674
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,519
I'm gonna put out
an AMBER fucking Alert!

1675
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,559
Enjoy the house by
yourself, you child!

1676
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,505
This is safer
than the White House!

1677
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,711
(GROANING)

1678
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,559
Dude, we missed the airbag!

1679
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,639
Kelly, there's one left!

1680
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,665
It could be anywhere!

1681
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,791
Ow!

1682
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,559
Hey, man, do you think, maybe we're
going, like, way too far with this?

1683
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,679
I mean, as a child
of divorce, I just...

1684
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,399
I can't help it,
I sympathize with them.

1685
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,063
Well, my parents love each other,
and I think it's hilarious.

1686
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,431
(SCREAMS)

1687
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,421
Fuck!

1688
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,421
Fuckers! Fuck!

1689
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,627
Shalom, Mac.

1690
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,639
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

1691
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,879
- How's it going?
- I'm sorry.

1692
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,479
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1693
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,719
I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.

1694
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,879
I love you, I'm sorry.

1695
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,279
I was so stupid.

1696
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,119
What a stupid
fucking fight to have.

1697
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,439
No, I was stupid.
I'm really, really sorry.

1698
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,799
I'm so sorry.
It was so dumb.

1699
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,479
- It was really dumb.
- I love you so much, okay?

1700
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,839
- Do you still like me?
- I miss you. I love you.

1701
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,079
- Do you still like me?
- Yes, I still like you.

1702
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,184
- Okay, good. I love you.
- Okay.

1703
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,719
She's so crazy.

1704
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,426
She's still behind you.

1705
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,509
- Hey.
- Hi.

1706
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,145
Lame, isn't it, Pete?

1707
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,999
Whoa.

1708
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,106
You're really
villaining out in here.

1709
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,669
What's lame?
What's going on?

1710
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,388
Lame that we're on probation.

1711
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,319
We're not gonna
end up on this thing.

1712
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,199
That is kind of lame, but also
kind of meaningless, right?

1713
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,639
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1714
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,999
No, man. I just mean, like,
you're the President, you know?

1715
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,119
If you want to be up there so
bad, just put your picture up.

1716
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,159
No one's gonna stop you.

1717
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,788
Because then I didn't earn it.

1718
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,199
It doesn't mean anything
if you don't earn it.

1719
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,145
Who cares?

1720
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,185
"Who cares?"

1721
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,384
Are you kidding me?

1722
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,029
You're the VP, man.

1723
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,679
We have wanted this
since we were freshmen.

1724
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,079
Dude, that was
four years ago, okay?

1725
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,359
We were fucking virgins. All right?

1726
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,519
We're about to be,
like, adults now.

1727
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,039
In two weeks, none of this
is even gonna matter.

1728
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,479
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1729
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,879
I mean, you do realize that all this
stuff, it's all bullshit, right?

1730
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,319
It's all made up.

1731
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,839
Like, my brother's fraternity also
thinks they invented beer pong.

1732
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,039
Well, your brother is a liar.

1733
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,110
All right, let's put that down.

1734
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,879
Dude, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

1735
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,719
but I think you're freaking out

1736
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,439
about what you're
gonna do next year.

1737
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,919
What?

1738
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,399
I'm trying to be
your friend, okay?

1739
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,439
But I don't know why you try
to hide this stuff from me.

1740
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,279
I'm a psychology minor,
you know that.

1741
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,599
"I'm a psychology minor."

1742
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,599
Dude, why do you think
you're so obsessed

1743
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,559
with that old couple
next door, all right?

1744
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,399
It's because they
remind you of the future.

1745
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,679
I'm sorry, but it's true.

1746
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,239
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1747
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,679
- You're trying to be my friend?
- Yes!

1748
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,719
Well, why don't you go
fuck my girlfriend again?

1749
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,119
- What?
- Yeah.

1750
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,759
I thought we were over
that. What are you...

1751
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,559
How the fuck could I
be cool with that, man?

1752
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,319
You had sex with my girlfriend!

1753
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,319
What are you... We said all
those things, all right?

1754
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,999
They rhymed!
What the hell was that?

1755
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,839
We said some shit that rhymed?
Are you crazy, man?

1756
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,519
How the fuck would
that make me feel better?

1757
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,119
You don't think I was clearly
trying to mask how I really felt,

1758
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,479
so I tried to bro out with you?

1759
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,279
I don't know!
You're a good actor!

1760
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,079
What the fuck am I
supposed to think?

1761
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,599
Get the fuck out of here!

1762
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,159
God! Dude, take your shit out
on someone else, all right?

1763
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,759
- This isn't about me.
- Okay.

1764
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,103
That's right, Pete. Walk away.

1765
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,599
- Bitch.
- Oh, my God.

- What do you want? It's over.
- Yeah.

nothing else.

"and everything's
gonna be fine."

1785
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,999
But it won't.

1786
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,946
Because in a few weeks, when school
ends, so does our probation.

1787

Teddys living next door to you for all time.

they're on probation.

- They're being careful.

do anything ridiculous,

because they're
watching themselves.

didn't think they were on probation.

Thumbsucker! Let me see the

1881

Our school's insignia is in Latin.

1882
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,119
This is in Jewish!

1883
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,799
- What?
- We're not off probation!

1884
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,119
The old people have the upper hand.

1893
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,519
That means they know
the cops are coming.

How do they know
something's wrong?

1902
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,199
It's because of the Hebrew.

1903
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,319
I put a little Hebrew in the school
sign, you know, like a coded game.

Inside the school seal,

is Hebrew for "game over."

Why did you do that?

- Stop hitting me.
- MAC: That's so stupid!

1909
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,879
No! No, no!
It's like a wink, you know?

1910
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,559
Like at the end of a heist,
you leave your calling card.

1911
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,239
It's like,
"They got us again."

1912
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,159
One big difference,
the heist isn't done!

01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,022
I brought it into bed with us.

2217
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,663
I also got some
ranch dipping sauce.

2218
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,959
- Oh, my God.
- Mmm-hmm.

2219
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,599
That's the best idea.

2220
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,306
Yeah.

2221
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,706
Mmm!

2222
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,719
TEDDY: Welcome to Abercrombie.

2223
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,143
Come inside. Check out
some board shorts.

2224
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,270
Hey, Mac!

2225
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,879
- Hey, dude.
- What's up, man?

2226
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,039
- What up, man?
- How's it going?

2227
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,719
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

2228
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,039
You're one of those guys!

2229
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,359
- I am, yeah.
- Yeah.

2230
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,319
- It's a pretty good gig.
- Yeah.

2231
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,599
You'd be surprised, I actually
meet a shit-ton of girls here.

2232
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,839
Not that surprised.

2233
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,399
Your body basically
looks like a giant arrow

2234
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,799
pointing right towards your dick.

2235
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,839
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- No problem, man.

2236
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,919
- I think that's a compliment.
- It is a compliment.

2237
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,239
We went nuts.

2238
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,519
It escalated very quickly.

2239
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,263
It escalated to a really crazy place.
That was really nuts, man.

2240
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,919
How are the guys?

2241
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,759
They're all great. They got
a big house off campus.

2242
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,759
Pete's a fancy architect,
designing buildings and stuff.

2243
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,279
How's the rest of post-college
life treating you?

2244
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,999
It's good, man.
I'm having fun.

2245
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,919
I realize I probably should have
studied a little bit more.

2246
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,359
Little bit. (LAUGHS)

2247
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,999
But I'm going to night school
to get my degree, so...

2248
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,264
- Awesome, man.
- Yeah.

2249
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,759
Well, it's still
really good to see you, man.

2250
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,919
Great to see you too, buddy.

2251
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,119
- All right, brother.
- Good to see you.

2252
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,479
Bring it in for the real thing.

2253
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,679
Nice, okay.
Good to see you, dude.

2254
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,103
You know what?
While I'm here...

2255
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,479
I've always wanted to do this.

2256
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,159
All right. Wow,
you're really going for it.

2257
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,839
- I'm doing it.
- Oh, man.

2258
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,799
So, is it our posture?
Why do we look so different?

2259
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,959
I don't know, man.
Just be free.

2260
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,479
- Just kind of let it out.
- Okay.

2261
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,141
I feel free.

2262
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,941
(LAUGHS)

2263
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,519
Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.
Can we take your order?

2264
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,759
Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.

2265
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,919
Abercrombie, Fitch.

2266
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,279
- Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.
- How you doing?

2267
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,599
Can we take your order?

2268
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,119
- We're a great team.
- Thanks.

2269
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,031
You make the store
more approachable.

2270
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,639
What does that mean?

2271
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,679
(STAMMERS)

2272
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,839
It's like, I make...

2273
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,279
I'm a more obtainable goal.

2274
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,959
Yeah, you're like
the relaxed-fit jean guy.

2275
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,144
Yeah. I'm the relaxed-fit jeans.

2276
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,959
I made some blue meth.
It's Gatorade.

2277
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,159
Oh, perfect! Great.

2278
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,599
She's all ready to go.

2279
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,639
This is gonna be
the best calendar yet.

2280
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,839
Look at that, sweetie.

2281
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,359
All right. Let's do it.

2282
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,359
Who's my little Heisenberg? You are!

2283
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,639
She's a little meth head.

2284
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,799
No, she just makes it.

2285
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,586
- (COMPUTER RINGING)
- Oh...

2286
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,479
- Hey. Look who it is.
- JIMMY: What's up, dude?

2287
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,159
We're at Burning Man!

2288
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,839
Burning Man!

2289
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,159
KELLY: Hey!

2290
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,519
You guys should come here.

2291
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,519
- Bring Stella! You can bring kids!
- Bring Stella!

2292
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,839
- MAC: No.
- No, we're making a Stella calendar.

2293
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,039
Yeah, we got six months left.

2294
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,199
She's Heisenberg.
She's Walter White.

2295
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,319
- KELLY: See?
- You're such a lame-o!

2296
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,319
- Don't be so fucking lame!
- Totally lame.

2297
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,399
It's awesome!

2298
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,879
It only gets better and better!

2299
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,589
I feel completely comfortable
missing that party. Okay.

2300
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,359
- We gotta go, okay?
- KELLY: We gotta go.

2301
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,079
Yeah, have a good one.
Try not to die.

2302
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,439
What should we do next?

2303
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,039
- Don Draper. Yeah.
- MAC: Yeah, Don Draper.

2304
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,224
Let's get the leading
men out of the way.

2305
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,864
- I love you.
- I love you.

2306
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,079
- We love you.
- We love you.

2307
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,264
- Little Walter White.
- Baby.

2308
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,304
JIMMY: Sof hamisschak.
It means "game over."
