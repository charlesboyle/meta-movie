I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,473
It was a Horn & Hardart cafeteria.

4
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:26,145
And this beautiful girl walked in,
and I turned to Arthur...

5
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:31,358
..and I said "Arthur, you see that girl?
I'm going to marry her."

6
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,111
And two weeks later we were married.

7
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,573
And it's over 50 years later,...

8
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,033

It's an 18-hour trip, which becomes
six shifts of three hours.

Or, alternatively,
we could break it down by mileage.

We got 18 hours to kill
before New York.

00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:12,060
That won't even get us out of Chicago.
Nothing's happened to me yet.

47
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,730
- So I'm going to New York.
- So something'll happen?

48
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,273
- Yes.
- Like what?

49
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,900
Like I'm going to journalism school.

50
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,195
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

51
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,074
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens.

52
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,911
Suppose you never meet anybody,
you never become anything,...

53
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,498
..then you die and
nobody notices for two weeks

54
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,751
until the smell drifts into the hall.

55
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,423
- Amanda said you had a dark side.
- That's what drew her to me.

56
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,885
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?

57
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,680
I know, you probably
dot your "i"s with little hearts.

58
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,475
I have just as much of a dark side
as the next person.

59
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,145
Oh, really? When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

60
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,106
That way, if I die before I finish
I know how it ends.

61
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,609
That, my friend, is a dark side.

62
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:05,322
That doesn't mean you're deep. I mean,
yes, basically I'm a happy person.

63
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,075
- So am I.
- I don't see anything wrong with that.

64
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,411
No, you're too busy being happy.
Ever think about death?

65
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,747
- Yes.
- Sure you do. A fleeting thought...

66
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,292
..that drifts in and out of
the transom of your mind. I spend days.

67
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,461
And this makes you a better person?

68
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,340
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared and you're not.

69
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,803
In the meantime, you're gonna
ruin your whole life waiting for it.

70
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,063
- (Sally) You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong. He wants her to leave.

71
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,358
- That's why he puts her on the plane.
- She doesn't want to stay!

72
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,818
Of course she wants to stay!

73
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,821
Wouldn't you rather be
with Bogart than the other guy?

74
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,865
(Sally) I don't wanna spend
my life in Casablanca...

75
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,034
..married to a man who runs a bar.

76
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,662
That probably sounds snobbish
to you, but I don't.

77
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,580
You'd rather be
in a passionless marriage...

78
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,165
And First Lady of Czechoslovakia.

79
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,335
..than with the man you had
the greatest sex of your life with,...

80
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,213
..just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

81
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,756
Yes.

82
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,343
And so would any woman in
her right mind. Women are practical,...

83
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,138
..even Ingrid Bergman,
which is why she gets on the plane

84
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,557
at the end of the movie.

85
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,520
I understand.

86
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,189
- What? What?
- Nothing.

87
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,567
- What?
- Forget about it.

88
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,194
- Forget about what?
- It's not important.

89
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,405
No, just tell me.

90
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,867
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

91
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,202
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

92
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,413
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

93
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,375
Itjust so happens that
I have had plenty of good sex.

94
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,896
With whom?

95
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,733
- What?
- With whom did you have this great sex?

96
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,943
I'm not gonna tell you that!

97
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,571
Fine. Don't tell me.

98
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,246
- Shel Gordon.
- Shel. Sheldon?

99
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,750
No. No, you did not have
great sex with Sheldon.

100
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,586
- I did, too.
- No, you didn't.

101
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:29,090
A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you
need a root canal, Sheldon's your man.

102
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,427
But humpin' is not Sheldon's
strong suit. It's the name.

103
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,930
"Do it to me, Sheldon."
"You're an animal, Sheldon."

104
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,224
"Ride me, big... Sheldon."

105
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,310
- It doesn't work.
- Hi.

106
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,979
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number three.

107
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,775
The chef's salad with
the oil and vinegar on the side.

108
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,276
And the apple pie à la mode.

109
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,655
Chef and apple à la mode.

110
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,450
But I'd like the pie heated
and I want the ice cream on the side.

111
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,911
I'd like strawberry, if you have it.

112
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,288
If not, then whipped cream,
but only if it's real.

113
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,165
If it's out of a can, nothing.

114
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,294
- Not even the pie?
- No, just the pie, but then not heated.

115
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,171
Uh-huh.

116
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,637
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

117
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,184
- How come you broke up with Sheldon?
- How do you know we broke up?

118
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,814
If you didn't, you wouldn't be with me.
You'd be with Shel the Wonder Schlong.

119
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,110
First of all, I am not with you.

120
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,822
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

121
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,534
You're right, you're right.
I don't wanna know.

122
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,708
Well, it was because he was jealous and
I had these days-of-the-week underpants.

123
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,044
(imitates game-show buzzer)
Sorry, I need a judge's ruling.

124
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,714
- Days-of-the-week underpants?
- Yes.

125
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,175
They had days of the week on them
and I thought they were funny.

126
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,887
Then one day Sheldon says to me
"You never wear Sunday."

127
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,057
He's all suspicious.
Where had I left Sunday?

128
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,435
And I told him and he didn't believe me.

129
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,730
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

130
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,358
- Why not?
- Because of God.

131
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,867
OK, so 15% of my share is... 90.

132
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,870
$6.90.

133
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,958
Let's leave seven.

134
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,670
What?

135
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,383
Do I have something on my face?

136
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,678
You're a very attractive person.

137
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,931
Thank you.

138
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,267
Amanda never said
how attractive you were.

139
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,728
Maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.

140
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,024
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

141
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,403
Amanda is my friend.

142
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,946
So?

143
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,908
- So you're going with her.
- So?

144
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,285
So you're coming on to me!

145
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,413
No, I wasn't.

146
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,582
What?

147
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,920
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

148
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,463
All right, all right.

149
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:18,259
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

150
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:22,430
What d'you want me to do about it?
I take it back, OK? I take it back.

151
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,973
You can't take it back.

152
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,810
- Why not?
- Because it's already out there.

153
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,397
What are we supposed to do?
Call the cops, it's already out there!

154
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,525
Just... let it... lie.

155
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,446
- OK?
- Great! "Let it lie." That's my policy.

156
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,616
That's what I always say: "Let it lie."

157
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,493
Wanna spend the night in a motel?

158
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,662
- See? I didn't let it lie.
- Harry.

159
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,831
I said I would, then I didn't.

160
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,624
- Harry!
- What?

161
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,127
We are just going to be friends, OK?

162
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,963
Great! Friends! It's the best thing.

163
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,134
(Harry) You realize
that we could never be friends.

164
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,095
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,...

165
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,140
..and this is not a come-on
in any way, shape or form,...

166
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,933
..is that men and women
can't be friends,

167
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,686
'cause the sex part
always gets in the way.

168
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,939
That's not true.

169
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,984
I have a number of men friends
and there is no sex involved.

170
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,235
- You don't.
- I do.

171
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,611
- You don't.
- I do!

172
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,988
You only think you do.

173
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,323
I have sex with them
without my knowledge?

174
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,827
No, they all wanna have sex with you.

175
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,579
- They do not.
- Do, too.

176
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,664
- They do not.
- Do, too.

177
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,790
How do you know?

178
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,002
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

179
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,129
He always wants to have sex with her.

180
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:41,134
So you're saying a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

181
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,345
No, you pretty much
wanna nail them, too.

182
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,016
What if they don't wanna have sex?

183
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:53,730
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

184
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,232
I guess we're not
gonna be friends then.

185
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Guess not.

186
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,402
That's too bad.

187
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,530
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

206
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,777
- We fell in love in high school.
- Yeah, we were high-school sweethearts.

207
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,155
But then after ourjunior year
his parents moved away.

208
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:30,451
- But I never forgot her.
- He never forgot me.

209
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,955
No, her face was burned on my brain.

210
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,667
And it was 34 years later
that I was walking down Broadway...

211
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,961
..and I saw her come out
of Toffenetti's.

212
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,963
We both looked at each other,...

213
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,467
..and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

214
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,597
She was just as beautiful
as she was at sixteen.

215
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,974
He was just the same.

216
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,393
He looked exactly the same.

217
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,720
Joe! I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

218
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,847
- Harry Burns.
- Harry. How ya doin'?

219
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,017
- Good. How you doin'?
- Fine. I'm doin' fine.

220
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,519
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

221
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,229
Yeah, it was.

222
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:44,484
- You still with the DA's office?
- No, I switched to the other side. You?

223
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:49,072
I work with a small firm. We do
political consulting. Yeah, it's great.

224
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,034
Oh, Harry, this is Sally Albright.
Harry Burns.

225
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,038
Uh, Harry and I, we used to...
We lived in the same building.

226
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,248
(both laugh)

227
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,712
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was good to see you, Joe. Bye.

228
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,264
Thank God he couldn't place me. I drove
to New York with him five years ago...

229
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,518
..and it was the
longest night of my life.

230
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,897
- What happened?
- He made a pass at me. When I said no:

231
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,192
..he was going with
a girlfriend of mine, uh...

232
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,071
Oh, God. I can't remember her name.

233
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,531
Don't get involved with me.

234
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,283
I am 26 and can't remember
the name of the girl...

235
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,743
..I was such good friends with

236
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,495
I wouldn't get involved
with her boyfriend.

237
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,373
- So what happened?
- When?

238
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,668
- When he made a pass, you said no...
- Oh, oh.

239
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,421
I said we could just be friends.

240
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:51,968
And this part I remember. He said men
and women could never really be friends.

241
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,429
Do you think that's true?

242
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,431
No.

243
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,434
Do you have any women friends,
just friends?

244
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,561
No.

245
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,772
But I will get one
if it's important to you.

246
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,651
Amanda Reese!

247
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,112
That was her name. Thank God.

248
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,949
I will miss you. I love you.

249
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,953
- You do?
- Yes.

250
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,290
I love you.

251
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,274
- What would you like to drink?
- Nothing, thanks.

252
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,359
- D'you have any Bloody Mary mix?
- Yes.

253
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,237
No, wait. Here's what I want.

254
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,782
Regular tomato juice,
fill it up three quarters,...

255
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,284
..then add a splash of Bloody Mary mix,
just a splash,

256
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,495
and some lime on the side.

257
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,164
The University of Chicago, right?

258
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,041
Yes.

259
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,585
Did you look this good
at the university?

260
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,171
- No.
- Did we ever...?

261
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,381
No. No!

262
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:17,178
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

263
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,932
- Would you two like to sit together?
- Great! Thank you.

264
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,398
You were a good friend of, um...

265
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,569
Amanda's. I can't believe
you can't remember her name.

266
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,197
What do you mean?
I can remember. Amanda Rice.

267
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,033
- Reese.
- Reese, right. What happened to her?

268
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,869
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?!

269
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,706
You were friends. We didn't make it
because you were such good friends.

270
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,667
- You went with her!
- Was it worth it?

271
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,044
The sacrifice, for a friend
you no longer see?

272
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,713
Harry, you might not believe this,...

273
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,717
..but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

274
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,887
Fair enough. Fair enough.

275
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,226
- You wanted to be a gymnast.
- Journalist.

276
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,063
- That's what I said. And?
- I am a journalist. I work at The News.

277
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,482
Great. And you're with Joe.

278
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,402
Well, that's great. Great.

279
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,446
You're together, what, three weeks?

280
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,450
- A month. How did you know?
- You take someone to the airport,...

281
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,119
..it's the beginning of a relationship.

282
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,290
That is why I never
do that at the beginning.

283
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,209
- Why?
- Because eventually things move on...

284
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,546
..and you don't take someone.
I never wanted anyone to say...

285
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,090
.."How come you never take me
to the airport anymore?"

286
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:42,263
It's amazing. You look normal,
but actually you are the Angel of Death.

287
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,640
Are you gonna marry him?

288
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:50,438
We have known each other a month and
neither of us wants to marry right now.

289
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,689
I'm getting married.

290
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,609
- You are?
- Mm-hm.

291
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,028
- You are?
- Yeah.

292
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,949
- Who is she?
- Helen Hillson. She's keeping her name.

293
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,661
- You're getting married.
- Yeah.

294
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,082
- What's so funny about that?
- (mumbles and giggles)

295
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,003
It's just... It's just
so optimistic of you, Harry.

296
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,089
You'd be amazed what
falling madly in love can do for you.

297
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,635
Well, it's wonderful.
It's nice to see you embracing life.

298
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,805
Yeah. Plus, you get to a certain point
where you get tired of the whole thing.

299
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,307
What whole thing?

300
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,476
The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

301
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,813
You meet someone, you have the safe
lunch, you decide to move on to dinner.

302
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,317
You go dancing,
you do the white man's overbite,...

303
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,402
..go back to her place, have sex,

304
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,863
and then you know
what goes through your mind?

305
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,575
"How long do I have to lie here
and hold her before I can go home?"

306
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,786
"Is 30 seconds enough?"

307
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,705
That's what you're thinking?
Is that true?

308
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,250
Sure. All men think that.

309
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,628
How long do you like to be
held afterwards? All night, right?

310
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,879
That's the problem.

311
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,174
Somewhere between 30 seconds
and all night is your problem.

312
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,843
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

313
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,361
- Staying over?
- Yes.

314
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,115
Would you like to have dinner?
Just friends.

315
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,701
You don't believe
men and women can be friends.

316
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,078
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

317
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,539
No, no, no, no, I never said that.

318
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,876
Yes, that's right.
They can't be friends.

319
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:40,589
Unless both are involved with someone.
Then they can. I amend the earlier rule.

320
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,216
If two people are in relationships,

321
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,511
the pressure of possible involvement
is lifted.

322
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,432
That doesn't work either.
The person you're with can't see...

323
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,059
..why you need to be friends
with the person,...

324
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,688
..like it means something
is missing from the relationship.

325
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,567
Then when you say "No, nothing
is missing," the person you're with...

326
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,654
..accuses you of being attracted to
the person you're just friends with,...

327
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,574
..which you probably are.
I mean, let's face it.

328
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,076
So we're back to the rule
before the amendment:

329
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,954
..men and women can't be friends.
Where's it leave us?

330
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,539
- Harry.
- What?

331
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,790
Goodbye.

332
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,084
OK.

333
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,428
I'll just stop walking.
I'll let you go ahead.

334
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,476
We were married 40 years ago.

335
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,313
We were married three years, we got
a divorce. Then I married Marjorie.

336
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,982
- First you lived with Barbara.
- Right, Barbara.

337
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,651
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

338
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,988
- Then you got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

339
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,782
Another divorce.

340
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:52,828
Then a couple of years later at Eddie
Collecio's funeral, I ran into her.

341
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,664
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

342
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,542
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

343
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,128
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

344
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,507
I remember I snuck over to her
and I said...

345
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,802
- What did I say?
- You said "What are you doin' after?"

346
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:12,473
Right. So I ditch Roberta, we go
for coffee, a month later we're married.

347
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,810
35 years to the day
after our first marriage.

348
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,233
- I went through his pockets.
- Marie, why?

349
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,276
- You know what I found?
- No, what?

350
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:29,323
They just bought a dining-room table.
His wife just spent $1 ,600 on a table.

351
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,201
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

352
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,495
The point is he's never gonna leave her.

353
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,164
What else is new?
You've known this for two years.

354
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,834
You're right. I know you're right.

355
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,335
Can't you find someone single?

356
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,546
When I was single
I knew lots of nice single men.

357
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,841
There must be someone.
Sally found someone.

358
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,218
(Marie) Sally got the last good one.

359
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,220
- Joe and I broke up.
- What?

360
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,930
- When?
- Monday.

361
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,266
- You waited three days?
- Joe's available?

362
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:59,687
For God's sake, Marie, don't you
have feelings? She's obviously upset.

363
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,815
I'm not that upset.
We'd been growing apart for a while.

364
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,358
But you were a couple.

365
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,237
You had someone to go places with.
You had a date on national holidays!

366
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:12,032
I said to myself "You deserve
more than this. You're 31 ..."

367
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,367
And the clock is ticking.

368
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,537
No, it doesn't start
to tick until you're 36.

369
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,998
God, you're in such great shape.

370
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:23,252
Well, I've had a few days
to get used to it, and I feel OK.

371
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,671
Good. Then you're ready.

372
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,217
- Really, Marie!
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

373
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:34,054
I've got the perfect guy. I don't
find him attractive, but you might.

374
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,265
She doesn't have a problem with chins.

375
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,186
- Marie, I'm not ready yet.
- But you just said you were over him.

376
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,814
I am over him,
but I'm in a mourning period.

377
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,777
- Who is it?
- Alex Anderson.

378
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,070
Oh!

379
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,740
You fixed me up with him six years ago.

380
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,367
Sorry. God.

381
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,953
All right, wait. Here. Here we go.

382
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:01,707
- Ken Darman.
- He's been married for over a year.

383
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,084
Really?

384
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,253
Married.

385
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,464
- Oh, wait. Wait, I got one.
- Look,...

386
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,425
..there is no point going out
with someone I might like

387
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,093
if I met him at the right time,...

388
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,931
..but who right now would
just be a transitional man.

389
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:21,727
OK, but don't wait too long. Remember
what happened with David Warsaw?

390
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,604
His wife left him and everyone said

391
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,398
"Give him some time.
Don't move in too fast."

392
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,151
Six months later he was dead.

393
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,072
Are you saying I should marry quickly
in case he's about to die?

394
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,282
At least you could say you were married.

395
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,619
I'm saying that the right man
is out there.

396
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,080
If you don't grab him,
someone else will,...

397
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,624
..and you'll spend your life
knowing that someone else

398
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,793
is married to your husband.

399
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,466
Ten! Hut!

400
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,979
(cheering)

401
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,818
- When did this happen?
- Friday. Helen comes home from work...

402
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,363
..and she says "I don't know
if I wanna be married any more."

403
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,781
Like it's the institution.

404
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:20,035
Nothing personal, just something
she's been thinking about.

405
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,539
I'm calm. I say "Why don't we
take time to think about it?

406
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,833
- Don't rush into anything."
- Yeah, right.

407
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,168
Next day she says
she's thought about it.

408
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,589
She wants a trial separation.
She just wants to try it.

409
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,050
But we can still date - like this
is supposed to cushion the blow.

410
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,844
I got married so I could stop dating,

411
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,346
so still dating
is not a big incentive...

412
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:43,183
..since the last thing you wanna do
is date your wife, who should love you.

413
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,937
Which is what I'm saying to her,
when it occurs to me maybe she doesn't.

414
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,857
So I say to her
"Don't you love me anymore?"

415
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,235
D'you know what she says?
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

416
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,615
Oooh! That's harsh. You don't
bounce back from that right away.

417
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,743
- Thanks, Jess.
- No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.

418
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,536
That's particularly harsh.

419
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,914
Then she says someone in her office
is going to South America...

420
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,708
..and she can sublet his apartment.

421
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,628
I can't believe this.
And the doorbell rings.

422
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,339
"I can sublet his apartment" -
the words still hang in the air

423
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,591
like in a balloon...

424
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,051
- Like a cartoon.
- Right.

425
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,012
So I go to the door and
there are moving men there.

426
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,056
Now I start to get suspicious.

427
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,934
I say "Helen, when did you call
these movers?" She doesn't say anything.

428
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,896
So I ask the movers
"When did this woman book you?"

429
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,898
And they're three huge guys.

430
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,234
One with a T-shirt saying
"Don't fuck with Mr. Zero."

431
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:39,782
So I said "Helen, when did you make this
arrangement?" She says "A week ago."

432
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,118
I said "You've known for a week
and you didn't tell me?"

433
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,747
And she says
"I didn't wanna ruin your birthday."

434
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,086
Mr. Zero knew you were getting
a divorce a week before you?

435
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,171
- Mr. Zero knew.
- I can't believe this!

436
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,676
- I haven't told you the bad part yet.
- What's worse than Mr. Zero knowing?

437
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,928
It's all a lie.

438
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,599
She's in love with somebody else.
Some tax attorney.

439
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,477
- She moved in with him.
- How did you find out?

440
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,147
I followed her.
Stood outside the building.

441
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,109
- That's so humiliating!
- Tell me about it.

442
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,819
And, you know, I knew.

443
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,655
I knew that even though we were happy,
it was an illusion.

444
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,324
And that one day
she'd kick the shit outta me.

445
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,369
Marriages don't break up
due to infidelity.

446
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,788
It's a symptom something else is wrong.

447
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,208
Oh, really?
Well, that symptom is fucking my wife!

448
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,841
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

449
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,136
What do you mean
"just happened" to see it?

450
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,140
Well, he was shaving,
and there it was in his briefcase.

451
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,851
What if he came out and saw you?

452
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,854
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

453
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:57,276
He just spent $120
on a new nightgown for his wife.

454
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,362
I don't think he's
ever gonna leave her.

455
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,157
No one thinks he's
ever gonna leave her.

456
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,993
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

457
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,345
Someone is staring at you
in Personal Growth.

458
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,894
I know him. You'd like him.
He's married.

459
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,520
Who is he?

460
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,315
Harry Burns.
He's a political consultant.

461
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,358
He's cute.

462
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,695
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

463
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,822
Last time I saw him
he was getting married.

464
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,201
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

465
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,370
So he might not be married anymore.

466
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,830
Also, he's obnoxious.

467
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:56,794
It's like in The Lady Vanishes, when she
says "You're the most obnoxious man",...

468
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,047
- "The most contemptible".
- ..then they fall madly in love.

469
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,716
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

470
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,638
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

471
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,474
It is. This is Marie.

472
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,727
Was Marie.

473
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,896
- How are you?
- Fine.

474
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,857
- How's Joe?
- Fine.

475
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,068
I hear he's fine.

476
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,613
- You're not with Joe anymore?
- We just broke up.

477
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:28,408
Oh... I'm sorry. That's too bad.

478
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,745
Yeah. Well, you know.

479
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,288
Yeah.

480
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,457
So...

481
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,584
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

482
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,878
How's married life?

483
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,924
Not so good.
I'm getting a divorce.

484
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,970
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm really sorry.

485
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,431
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

486
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,141
What happened with you guys?

487
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,104
When Joe and I started seeing each other
we wanted the same thing.

488
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:01,984
We didn't wanna get married because
every time anyone we knew got married...

489
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,863
..it ruined their relationship.
They practically never had sex again.

490
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,908
It's true. That's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

491
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,786
I would sit with my girlfriends
who have kids...

492
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,622
my one girlfriend with kids, Alice,...

493
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,960
..and she would complain about
how she and Gary never did it anymore.

494
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,463
She didn't even complain about it.
She said it matter-of-factly.

495
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,134
She said they were up all night,
they were both exhausted,...

496
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,013
..the kids took every sexual impulse
they had out of them.

497
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:37,352
Joe and I would say "We're so lucky.
We have this wonderful relationship."

498
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,646
"We can have sex on the kitchen floor

499
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,773
and not worry
about the kids walking in."

500
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:45,819
"We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

501
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,032
Then one day I was taking
Alice's girl for the afternoon...

502
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,076
..'cause I promised to
take her to the circus.

503
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,787
We were in the cab playing I-spy.

504
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,665
"I spy a mailbox," "I spy a lamppost."

505
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,711
And she looked out the window
and she saw this man and woman...

506
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,004
..with these two little kids,

507
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,257
and the man had one of the kids
on his shoulders.

508
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,802
And she said "I spy a family."

509
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:16,516
And I started to cry.
You know, I just started crying.

510
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,520
And I went home and I said
"The thing is, Joe,...

511
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,815
..we never do fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

512
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,859
And the kitchen floor...?

513
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:31,073
Not once. It's this very cold, hard,
Mexican ceramic tile.

514
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,824
Oh.

515
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,952
Anyway,...

516
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,703
..we talked about it for a long time.

517
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,415
I said "This is what I want"
and he said "I don't."

518
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,044
And I said "Well, I guess it's over."
And he left.

519
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,759
And the thing is, I...
I feel really fine.

520
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,179
I am over him.
I mean, I really am over him.

521
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,474
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

522
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,892
And every time I think about it,

523
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,062
I am more and more convinced
I did the right thing.

524
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,690
Boy, you sound really healthy.

525
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,942
Yeah.

526
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,737
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me.

527
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,407
But really, what's so hard
about finding an apartment?

528
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,701
You read the obituary column.

529
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:19,413
You find out who died, go to the
building, and then you tip the doorman.

530
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,667
It'd be easier if they combined
obituaries with the real-estate section.

531
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,087
Then you have "Mr. Klein died,
leaving a wife, two children...

532
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:32,134
..and a spacious three-bedroom apartment
with a wood-burning fireplace."

533
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,431
The first time we met
I really didn't like you that much.

534
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,433
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

535
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,936
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

536
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:47,107
I hate that kind of remark. It sounds
like a compliment, but it's an insult.

537
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,359
OK, you're still as hard as nails.

538
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,946
I didn't wanna sleep with you so you
wrote it off as a character flaw,...

539
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,865
..instead of dealing
with the possibility

540
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,325
it might have something to do with you.

541
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,330
What's the statute of limitations
on apologies?

542
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,166
Ten years.

543
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,127
Ooh, I can just get it in
under the wire.

544
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,634
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

545
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,596
Are we becoming friends now?

546
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,849
Well...

547
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,310
Yeah.

548
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,647
Great! A woman friend.

549
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,358
You may be the first attractive woman

550
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,820
I've not wanted to sleep with
in my entire life.

551
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,323
That's wonderful, Harry.

552
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,702
- We were born in the same hospital,...
- In 1921 .

553
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,371
- ..seven days apart.
- In the same hospital.

554
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,666
- We both grew up one block apart.
- We lived in tenements.

555
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,669
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

556
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,839
- I moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

557
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,967
- She moved when she was 1 1 .
- I lived on 183rd Street.

558
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,428
She worked on the 15th floor
as a nurse.

559
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,348
I worked for a prominent neurologist,...

560
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,518
- I had a practice on the 14th floor.
- ..Dr. Permelman.

561
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,020
- We never met.
- Never met.

562
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,816
- Can you imagine that?
- D'you know where we met? An elevator.

563
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,819
- I was visiting family.
- In the Ambassador Hotel.

564
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,571
He was on the third floor,
I was on the 12th.

565
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,367
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

566
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,036
Nine extra floors.

567
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,710
(phone rings)

568
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,715
- (Sally) Hello.
- (Harry) You sleeping?

569
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,593
- No, I was watching "Casablanca."
- Channel?

570
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,555
- Eleven.
- Thank you. Got it.

571
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,684
So you'd be happier with Victor Laszlo
than with Humphrey Bogart?

572
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,895
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

573
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:53,567
- I never said that. I'd never say that.
- All right, fine. Have it your way.

574
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,445
- (Harry) Have you been sleeping?
- Why?

575
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:01,575
'Cause I haven't been sleeping.
I really miss Helen.

576
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:08,206
Maybe I'm coming down with something. I
watched "Leave It to Beaver" in Spanish.

577
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:12,169
"Buenos días, Señor Cleaver.
¿Dónde están Wallace y Theodore?"

578
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,545
I'm not well.

579
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,591
(Sally) I went to bed at 7:30.
I haven't done that since third grade.

580
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,760
(Harry) That's the good thing
about depression - you rest.

581
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,972
- (Sally) I'm not depressed.
- OK. Fine.

582
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,975
(Harry) Do you still sleep
on the same side ofthe bed?

583
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,686
I did for a while,
but now I'm using the whole bed.

584
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:34,858
God, that's great. I feel weird
when just my leg wanders over.

585
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,360
I miss her.

586
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,448
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

587
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,617
You know what I miss?

588
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,119
I miss the idea of him.

589
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,290
Maybe I only miss the idea of Helen.

590
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,585
No, I miss the whole Helen.

591
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,465
(Sally gasps) Last scene.

592
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,138
Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

593
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,475
(Harry) Ooh, Ingrid Bergman.
She's low maintenance.

594
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,186
- Low maintenance?
- There are two kinds ofwomen.

595
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:15,649
- High maintenance and low maintenance.
- And Ingrid is low maintenance?

596
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,651
An LM, definitely.

597
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,819
- Which one am I?
- The worst kind.

598
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,781
You're high maintenance,
but you think you're low.

599
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,033
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

600
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,286
"Waiter, a house salad,
but not the regular dressing."

601
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,830
"I'll have balsamic vinegar -
on the side."

602
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,334
"Then salmon with mustard sauce,
but I want the sauce on the side."

603
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,338
- "On the side" is a big thing for you.
- I just want it the way I want it.

604
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,507
I know. High maintenance.

605
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,718
..10,000 franks should pay our expenses.

606
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,887
- Our expenses?
- Mm-hm.

607
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:50,517
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

608
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,188
(Harry) Ooh, best last line
of a movie ever.

609
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,857
(Sally sighs dreamily)

610
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:02,529
I'm definitely coming down with
something. Probably a 24-hour tumor.

611
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,781
- You don't have a tumor.
- How do you know?

612
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:09,953
- If you're so worried, go see a doctor.
- No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

613
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,622
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be OK.

614
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,042
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

615
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:21,214
Maybe I should practice now.
Mmm. Mmm.

616
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,259
Mmm. Mmm.

617
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,928
- Good night, Harry.
- Mmm.

618
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,222
Good night.

619
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,730
(carries on moaning softly)

620
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,803
I had my dream again - where I'm making
love and Olympicjudges are watching?

621
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,806
I'd nailed the compulsories,
so this is it: the finals.

622
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,435
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American,...

623
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,105
..and my mother, disguised as
an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

624
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,483
Must've been the dismount.

625
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,819
(Sally) Basically it's the same one
I've had since I was 12.

626
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,697
- What happens?
- No, it's... It's too embarrassing.

627
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,200
- Don't tell me.
- OK, there's this guy.

628
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,868
What's he look like?

629
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,995
I don't know.
He's just kinda faceless.

630
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,457
A faceless guy. OK. Then what happens?

631
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,626
He rips off my clothes.

632
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,880
- Then what happens?
- That's it.

633
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,509
That's it? A faceless guy
rips off your clothes.

634
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:51,930
And that's the sex fantasy you've had
since you were 12. Exactly the same?

635
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,808
Well, sometimes I vary it a little.

636
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,477
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

637
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,984
- What?
- Nothing.

638
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,365
(Harry in silly accent)
I have decided that for today...

639
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,159
..we are going to talk like this.

640
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,496
- (Sally tries to imitate) Like this?
- No. To repeat after me.

641
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,705
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

642
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:18,832
- Pepper.
- Pepper!

643
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,791
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

644
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,583
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

645
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:25,004
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

646
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:30,009
(both) Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

647
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,430
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

648
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,223
(laughs) Oh, no!

649
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,392
- But I would be proud.
- But I would be proud.

650
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,685
- To partake.
- To partake.

651
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,855
- Of your pecan pie.
- Of your pecan pie.

652
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,565
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

653
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:47,360
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie! (giggles)

654
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,030
- Would you like to go to the movies?
- Would you like to go...

655
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:57,120
Not to repeat. Please, to answer. Would
you like to go to the movies tonight?

656
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:01,332
Oh... Oh...
Well, I'd love to, Harry, but I can't.

657
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,544
What do you have? A hot date?

658
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,213
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

659
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,507
Yeah. I was gonna tell you,
but, I don't know,

660
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,051
- I felt strange about it.
- Why?

661
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,262
'Cause we've spent
so much time together.

662
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,056
I think it's great that you have a date.

663
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,267
- You do?
- Yeah.

664
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,651
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

665
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,946
Well... I don't know. Why?

666
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,992
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

667
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,786
- I do?
- Yeah.

668
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:45,335
I think hieroglyphics are really a comic
strip about a character named Sphinxy.

669
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,088
- Harry, you should get out there, too.
- (accent) Oh, I'm not ready.

670
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,717
- You should.
- I would not be good for anybody now.

671
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,594
It's time.

672
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,097
It was the most
uncomfortable night of my life.

673
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,308
See, no, it has to go this way.

674
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,187
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

675
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,356
You only had one date.

676
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,943
- How do you know it won't get worse?
- How much worse can it get...

677
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:15,615
..than finishing dinner, having him pull
a hair out of my head and floss with it?

678
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,618
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

679
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,288
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

680
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,125
And we're talking in this Ethiopian
restaurant she wanted to go to.

681
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,629
I was making jokes, like "I didn't
know they had food in Ethiopia."

682
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,508
"This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

683
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,969
Yeah! Nothing from her,
not even a smile.

684
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,305
I downshift into small talk
and ask where she went to school.

685
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,725
She says Michigan State.
And this reminds me of Helen.

686
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,020
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of an anxiety attack -

687
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,148
..my heart's beatin' fast
and I start sweatin' like a pig.

688
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,277
- Helen went to Michigan State?
- No, Northwestern.

689
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,654
But they're both Big Ten schools.

690
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,907
I got so upset
I had to leave the restaurant.

691
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,245
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

692
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:06,666
It might be months before we're able
to enjoy going out with someone new.

693
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,750
Yeah.

694
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,170
Maybe longer before we're able
to go to bed with someone new.

695
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,715
Oh, I went to bed with her.

696
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,885
- You went to bed with her?!
- Sure.

697
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,804
Oh.

698
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,853
- I don't understand this relationship.
- What d'ya mean?

699
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,688
- Enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

700
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,857
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

701
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,192
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

702
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,528
You're afraid to let yourself be happy.

703
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,073
Why can't you gimme credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

704
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:43,077
I never had a relationship with a woman
that didn't involve sex. I'm growing.

705
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,954
Are you finished?

706
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,873
I got a stack o' quarters.
I was here first.

707
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,082
- Were not.
- Was too.

708
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,917
- Were not!
- Was too!

709
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,629
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

710
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,714
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

711
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,382
Yeah.

712
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,802
It's very freeing.
I can say anything to her.

713
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,723
Are you saying you can say things to her
you can't say to me?

714
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,392
No, it's just a different perspective.

715
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,686
I get the woman's
point of view on things.

716
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,565
She tells me about the men she sees,
and I talk to her about the women I see.

717
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,859
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

718
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,613
Like the other night, I made love
to this woman and it was incredible.

719
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,492
I took her to a place that wasn't human.
She actually meowed.

720
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,785
You made a woman meow?

721
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,121
Yeah, and I can say
these things to her.

722
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,289
And the great thing is,

723
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,668
I don't have to lie because
I don't wanna get her into bed.

724
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,922
- I can just be myself.
- You made a woman meow?

725
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,926
What do you do with these women?
Just get up and leave?

726
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,094
Sure.

727
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,471
Explain how you do it.
What do you say?

728
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,182
I say I have an early meeting,
early squash game.

729
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,308
You don't play squash.

730
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,103
They don't know that.
They just met me.

731
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,231
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

732
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,942
I'm so glad I never
got involved with you.

733
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,071
I just would've been some woman you
had to get outta bed and leave at 3am...

734
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,449
..and go clean your andirons.
You don't even have a fireplace.

735
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,909
Not that I would know this.

736
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,412
Why are you upset?
This isn't about you.

737
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,749
Yes, it is! You are a human affront
to all women, and I am a woman.

738
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,669
Hey, I don't hear anyone complaining.

739
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,255
Of course not.
You're out the door too fast.

740
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:21,259
- I think they have an OK time.
- How do you know?

741
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,137
What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.

742
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:28,141
- Because they...
- Yes, because they...

743
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:33,855
- How do you know that they're really...
- What're you saying? They fake orgasm?

744
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,649
- It's possible.
- Get outta here!

745
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,902
Why? Most women
at one time or another have faked it.

746
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,239
- They haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

747
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,117
Because I know.

748
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,747
Oh. Right. That's right.

749
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,166
I forgot. You're a man.

750
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,543
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

751
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,422
All men are sure it never happened
to them and most women have done it,...

752
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,840
..so you do the math.

753
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,343
You don't think I
could tell the difference?

754
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,346
- No.
- Get outta here.

755
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,937
Ooh.

756
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,441
(moans) Oh.

757
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,194
Ooh.

758
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,362
Are you OK?

759
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,407
Ohhh...

760
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,368
Oh, God.

761
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,205
Ooh! Oh, God.

762
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,166
Oh.

763
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,210
Ah.

764
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,420
Oh...

765
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,215
Oh, God.

766
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,050
Oh, yeah, right there.

767
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,219
(short gasps)

768
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:50,515
Oh... Oh... Oh...

769
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,809
Oh, God. Oh...

Yes! Ah! Oh!

773
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:05,780
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes! Oh!

774
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,825
Yes! Yes! Yes!

775
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,410
Yes! Yes! Yes!

776

Oh! Oh... Oh...

Oh, God.

778
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,293
Oh.

779
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,011

00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,615
..and they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

826
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,785
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine,...

827
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,622
..'cause people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

828
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,625
But he was coming to talk to me,
and he said...

829
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,754
"I'm Ben Small
of the Coney Island Smalls."

830
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:54,425
At that moment I knew. I knew
the way you know about a good melon.

831
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,971
You sent flowers to yourself.

832
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,892
$60 I spent on this big arrangement
of flowers, and I wrote a card...

833
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,518
..that I planned to leave on the table

834
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,146
where Arthur would
just happen to see it.

835
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,565
What did the card say?

836
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,318
"Please say yes. Love Jonathan."

837
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,570
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

838
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,824
He forgot a charity thing his wife is
chairman of. He's never gonna leave her!

839
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,328
- Of course he isn't.
- You're right. I know you're right.

840
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,331
- Where is this place?
- Somewhere on the next block.

841
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh! I can't believe I'm doing this.

842
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,670
Harry is one of my best friends
and you are one of my best friends.

843
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,672
And if you two hit it off,

844
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,175
we could still be friends,
instead of drifting apart...

845
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,386
..like you do when you date someone
who doesn't know your friends.

846
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:43,557
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

847
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:47,353
IfArthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him,...

848
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,940
..I am sure that
you and I would drift apart.

849
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,192
He's never gonna leave her.

850
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,361
Of course he isn't.

851
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,696
You're right. I know you're right.

852
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,407
- I dunno about this.
- It's just a dinner.

853
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:05,704
I've finally gotten to a place where I'm
comfortable with just me and my work.

854
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,373
If she's so great
why don't you date her?

855
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,625
I told you. We're just friends.

856
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,586
- So she's not attractive?
- No, she is attractive.

857
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:17,383
- You said she had a good personality.
- She has a good personality.

858
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,386
What?

859
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:24,765
When someone's not attractive, they're
described as having a good personality.

860
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,727
If you'd asked about looks and I'd
said "She has a good personality",...

861
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,604
..she's not attractive.

862
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,275
But because I mentioned she has
a good personality, she can be either.

863
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:38,237
Attractive with a good personality, or
not attractive with a good personality.

864
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,406
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

865
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,867
But not beautiful, right?

866
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,663
It's like,
whenever I read Jimmy Breslin,

867
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,499
it's as if he's leaving
a wake-up call...

868
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:54,753
- ..for the City of New York.
- What d'you mean by a "wake-up call"?

869
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:59,258
He's saying that we've got people
in the city who are on welfare...

870
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,595
Would I have seen any of your windows?

871
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:07,224
A couple of weeks ago
I did a thing with hostages.

872
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,268
- The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

873
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,938
- I thought it was like late '80s.
- Uh-huh.

874
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,940
That's interesting.

875
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,068
Let's just say I'm not
a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

876
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:22,781
Well, he's the reason I became a writer,
but that's not important.

877
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,131
Harry, you and Marie
are both from New Jersey.

878
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,799
- Really?
- Where?

879
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,509
- South Orange.
- Haddonfield.

880
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,553
Oh!

881
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,144
So, what are we gonna order?

882
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,647
I'm gonna start with
the grilled radicchio.

883
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:58,192
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.
Not only does she pick the best,...

884
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,695
..but she orders it in a way even the
chef didn't know how good it could be.

885
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:05,199
- Restaurants have become too important.
- Oh, I agree.

886
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:09,662
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theatre was to people in the '60s."

887
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,664
I read that in a magazine.

888
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,375
I wrote that.

889
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,169
- Get outta here.
- No, I did! I wrote that.

890
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,714
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine. That's amazing.

891
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,425
Don't you think that's amazing?
And you wrote it?

892
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,012
I also wrote
"Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."

893
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,890
- Get over yourself!
- I did!

894
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,685
- Where did I read that?
- New York Magazine.

895
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,187
Sally writes for New York Magazine.

896
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,856
You know, that piece
had a real impact on me.

897
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,733
I don't know much about writing...

898
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,236
It spoke to you, and that pleases me.

899
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:45,698
I mean, you have to admire people
who can be that articulate.

900
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,535
Nobody has ever quoted
me back to me before.

901
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:02,298
Oh! I've been looking for
a red suede pump.

902
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,219
What do you think of Jess?

903
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,263
Well, uh...

904
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,557
Do you think you
could go out with him?

905
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,392
I don't know...

906
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,186
'Cause I feel really
comfortable with him.

907
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:19,565
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

908
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,651
Sure. Sure.
I'm just worried about Harry.

909
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,279
He's sensitive,
he's going through a rough period,

910
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,906
and I don't want you to reject him.

911
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,284
I wouldn't. I totally understand.

912
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,912
If you don't think you're gonna
call Marie, do you mind if I call her?

913
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,706
- No, no.
- Good. Good.

914
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:40,002
But for tonight you shouldn't. I mean,
Sally's very vulnerable right now.

915
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,131
You can call Marie, but wait a week
or so. Don't make any moves tonight.

916
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,968
Fine. No problem.
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

917
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,222
Well, I don't feel like walking
anymore. I think I'll get a cab.

918
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,476
- I'll go with you.
- Great! Taxi!

919
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:12,659
A man came to me and said
"I found nice girl for you."

920
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:16,955
"She lives in the next village...

921
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,459
..and she is ready for marriage."

922
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,839
We were not supposed to meet
until the wedding,...

923
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,050
..but I wanted to make sure.

924
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,513
So I sneak into her village,
hid behind a tree,...

925
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,474
..watch her washing the clothes.

926
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:41,980
I think if I don't like the way
she looks, I don't marry her.

927
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,983
But she looked very nice to me.

928
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:48,237
So I said "OK" to the man.

929
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,739
We get married.

930
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,992
We married for 55 years.

931
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,294
- I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

932
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:08,298
- We'll find something. Great stuff.
- Should have gone to the plant store.

933
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,677
- Here. Perfect for them.
- What's that?

934
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,513
Battery-operated pith helmet, with fan.

935
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,516
- Why is this necessary in life?
- I don't know.

936
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,727
Look at this. Also makes great fries.

937
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,773
Oh, oh-oh. Good.
Call off the dogs. The hunt is over.

938
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,818
Sally, this is the greatest.

939
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,237
Sally, please report to me.

940
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,157
Look. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

941
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:38,579
This is a singing machine. Look, you
sing the lead and this has the backup.

942
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,832
- This is from Oklahoma!
- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top."

943
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,710
Yes, perfect. Ooh!

It's my voice, isn't it?
You hate my voice.

957
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,792
- I know, it's terrible. Joe hated it...
- It's Helen.

958
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,878
Helen?

959
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,755
She's coming right towards me.

960
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:41,808
- How are you, Harry?
- Fine. I'm fine.

961
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,313
This is Ira Stone. Harry Burns.

962
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,357
Harry.

963
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,781
I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright.
Helen Hillson...

964
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,824
..and Ira.

965
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,826
Sally.

966
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:03,163
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

967
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,292
Well...

968
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:11,421
- See you.
- Yeah. Bye.

969
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,217
Nice to meet you... Ira.

970
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,432
You OK?

971
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,103
Yeah, I'm perfect.

972
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,606
She looked weird, didn't she?
She looked really weird.

973
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,485
- I've never seen her before.
- Trust me. Her legs looked heavy.

974
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,445
- Must be retaining water.
- Harry!

975
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,365
Believe me, the woman saved everything.

976
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,453
Sure you're OK?

977
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:46,540
Oh, I'm fine.
Look, it had to happen at some point.

978
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,293
In a city of eight million,
you're bound to run into your ex-wife.

979
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,836
So it happened.

980
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,088
And now I'm fine.

981
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,802
I like it. It works.
It says "home" to me.

982
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,848
All right. All right.
We'll let Harry and Sally be the judge.

983
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,892
What do you think?

984
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,936
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

985
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,522
Of course he likes it - he's a guy.

986
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,774
Sally?

987
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,861
What's so awful about it?

988
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,948
It's so awful, there's no way to begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

989
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,492
Honey, I don't object to your things.

990
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,246
Ifwe had room, you could put your
things in it, like your bar stools...

991
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,375
Honey, wait, wait. Honey, wait.
You don't like my bar stools?

992
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,795
Harry, come on,
someone has to be on my side.

993
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,757
I'm on your side.
I just want you to have good taste.

994
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,134
I have good taste!

995
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:44,264
Everybody thinks they have good taste,
but they couldn't all have good taste.

996
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:48,268
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

997
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:52,856
We hung things, we picked out tiles
together. Then you know what happens?

998
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:58,528
Six years later you're singing "Surrey
with the Fringe on Top" in front of lra!

999
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,572
Do we have to talk
about this right now?

1000
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,492
Yes. Right now is the perfect time,...

1001
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,663
..because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

1002
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,081
Right now everything is great.

1003
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:12,376
Everyone is happy and in love,
and that's wonderful.

1004
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,879
But sooner or later,
you'll be screaming at each other

1005
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,839
about who'll get this dish.

1006
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,967
This $8 dish will cost $1 ,000 in calls

1007
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,095
to the legal firm of
"That's mine, this is yours."

1008
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,138
- Harry!
- Please.

1009
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:28,475
Jess, Marie,
do me a favor for your own good.

1010
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:32,938
Put your name in your books right now
before you don't know whose is whose,...

1011
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:38,110
..because some day you'll go 15 rounds
over who's gonna get this coffee table.

1012
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:43,949
This stupid, wagon-wheel,
Roy-Rogers, garage-sale coffee table!

1013
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,454
- I thought you liked it.
- I was being nice!

1014
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,166
(door slams)

1015
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,877
He just bumped into Helen.

1016
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,304
I want you to know...

1017
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:10,642
..that I will never want
that wagon-wheel coffee table.

1018
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,318
- (sighs)
- I know, I know,

1019
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,320
I shouldn't have done it.

1020
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,406
Harry, you have to try to find a way

1021
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,284
of not expressing
every feeling you have,...

1022
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,453
..every moment that you have them.

1023
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,122
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1024
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,000
There are times and places for things.

1025
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,336
Well, the next time you're giving
a lecture on social graces,

1026
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,922
tell me 'cause I'll sign up.

1027
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:44,676
Hey! You don't have
to take your anger out on me.

1028
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:48,221
I'm entitled to throw anger your way.
Especially when I'm being told

1029
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,849
how to live my life
by Miss Hospital Corners!

1030
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,811
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing bothers you!

1031
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:58,648
- You never get upset about anything!
- Don't be ridiculous!

1032
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,066
What?

1033
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,735
You never get upset about Joe.

1034
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,529
I never see it back up on you.
How is it possible?

1035
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:08,700
- Don't you experience feelings of loss?
- I don't have to take this crap.

1036
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,578
If you're over Joe,
why not see people?

1037
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,871
I see people!

1038
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,333
See people! Have you slept
with one person since Joe?

1039
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,252
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1040
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,298
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?!

1041
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,133
You have to move back to New Jersey

1042
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,052
'cause you've slept
with everyone in New York.

1043
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,514
I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

1044
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,184
Besides, I will make love
when it is making love.

1045
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,813
Not the way you do it, like you're
out for revenge or something.

1046
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,065
Are you finished now?

1047
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:43,193
Yes.

1048
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,695
Can I say something?

1049
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,531
Yes.

1050
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,869
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1051
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,174
Don't say a word!

1052
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,889
(Jess) It's a monkey, a monkey.
Monkey see, monkey do.

1053
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,476
- It's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

1054
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,770
- Planet of the Apes!
- She said baby!

1055
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:19,938
Try Planet of the Dopes.

1056
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,900
- It doesn't look like a baby.
- (Harry) Big mouth. Jagger as a baby.

1057
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,611
- (Jess) Baby ape!
- (Harry) Stop with the apes.

1058
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:29,948
- Um, baby's breath.
- Rosemary's Baby's... mouth?

1059
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,617
- "Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?"
- Kiss the baby!

1060
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:37,330
- "Melancholy Baby's Mouth!"
- Baby fish... Baby-fish mouth!

1061
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,083
- 15 seconds.
- (Harry) A big mouth.

1062
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,210
- (woman) Baby boom!
- (Harry) Baby...

1063
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,963
(Jess) Draw something
resembling anything!

1064
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,758
- Crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up... Exorcist baby!

1065
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:52,721
- (woman) "Yes Sir, That's My Baby."
- (Harry) "No sir, don't mean maybe."

1066
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,640
- That's it. Time's up.
- Baby talk.

1067
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:59,144
Baby talk? What's that?
That's not a saying.

1068
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,772
But "baby-fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation. I hear them talking!

1069
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,901
Final score. Our team: 1 10.

1070
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,028
You guys: 60.

1071
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:11,406
- (Harry) Ouch. Fix! Definitely a fix.
- Pathetic.

1072
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,658
- I can't draw.
- No...

1073
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,786
That's a baby,
and it's clearly talking.

1074
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,747
You're wonderful.

1075
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,750
- (Marie) Who wants coffee?
- (Jess) I do, and I love you.

1076
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,711
- (Alice) D'you have tea?
- Industrial strength.

1077
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:28,423
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

1078
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,134
- Three.
- Yes, please.

1079
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,346
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

1080
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,271
Never looked like a baby to me.

1081
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,898
- Which part?
- All of it.

1082
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:48,401
- You were gonna show me a book cover.
- Yeah, it's in the den.

1083
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:52,781
Julian, help yourself.
Have some more wine, whatever, OK?

1084
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,241
I like saying den.
Got a nice ring to it.

1085
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,536
Emily's a little young for Harry,
don't you think?

1086
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,456
Well, she's young,
but look what she's done.

1087
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,917
What has she done? She makes desserts.

1088
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,002
Does Julian seem
a little stuffy to you?

1089
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,463
He's a good guy.
You should talk to him.

1090
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,006
He's too tall to talk to.

1091
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:13,343
She makes 3,500
chocolate-mousse pies a week.

1092
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,888
Emily is "Aunt Emily?"

1093
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,516
He took us to a Met game
last week. It was great.

1094
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,476
You all went to a Met game together?

1095
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,145
Yeah, but...
it was a last-minute thing.

1096
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,689
But Sally hates baseball.

1097
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:28,066
Harry doesn't even like sweets.

1098
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,735
Julian is great.

1099
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,862
I know. He's a grown-up.

1100
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,239
Emily is terrific.

1101
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,408
Yeah. But when I asked
where she was...

1102
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,743
..when Kennedy was shot,
she said "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

1103
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:39,911
No.

1104
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,923
(phone rings)

1105
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,134
- Hello?
- (Sally) Are you alone?

1106
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,344
Yeah. I was just finishing a book.

1107
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,305
- (sobbing) Could you come over?
- What's the matter?

1108
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:02,517
- He's getting married.
- Who?

1109
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,728
Joe!

1110
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,980
I'll be right there.

1111
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,237
- Hi.
- Are you all right?

1112
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,950
Come on in.

1113
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,748
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

1114
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,293
- I need a Kleenex!
- OK.

1115
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,919
OK. OK.

1116
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:33,298
He just called me up,
"Wanted to see how you were",...

1117
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,842
.."Fine. How are you?" "Fine."

1118
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,596
His secretary's on vacation,
everything's all backed up.

1119
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:43,558
He's got a big case in Newark,
blah, blah, blah.

1120
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:48,897
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking
"I am over him, I really am over him,...

1121
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:53,193
..I can't believe I was ever
remotely interested in any of this."

1122
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,530
And then he said "I have some news."

1123
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:05,705
She works in his office.
She's a paralegal. Her name is Kimberly.

1124
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,542
He just met her!

1125
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:15,256
She's supposed to be his
transitional person, not "the one!"

1126
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:25,433
All this time... I've been saying...
that he didn't wanna get married.

1127
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,062
But the truth is...

1128
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,940
..he didn't wanna marry me.

1129
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,320
He didn't love me.

1130
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,035
If you could take him back
right now, would you?

1131
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,872
No!

1132
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,917
But why didn't he wanna marry me?

1133
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,462
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

1134
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,923
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

1135
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,677
- I'm too structured. I'm closed off.
- But in a good way.

1136
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,098
No, no, no. I drove him away.

1137
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,602
And I'm gonna be 40!

1138
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,188
When?

1139
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,732
- Some day.
- In eight years.

1140
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:20,405
But it's there! It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

1141
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:26,911
And it's not the same for men. Charlie
Chaplin had babies when he was 73.

1142
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,289
Yeah, but he was too old to pick 'em up.

1143
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,755
Oh, come here. Come here.

1144
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,757
It's gonna be OK.

1145
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:42,302
It's gonna be fine, you'll see.

1146
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,556
Go ahead. It's not one
of my favorites anyway.

1147
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:50,894
It's gonna be OK. Hm?

1148
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,943
Hm? OK?

1149
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:00,987
OK.

1150
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,033
I'll make some tea.

1151
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,702
Harry, could you
hold me a little longer?

1152
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,704
Oh, sure.

1153
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,539
Oh.

1154
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,296
OK? Hm?

1155
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,080
Are you comfortable?

1156
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,165
Sure.

1157
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:03,007
- D'you want something to drink?
- No, I'm OK.

1158
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:07,845
I'm going to get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

1159
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,098
OK. Water.

1160
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:10,199
You have all your video tapes
alphabetized and on index cards.

1161
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:11,743
Thank you.

1162
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:15,621
- D'you wanna watch something?
- No. Not unless you do.

1163
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,291
No. That's OK.

1164
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,933
- D'you wanna go to sleep?
- OK.

1165
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,956
(movement)

1166
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,386
Where are you going?

1167
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:15,181
I gotta go.

1168
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:19,519
Gotta go home, change my clothes
and go to work. And so do you.

1169
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:23,481
But after work I'd like to take you
out to dinner, if you're free. You free?

1170
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,192
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

1171
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,153
- Fine.
- Fine.

1172
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,541
(phone rings)

1173
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,216
- Yours!
- Hello.

1174
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,635
- Sorry to call so early.
- Are you all right?

1175
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:56,180
- No one I know would call at this hour.
- (phone rings)

1176
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,349
- No one I know would call.
- It's awful.

1177
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,309
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

1178
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:02,437
- Harry came over.
- I went to Sally's.

1179
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,314
- I was upset Joe was marrying.
- One thing led to another.

1180
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,650
Before I knew it we were kissing.
Then...

1181
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:10,069
- (both) ..we did it.
- (both) They did it!

1182
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,238
- That's great!
- We prayed for it.

1183
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,074
- You shoulda done it before.
- We said you should do it.

1184
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,869
- You belong together.
- You killed two birds with one stone.

1185
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:20,580
- Two wrongs make a right.
- (both) How was it?

1186
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:22,248
- During part was good,...
- Good,...

1187
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,417
- ..then I felt suffocated.
- ..then it wasn't.

1188
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:25,793
- Sorry.
- The worst.

1189
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,295
- I had to go.
- He left.

1190
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,130
- I feel bad.
- I'm embarrassed.

1191
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,548
- I don't blame you.
- That's horrible.

1192
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,633
- I feel ill.
- I'm catching a cold.

1193
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,427
Look, it didn't work out.

1194
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:38,055
Never sleep with anyone
when you find out your ex is marrying.

1195
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:40,057
- Who's talking?
- Is that Jess?

1196
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:42,727
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.
- It's Bryant Gumbel.

1197
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,437
(both) Wanna have breakfast?

1198
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,647
- No, I'm not up to it.
- I feel too awful.

1199
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,733
- (both) Good.
- I mean, it's so early.

1200
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,277
- But call me later.
- I'll call you later.

1201
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:52,653
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

1202
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,906
- Bye.
- Bye.

1203
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:58,826
- God!
- I know.

1204
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,997
Tell me I'll never have to be
out there again.

1205
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:09,170
You will never have
to be out there again.

1206
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,926
(Sally) I'll just say we made a mistake.

1207
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:18,513
(Harry) Sally, it was a mistake.

1208
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,392
I just hope I get to say it first.

1209
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:26,938
I hope she says it before I do.

1210
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:31,067
It was a mistake.

1211
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,653
I am so relieved
that you think so, too.

1212
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,406
I'm not saying last night wasn't great.

1213
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:41,285
- It was!
- Yes, it was!

1214
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:45,831
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

1215
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:49,335
- I am so relieved!
- Great.

1216
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:52,213
Yeah. (chuckles awkwardly)

1217
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,883
Two mixed green salads.

1218
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:30,334
It is so nice when you can sit
with someone and not have to talk. Hm?

1219
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,716
Most of the time,
you go to bed with someone,...

1220
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:40,928
..then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her all your stories.

1221
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,849
But with Sally and me,
we'd already heard each other's stories.

1222
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:49,020
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do. You know?

1223
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,439
Sure, Harry.

1224
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:53,733
I don't know.

1225
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,610
Maybe you get to a point
in a relationship

1226
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:59,530
where it's too late
to have sex. You know?

1227
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:11,500
Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?

1228
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,711
I don't think so.

1229
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,422
Is he seeing anyone?

1230
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,635
He was seeing
this anthropologist, but...

1231
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:25,723
- What does she look like?
- Thin, pretty, big tits.

1232
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,475
Your basic nightmare.

1233
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:33,564
What d'ya think?

1234
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,693
Oh, Marie...

1235
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,237
Tell the truth.

1236
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:44,200
It's just beautiful.

1237
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:21,612
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Marie and Jess.

1238
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:25,491
And to consecrate
their vows of matrimony.

1239
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:29,120
The vows they will take
join their lives.

1240
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:34,375
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

1241
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,836
And by the rings they will wear,...

1242
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:41,966
..they will be known to all
as husband and wife.

1243
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,385
(♪ trad jazz)

1244
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:55,980
(Sally) I've never seen her so happy.
She's a different person.

1245
01:18:56,148 --> 01:19:00,860
Oh, yeah, she is. It's great,
but what're we gonna do about you?

1246
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:03,404
- Me?
- Hon, you wanna dance?

1247
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,073
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, I do.
- Excuse us.

1248
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:12,204
- Hi.
- Hello.

1249
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,003
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

1250
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,798
Boy, the holidays are rough!

1251
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:26,761
Every year I try to get from
Thanksgiving to New Year.

1252
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,513
- A lot of suicides.
- Mm.

1253
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:33,559
- Would you like a pea pod with shrimp?
- Thank you.

1254
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,521
- How've you been?
- Fine.

1255
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,273
- Seeing anybody?
- Harry.

1256
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,192
- What?
- I don't wanna talk about this.

1257
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:44,695
- Why not?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1258
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:49,533
Why can't we get past this? Are we
gonna carry this thing around for ever?

1259
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:54,038
- Forever? Itjust happened!
- It happened three weeks ago.

1260
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,124
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

1261
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,127
Yes!

1262
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,299
Is one of us supposed to be a dog
in this scenario?

1263
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,927
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

1264
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:11,388
- You are.
- I am! I am the dog!

1265
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:14,016
I am the dog! I...

1266
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:22,691
I don't see that. You are the dog.

1267
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:25,069
You act like what happened
didn't mean anything.

1268
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:28,405
No, I don't, but why
does it have to mean everything?

1269
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:29,907
Because it does!

1270
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:33,911
You know it better than anyone,
'cause after it happens you walk out!

1271
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,039
- I didn't walk out.
- Sprinted is more like it.

1272
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:40,626
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made!

1273
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:44,338
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

1274
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,632
Fine! But let's just
get one thing straight.

1275
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,427
I did not go over there
to make love to you.

1276
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:54,598
But you looked at me with these weepy
eyes: "Don't go home. Hold me, Harry."

1277
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:58,602
- What was I supposed to do?
- Are you saying you took pity on me?

1278
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,855
- No! I was...
- Fuck you!

1279
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:04,733
(drum roll)

1280
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:08,028
Everybody, could I have
your attention, please?

1281
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:12,408
I'd like to propose a toast,
to Harry and Sally.

1282
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:14,410
To Harry and Sally.

1283
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:18,998
If Marie or I had found either of them
remotely attractive,...

1284
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:22,334
- ..we would not be here today.

I didn't know that you would...
That you were there.

- What do you want, Harry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1322
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:06,665
I... I just called to say I'm sorry.

1323
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:10,085
OK.

1324
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:20,679

What're you doin' for New Year's?

1326
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:26,143
Going to the Tylers' party? I don't
have a date. If you don't have a date,

1327
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:31,356
we always said we could
be together for New Year's and...

1328
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:35,277
I can't do this any more.
I am not your consolation prize.

1329
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:36,945
Goodbye.

1330
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:51,502

..coming to you live...

1332
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:57,424
(Harry) What's so bad about this?
You got Dick Clark. That's tradition.

1333
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:00,344
You got Mallomars,
the greatest cookie of all time.

1334
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:05,265
And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.

I let you drag me to this.

Oh!

1344
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:06,368
Yeah.

1345
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:11,915
- I'm going home.
- You'll never get a taxi.

1346
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,084
Oh, God!

1347
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,448
You realize that
we could never be friends.

1348
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,909
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,...

1349
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:48,327
..men and women can't be friends,

1350
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:50,662
'cause the sex part
always gets in the way.

1351
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,206
That's not true!

1352
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,958
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

1353
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:59,129
- He always wants to have sex with her.
- What if they don't wanna have sex?

1354
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,966
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

1355
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:05,636
And that is the end of the story.

1356
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:07,679
I guess we're not
gonna be friends then.

1357
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:10,140
- Guess not.
- That's too bad.

should we forget old acquaintances?

1411
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:58,618
Or ifwe forget them,
should we remember them?

1412
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:01,037
Which is not possible
'cause we already forgot 'em!

1413
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:06,460
Maybe itjust means we should remember
that we forgot them, or something.

1414

Anyway, it's about old friends.

we hated each other.

1416

we met, you didn't even remember me.

- It really was... a beautiful wedding.

1425

- We had this enormous coconut cake.
- Huge coconut cake with the tiers.

1426

And there was this very rich
chocolate sauce on the side.

1427
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:59,054
Right. 'Cause not everybody likes it
on the cake 'cause it makes it soggy.

1428
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:02,432
Particularly, the coconut soaks up
a lot, so it's important

1429
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,767
- to keep it on the side.
- Right.
