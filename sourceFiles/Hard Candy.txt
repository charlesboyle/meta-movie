1
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,260
Mmm.

2
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,100
This is so good.

3
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,340
I want more.

4
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,820
Don't get greedy.

5
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,220
Jeff?

6
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,940
Hayley.

7
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,300
Sorry.

8
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,340
I was gonna be, like,
so sophisticated when we met.

9
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,780
Little hard to do that with your
mouth full of whatever that is.

10
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,940
It's great. It's great.
Do you want some?

11
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,140
Sure.

12
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,820
Yum.

13
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,220
It's, um...kind of
what I was thinking.

14
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,460
Sorry?

15
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,940
You just don't look like
the kind of guy

16
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,140
who has to meet girls
over the internet.

17
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,500
I think it's better to meet
people online first sometimes.

18
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
You get to know
what they're like inside.

19
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,540
When you work as a photographer,
you find out real quick,

20
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,140
people's faces lie.

21
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,140
Does my face lie?

22
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,060
I look at those eyes
and I see...

23
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,580
a girl who reads Zadie Smith,

24
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,180
who listens to John Mayer
and ColdPlay,

25
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,900
who loves Monty Python episodes

26
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,820
and who, desperately,

27
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,860
madly, deeply, wants,

28
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,100
needs, longs for...

29
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,260
more chocolate.

30
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,700
Excellent, excellent
judge of character.

31
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,660
Can I get two of those truffles

32
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,780
and two ganaches?

33
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,660
Now what's a ganache?

34
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,900
You don't know
what a ganache is?

35
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,140
Lucky you're with
a woman of the world

36
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,660
to introduce you
to these things.

37
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,180
And two
chocolate-covered hearts.

38
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,300
And a decaf latte for me.

39
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,580
And...?
I'm good.

40
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,500
Yeah, you do appear so.

41
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,140
So what's in the bag?

42
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,660
Oh, you know, just,
like, books and stuff.

43
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,340
I figured if you stood me up,

44
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,700
then I should have
something to read.

45
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,380
Well...I couldn't really decide.

46
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,540
I'm reading this book
about Jean Seberg.

47
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,980
She's this actress

48
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,300
who slept with all
the wrong people

49
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,260
and ended up killing herself.

50
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,740
Don't you do that.

51
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,220
No. I-I intend to sleep
with all the right people.

52
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,620
Plus, I'm reading
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

53
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,860
It's a ninth grade book,

54
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,740
but I figured
I could have it done

55
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,900
before the school
year starts, so...

56
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,540
Doesn't look like
Elizabethan tragedy.

57
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,500
Oh, ah, no, that's 'cause--

58
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,300
Well, my dad--
he's letting me audit

59
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,780
one of his med
school courses, right?

60
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,060
I don't really understand
half of it,

61
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,580
but I totally love it.

62
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,060
What?

63
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,700
So you go to UCW

64
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,020
and you sit in a lecture hall
with all these grad students

65
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,980
and, what,
do they hit on you?

66
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,020
Why? Are you jealous?
Just admiring.

67
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,860
I didn't know you were interested
in that kind of thing.

68
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,140
What?

69
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,540
You thought since we'd been
chatting for three weeks

70
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,580
that you knew
everything about me?

71
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,940
Plus, they wouldn't hit
on a 14-year-old girl.

72
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,060
They're, like, old enough
to be my dad, so...

73
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,940
They're like...

74
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,420
They're bad older.
They're-- You're not--

75
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,740
I'm so articulate.

76
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,500
Sorry. Can I just,
like, start over?

77
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,820
No. I get it. I get it.
I just thought...

78
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,940
You know, well, you look
older than you are.

79
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,340
You certainly act
older than you are.

80
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,300
Really?

81
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,100
Yeah. I was expecting someone
not as impressive.

82
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,300
Me too.

83
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,980
Cool shirt.

84
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,140
You want it?

85
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,500
No, I didn't really bring
enough bucks, so...

86
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,540
And yet, not actually
what I was asking.

87
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,980
Sure, I want it.

88
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,020
Can I get a green shirt
in a small, please?

89
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,500
No. No, no.

90
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I can't let you do that.
What? Because--

91
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,260
Because--
What? Because you'd be so

92
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,980
indebted to me
that you'd have to...

93
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,140
Okay. I guess I can
let you do that.

94
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,900
You have to model
it for me, though.

95
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,100
Conditions. I can't live
with all these conditions.

96
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,260
Thanks.

97
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,620
This is so unfair.
What?

98
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,260
This is when things happen,
in the middle of the night,

99
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,780
by which time I am completely
out of the scene.

100
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,740
Life as a teenager.

101
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,980
I just hate having to depend on
Lindsey to drive me everywhere.

102
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,460
You'll be driving
before you know it.

103
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,940
In the meantime,

104
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,580
I missed Elizabeth Wurtzel
speaking at USC

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,140
and the Goldfrapp concert.

106
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,420
I was at the Goldfrapp
concert actually.

107
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,660
Shut up. You were?
Mm-hmm.

108
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,020
Was it great?

109
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,060
Of course it was great.
What am I saying?

110
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,220
Well, you could judge
for yourself.

111
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,820
I got a bootleg MP3.
You have the concert?

112
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,980
Just one song.

113
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,700
A little louder, please,
so the authorities know.

114
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,460
I totally have to hear it.

115
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,540
I'll send it to you.

116
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,060
After you get home,
after you get around to it.

117
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Good things are worth the wait.

118
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,260
Oh....

119
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,340
And what have you waited
for recently?

120
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,980
I'm gonna have to wait
four years for you.

121
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,940
You are just trying
to distract me from that MP3.

122
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,460
Look, I have to send it.

123
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,860
It's not like I could just
take you over to my house.

124
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,620
That would be
a little insane.

125
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,540
True.

126
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,300
Okay, now don't peek.

127
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,060
I shoot models for a living.

128
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,780
I've seen it all before.

129
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,620
And you're so sure about that?

130
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,860
I'm thinkin' yeah.

131
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,180
Maybe you should peek

132
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,140
and make that clerk wonder
what's going on over here.

133
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,100
In your dreams, little girl.

134
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,620
Little girl?

135
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,100
Whatever happened
to how mature I was?

136
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,900
Is this mature enough for you?
Okay...

137
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,940
Keep teasing me like that,
you're gonna drive me crazy.

138
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,660
Is that so?

139
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,340
Okay. All right.

140
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,700
How's this?

141
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,660
Nice.

142
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,820
Okay.

143
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,580
Now, there's three points
I have to make.

144
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,020
One: you wouldn't take
advantage because

145
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,260
you've been seen
with me here today.

146
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,980
And two: it's Goldfrapp.

147
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,260
And three?

148
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,940
Well, and three--

149
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,220
You said that it would
be insane for me

150
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,780
to come over and...

151
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,580
Four-- Four out of five doctors
agree that I am actually insane.

152
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,340
Thus, I have to come over

153
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,580
in order to be true to myself.

154
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,860
Right?

155
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,900
And the fourth reason:
this amazing car.

156
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,260
Well, in the face
of logic like that,

157
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,100
I bow down
and worship.

158
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,180
Bow down?

159
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,180
That's a good idea.
What are you waiting for?

160
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,420
Worship me.

161
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,340
Yes, oh, royal Thonggirl.

162
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,700
I am not worthy
to kiss your feet.

163
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,740
Well...maybe you are.

164
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,660
Maybe we should,
like, get going.

165
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,980
Yes, oh,
magnificent Thonggirl.

166
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,300
You wanna call your sister?
Tell her where you'll be?

167
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,700
Maybe later. I just wanna
get in this car.

168
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,620
Wow. So hot.

169
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,860
What's wrong?

170
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,980
Well, they teach
us "young things"

171
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,340
not to drink anything we haven't
mixed ourselves, so...

172
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,980
Smart.

173
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,164
Come back in the kitchen.
I'll pour it again.

174
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,420
No.
Come on.

175
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,260
I can whip up something
more entertaining than that.

176
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh...

177
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,740
Healthy dude, huh?

178
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,620
I try.

179
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,900
Figure I'll live
as long as I can.

180
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,980
Living long is overrated.

181
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,540
What? You don't want
to reach a ripe, old age?

182
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,380
For what?
When I'm 80?

183
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,420
What do I do for fun?

184
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,860
When you're 80 I'll be 98.

185
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,660
Right... and useless to me.

186
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,180
What use do you have
in mind for me?

187
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,740
Ah. I knew there'd be
something fun around here.

188
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,740
I bet these babes
got some dirt on you.

189
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,100
Those are models.

190
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,660
So why are they on your walls
instead of magazine covers?

191
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,260
Here, looking at you while

192
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,860
you know, you do
the most intimate things.

193
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,860
My house is my studio.

194
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,660
When clients come here, they're
walking into my giant portfolio.

195
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,620
So, what?
These were all shot here?

196
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,620
Oh, my God.

197
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,860
Okay, you are like
a big deal, aren't you?

198
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,220
I get work.

199
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,380
Isn't that one of those cameras
that gives you the square image?

200
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,740
How do you know that?

201
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,460
I'm a goon. I just, like,
read constantly.

202
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,620
You saw all those
books in my bag.

203
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,340
You're not reading now.

204
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,020
I'm not, am I?

205
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,540
Feels good.

206
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,940
Don't fall behind.

207
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,340
We should toast.

208
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,660
<i>Carpe...</i>

209
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,780
<i>omnious.</i>

210
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,380
What's that?

211
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,860
It's my own little toast.

212
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,500
You know <i>carpe diem.</i>

213
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,660
"Seize the day."

214
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,460
So I figure, <i>carpe omnious.</i>

215
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,180
"Take it all."

216
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,060
Take it all.

217
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,220
So, like,

218
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,660
what is it like to look through
your lens at some...

219
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,300
beautiful woman
who's working so hard

220
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,980
to look good for you?

221
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,580
You know these models.
They all have handlers.

222
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,140
People to make sure
their hair is just right

223
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,580
and their makeup is okay

224
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,660
and they don't get lost on
their way to their next gig.

225
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,020
So you never get
to be alone with them?

226
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,340
Rarely.
Poor Jeff.

227
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,980
I am compensated for my
troubles. Don't worry about me.

228
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,900
But I like worrying about you.

229
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,060
It makes me wonder...

230
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,980
What?

231
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,980
No, no. Forget it.

232
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,580
No, come on.

233
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,220
Come on. What's in that
insane mind of yours?

234
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,620
Okay. We'll have
another screwdriver

235
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,740
and then maybe I'll tell you.

236
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,460
I'm waiting.
Hold on.

237
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,020
You are not keeping up.

238
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,780
What?

239
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,580
Here's where you're supposed
to make it easier for me

240
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,060
and read my mind.

241
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,700
You're wondering how many
models I've done it with.

242
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,020
No.

243
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,620
How many?
None of them.

244
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,660
Oh, get out.
No. They're underage, mostly.

245
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,060
I'd be arrested.

246
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
So you're not arrested

247
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,620
for photographing
them like this?

248
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,140
I'm very aware
of the legal boundaries.

249
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,900
I have to be.
Right. Right.

250
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,260
'Cause secretly...
Secretly...

251
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,460
you would like to do them.

252
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,620
No. There's just one
that I slept with

253
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,620
when we were both younger.

254
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
That one?

255
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,940
Not out here.

256
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,940
In the bedroom?
No--

257
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,180
What's her name?

258
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,180
Hey.

259
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,260
"Janelle."

260
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,780
Yeah. Janelle.

261
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,060
So, what? What?

262
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,060
Was she, like, the first big
girlfriend or something?

263
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,420
That's right.

264
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,940
Learned everything I knew
practicing on her.

265
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,620
And that date--

266
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,100
Was that the first time
that you guys...

267
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,660
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

268
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,780
So, what? Where is she now?

269
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,420
She actually signed with Ford
right after this shoot.

270
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,500
She really took off. She, um...
Oh, my God.

271
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,380
She is, like, on magazine
covers. I know her.

272
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,940
Well, like, not personally,
obviously, but...

273
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,100
You are impressive
every second.

274
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,300
The models are impressive.
I just know how to bring it out.

275
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,660
You still love her.

276
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,860
No.

277
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,180
Ah...yeah.

278
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,180
No.
Yeah!

279
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,420
No.
Really?

280
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,780
No.
Really, really, really?

281
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,820
No.

282
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,500
I still love how simple things
were back then but...

283
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,140
You know, I--

284
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,700
I don't want to forget
that, but...

285
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,100
we've moved on.

286
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,740
You're lonely.

287
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,340
No.

288
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,740
I can hear it in your voice.

289
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,260
I'm a big boy.

290
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,620
I guess everyone kind of
has a Janelle, right?

291
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,100
I guess.

292
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,700
Hey. What if you got
one of your cameras

293
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,580
and we can see what you
can bring out in me.

294
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,820
This is what you wanted to ask?
Well, I--

295
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,220
It's not as easy as you think.
Okay.

296
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,460
Models don't just
pout their lips.

297
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,740
They have to be willing
to open up.

298
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,340
They have to show us
a little of their soul,

299
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,500
their secrets.

300
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,780
And most people only
open up from weakness.

301
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,140
Nobody wants to see photos
of weak people.

302
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,980
We look at great models
because they open up...

303
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,620
from a position of...

304
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,060
of, uh, of strength.

305
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,020
They have the strength...

306
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,820
to believe they
can do anything,

307
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,180
no matter how crazy, or, uh...

308
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,260
Are you okay?

309
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,740
Uh...

310
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,220
Let's try something.
Okay.

311
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,660
Uh-uh. Do me out here.

312
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,900
I shoot everyone in my studio.
Oh, come on.

313
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,620
Clearly not.

314
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,380
Come on, Jeff. Shoot me.

315
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,980
Come on. Shoot me.

316
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,380
Shoot me.

317
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,580
Don't do that.
What?

318
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,060
That phony music video crap.

319
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,420
Come on.

320
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,060
Just be yourself.

321
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,380
Just be open.

322
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,140
Weren't you just listening to me?
Come on, Jeff.

323
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,980
Sit down. Shoot me.

324
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:04,860
Look at me.

325
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,180
Be honest.

326
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,140
Would you listen to me?
Just sit down.

327
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,500
Jeff, I don't--
Sit down.

328
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,460
J-Jeff, I don't--
Sit down!

329
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,340
Are you okay?

330
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,580
I don't feel so good.

331
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,380
Did you-- Did you call me?

332
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,180
Sorry. I was just looking
through your medicine cabinet.

333
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,700
Okay, boring! No <i>Valley of
the Dolls</i> stuff at all.

334
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,220
Can't help but wondering
why all the lubricants though.

335
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,340
Oh, hey, just--
Tell me when you're ready.

336
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,700
Take your time.

337
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,300
What did you...

338
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,740
What di--
You remember what I said

339
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,540
about not drinking anything
you didn't mix yourself?

340
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,180
That's good advice
for everyone.

341
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,780
You know what? I'm sorry
you were drugged for so long.

342
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,700
I've never really
done that before

343
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,300
and I swiped this
from my dad.

344
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,100
Didn't come with directions

345
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
and it's not like
I could just ask him

346
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,940
how much to use.

347
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,580
So I probably used too much

348
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,100
or those screwdrivers

349
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,100
could have affected
my judgment, you think?

350
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,660
It's real water.

351
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,140
Scout's honor.

352
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,100
Ahh.

353
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,380
Wha--?

354
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,620
Why do I get...
tied up first

355
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,540
if this is how
we're gonna play?

356
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
Jeff...

357
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,100
play time is over.

358
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,900
Now it's time to wake up.

359
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,700
This isn't funny.

360
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,860
Is this some...teenage joke?

361
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,660
Teenage...

362
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,020
yes.

363
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,660
Joke?

364
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,380
No.

365
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,420
Now let me--
Patience.

366
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,540
Let me go. Let me go!
Patience.

367
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,780
Let me go!
Patience.

368
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,180
I'm just checking out
the side of the house, okay?

369
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,580
You know, I saw this cop show
once. It was great.

370
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,700
And the killer,

371
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,140
he thought he had cleaned
up all the evidence

372
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,980
but some of the victim's
blood was on his shirt

373
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,580
and, yeah, sure,
he washed it,

374
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,180
but some of the dried up blood
got caught in the lint trap,

375
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,260
I mean...

376
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,300
Anything in here
I should know about?

377
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,340
What the fuck are you doing?

378
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,620
That's kind of been
my question, Jeff.

379
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,860
What the fuck are you doing,

380
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,980
living in a house filled
with pictures

381
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,460
of half-naked teenage girls?

382
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,260
Oh, none of whom
you've ever done it with--

383
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,340
Help! Help!

384
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,420
Help! He--

385
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,860
There is really no point
in me taking any risks, Jeff.

386
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,140
Technically, I could let you
scream your fucking brains out

387
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,780
and no one is going
to hear you.

388
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,220
Yeah, I waited till today
because Mr. Coughlin is at work,

389
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,660
and the Kraskows--

390
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,900
they're vacationing
in Santa Barbara.

391
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,860
Still, I can't have
some pedestrian

392
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,700
just happening by
as you're screaming,

393
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,140
so shut up or next time
it's gonna be bleach, okay?

394
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,020
You've been stalking me?

395
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,100
Okay.

396
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,940
All right. Let's get
this straight.

397
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,380
You have been stalking me.

398
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,660
Yeah. I went into other chat
rooms, with different nicknames.

399
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,540
You would get to know
each woman...

400
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,740
and then as soon as
you found out

401
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,540
they were any
bit older than me

402
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,220
you would just drop
them like that.

403
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,460
You took your time
sniffing out someone my age.

404
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,260
I didn't talk to the others
because they were boring.

405
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,820
You and I connected.
Oh, mm-hmm, right.

406
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,380
Come on. You think
I faked all that?

407
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,860
You know, actually
it's kind of funny.

408
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,340
Because every time
I would mention

409
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,860
some, like, obscure
singer or band,

410
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,460
you knew so much about them.

411
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,940
But not right away.

412
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,140
It was, like,
a few minutes later.

413
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,780
Maybe to give you enough time
to look them up on the web?

414
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,940
Jeff...

415
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,300
you used the same phrases
about Goldfrapp

416
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,900
as they do on Amazon.com.

417
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,420
Busted.

418
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,380
By the way,

419
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,860
I fucking hate...
<i>Goldfrapp.</i>

420
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,260
Come on.

421
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,780
I wanted to impress you.

422
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,060
I'm not the first guy
to do something stupid

423
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,620
to impress a girl.

424
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,940
Does that deserve being
tied up and tortured?

425
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,980
Torture?

426
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,020
Is this torture to you?

427
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,020
I guess you've never
read anything

428
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,420
by Amnesty International

429
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,860
or Human Rights Watch
because this...

430
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,140
This... is nothing.

431
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,780
Of course you're not the first
guy to lie to a girl, Jeff.

432
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,300
The operative word
there being "girl."

433
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,340
I mean, you know
how old I am.

434
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,500
What makes a kid who's barely
past her first period

435
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,940
worth all this research?

436
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,340
I mean, you really got
to start to wonder

437
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,660
when a grown man goes
through all this trouble

438
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,300
just to charm a girl.

439
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,020
Wow. There's that word again.

440
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,420
"Girl."

441
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,900
You know, maybe it's
this whole camera thing?

442
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,980
Cameras...computers.

443
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,540
They let you hide, don't they?

444
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,020
So safe.

445
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,140
I heard how your voice changed
when the camera came between us.

446
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,860
My voice changed
because I felt sick

447
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,780
because you drugged me.

448
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,540
Yeah, you were drugged,
all right.

449
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,500
And the drug was sweet,

450
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,740
little 14-year-old flesh.

451
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,860
Look...

452
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,460
I'm a decent guy,
ask anyone.

453
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,580
Go ahead. Call these models.
They'll tell you.

454
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,060
Of course they will.

455
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,220
You're not an idiot, Jeff.

456
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,660
You don't piss where you live.

457
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,940
Those girls were your work
and I, on the other hand was...

458
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,580
your play.

459
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,900
You were coming on to me.
Oh, come on.

460
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,220
That's what they always say.

461
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,540
Who?
Who?

462
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,940
The pedophiles!

463
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,700
"She was so sexy.
She was asking for it."

464
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,860
"She was only technically
a girl. She acted like a woman."

465
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,740
It's just so easy
to blame a kid, isn't it?

466
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,060
Just because a girl
knows how to imitate a woman

467
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,740
does not mean she's ready
to do what a woman does.

468
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,540
I mean, you're
the grown-up here.

469
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,940
If a kid is experimenting

470
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,580
and says something
flirtatious, you ignore it.

471
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,900
You don't encourage it.

472
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,500
If a kid says,
"Hey, let's make screwdrivers,"

473
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,980
you take the alcohol away

474
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,340
and you don't race them
to the next drink!

475
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,580
Look, look.

476
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,380
I've been lonely, okay?

477
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,940
That makes me stupid
but I am not a pedophile.

478
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,220
I am not lonely.
This is some horrible mistake.

479
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,151
And not stupid. Untie me.

480
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:46,740
We'll forget this whole thing.
Just untie me now!

481
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,660
I might be a little peeved.
So when I am ready to go,

482
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,820
I'll call a cab and call another
one to let you loose.

483
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,340
When will that be?
I'm not sure yet.

484
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,180
Don't--

485
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,380
You can save yourself
so much time

486
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,660
by just dropping that word
from your vocabulary.

487
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,900
I'm gonna do
what I want, Jeff.

488
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,620
See...

489
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,340
a guy as smooth at seducing
adolescents as you are

490
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,300
and takes those photographs--

491
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,620
I just figure

492
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,740
he has something around
that he doesn't want seen,

493
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,500
and when I find that,

494
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,660
then maybe I'll know
what I'm dealing with.

495
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,860
What you're dealing with?

496
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,500
I mean, what kind
of pedophile are you?

497
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,580
Just a voyeur?

498
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,260
Again, not a pedophile.

499
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Right. You're a photographer.

500
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,660
Takes a genius to get paid

501
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,900
for what you'd be happy
to do for free.

502
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,580
Go into the living room.

503
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,220
Look in the grey cabinet.
Pull out the third drawer down.

504
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,740
You'll see prints
of my work

505
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,220
for all kinds
of environmental groups.

506
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,100
I've done shots of
the Yukon Territory,

507
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,220
the Utah wilderness,

508
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,540
Inuit villages in Alaska...

509
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,740
So what?

510
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,020
You love nature, thus you
must be a nice guy?

511
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,340
I'm saying my modeling shots
are just part of my portfolio.

512
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,180
I've shot a lot of
different subjects,

513
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,900
some of it very important work.

514
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,780
And it was so important
that you thought,

515
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,860
"Well, I can't possibly
hang it on the walls of my home.

516
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,340
I need to plaster my house
with pictures of underage nymphs

517
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,060
and just tuck the nature
shots away."

518
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,700
So...a voyeur
and a conservationist.

519
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,900
I'm not a voyeur!

520
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,260
Not just a voyeur.

521
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,020
Sometimes you kick it up
a notch to molestation.

522
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,380
I am not a molester!

523
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,500
I've no idea who you've
confused me with.

524
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,340
Sometimes you molest someone
and they fight back

525
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,580
and you lose control
and you hurt them.

526
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,780
I have never hurt anyone!

527
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,740
We'll just see, won't we?

528
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,620
Those letters are mine.

529
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,380
Nothing's yours when you invite
a teenager into your home.

530
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,820
Don't love her anymore, huh?

531
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,780
That explains why
you save these.

532
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,740
I thought about selling
them on e-Bay.

533
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,900
Excuse me?

534
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,180
Sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Maybe it was the music or...

535
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,660
I don't know.
Maybe it was the bullshit.

536
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,020
All right. Honestly...

537
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,780
Some day I thought about
sending them to her,

538
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,460
reminding her how much
of a bitch she was.

539
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,220
Oh.

540
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,900
A little angry, are we?

541
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,660
She broke your heart
and you haven't gotten over it?

542
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,020
You walk into somebody's house,

543
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,660
you start looking
through their shit--

544
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,140
You're gonna find things
that embarrasses them.

545
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,500
It doesn't mean anything.

546
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,020
All right. Okay.

547
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,580
"Dear Jeff.

548
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,380
"You have to stop. I can't
go where you wanna take me.

549
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,660
You're just not the person
I thought you were."

550
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,260
You don't have to read it.
I know what it says.

551
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,460
I bet you do. How many
times did you read this

552
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,460
over to yourself?

553
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,820
None of your business.

554
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,540
What kind of person did she
find out you were, Jeff?

555
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,820
None of your business.

556
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,460
That kind of depends on how
you define business, actually.

557
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,780
So, what? Did you find her?

558
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,100
The girl you wanted?

559
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,900
Is this what your work is,
some kind of big search?

560
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,300
Are you the type of guy

561
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,060
who likes to save his
outgoing e-mails?

562
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,500
Read them over and over again,
to think about what you said?

563
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,460
This is weird.

564
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,460
Your download manager says you
pulled some photos off the net,

565
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,740
but...I can't find them.

566
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,940
Gosh, that's strange.

567
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,260
Yeah. A smart guy doesn't leave
photos on his computer.

568
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,340
'Cause that's the first place
the cops are gonna look.

569
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,100
And then you're...
into mementos.

570
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,180
So where do you put
the stuff that you...

571
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,660
pull off the net, hm?

572
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,780
Do you have a special little
hiding place or something?

573
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,060
I live alone.

574
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,620
Why would I need
a hiding place?

575
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,500
Just what I've been wondering.

576
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,980
I have looked through
your whole house.

577
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,420
Everything....

578
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,660
and I have found no porn.

579
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,100
I have not found
a single bit...

580
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,340
of porn.

581
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,900
Guys tend to have porn
around don't they?

582
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,700
Nothing against it,
nothing against them.

583
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,580
It's just the way
they're brought up.

584
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,540
Seriously, if a guy knows
he can get away with it,

585
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,660
all guys, they have porn at
least somewhere in their crib.

586
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,740
You've done studies on this.
Then I was thinking--

587
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,420
that these photos on his wall,
maybe those are his porn.

588
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,700
But I bet they're not
your stroke shots.

589
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,460
I bet whatever you have is so...

590
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,220
juicy,

591
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,500
it needs its own
little cubbyhole.

592
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,900
Isn't that right, Jeff?

593
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,180
So what's
the combination, Jeff?

594
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,900
Eat me.

595
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,820
Look at how he's sweating.

596
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,020
Does this worry you, Jeff?

597
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,380
I'm gonna figure it out, so you
might as well just tell me.

598
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,340
I am an honor student.

599
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,660
Take your time.

600
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,540
Oh, I will.

601
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,180
Believe me, I've got plenty.
No, not much.

602
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,780
Aren't mommy and daddy
gonna worry

603
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,740
if you're not
home before dinner?

604
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,620
I'm thinking, no.

605
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,780
Oh, is that it?

606
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,540
What? They're too busy
to keep track of you,

607
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,980
so you reach out to
somebody who seems like

608
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
he might care about you?

609
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,900
And you're so mad
because they ignore you?

610
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,260
They always made the fuss
over your older sister

611
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,580
because she learned
to do everything first?

612
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,140
You're furious with them,

613
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,780
but they do love you

614
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,060
and they pay
for your existence,

615
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,660
but you can't let them
see any of that anger.

616
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,620
I'm not angry at them.
No, no. Absolutely not.

617
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,980
That'd be too dangerous.

618
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,460
But you are angry...

619
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,660
and you gotta
let it out somehow.

620
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,140
So you find a guy--
an older guy--

621
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,420
Maybe he reminds you
a little of your dad.

622
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,300
Let me guess.
I look like him?

623
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,060
You don't look
anything like him.

624
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,660
If you say so.

625
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,300
But you gotta let
that anger out somehow.

626
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,420
And I seem like a good target--
Will you shut up?

627
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,020
Seriously, just shut up!

628
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,300
You know nothing about me.

629
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,700
No, you're right.
So sit down and tell me.

630
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,140
We'll talk.

631
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,100
Yeah, right.
We can sit on the sofa.

632
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,580
And I'll call a taxi for you.

633
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,300
If you want, I'll hold you.

634
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,860
If you don't want,
I'll keep my distance.

635
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,740
You can let it all out.

636
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,460
If you need to cry,
if you need to scream.

637
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,340
Whatever you need, Hayley.

638
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,100
You wouldn't be mad at me?

639
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,860
I just want you to look
at what you're doing.

640
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,980
I just wanna ask, um...

641
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,020
Did you...

642
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,460
Did you seriously think
that that was gonna work?

643
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,820
You're good at what
you do, Jeff.

644
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,900
What you do is work with teenage
girls, put them at ease

645
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,340
so they can trust you
with all their secrets.

646
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,220
No, that's not
what I was doing.

647
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,940
Janelle's birthday.

648
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,020
Janelle's phone number.

649
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,620
Janelle's phone
number backwards.

650
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
You're an honor student.

651
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,180
Try every possible
combination of numbers.

652
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,380
Should only take you
the rest of the week,

653
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,500
if you figure in breaks
for meals.

654
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,180
Or I--

655
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,700
Or I could just try
March 19th.

656
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,780
March 19th.
First with Janelle.

657
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,900
What's this, Jeff?
You are lensman319 after all.

658
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,380
Was this the first photo
session

659
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,220
or the first time
you banged her?

660
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,940
Or was that the same thing?

661
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,660
Hm. What year would
that have been?

662
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,420
3-19-87?

663
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,380
Nope.

664
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,860
3-19-89?

665
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,620
How sentimental you are.

666
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,900
What's so special
about these photos?

667
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,260
Oh...

668
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,940
This is what they make
those federal laws for, Jeff.

669
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,500
This is officially sick.

670
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,940
What makes this girl
so special?

671
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,540
Hmm?

672
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,100
Why does she get
to keep her clothes on?

673
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,340
I recognize this girl.

674
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,620
Hayley?

675
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,820
Where are you?

676
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,340
Oh, fuck!

677
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,620
Welcome back.

678
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,860
I'm sorry to expose
you like this.

679
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,140
It's not about sex,
although I have to admit...

680
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,460
you are built.

681
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,220
I never touched you.

682
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,980
I was trying
to hold you off me

683
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,180
while I called the cops.

684
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,740
Would you have shown them this?

685
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,340
Why do you have a picture
of Donna Mauer in your safe?

686
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,220
And have you seen her,
because no one else has?

687
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,740
I did meet Donna for coffee.

688
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,300
I took a shot of her
to make her happy.

689
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,900
So how happy did you make her?

690
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,580
Look at her.
She's fully dressed.

691
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,420
You can see the coffee
shop behind her.

692
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,020
I never brought her home.

693
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,100
So, what?
You just said,

694
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,820
"See you later, kid.
It's been fun."

695
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,300
You could have
thrown this away.

696
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,860
You didn't.

697
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,740
You needed to hang on to it.

698
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,540
You could have talked
to the police.

699
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,260
You're right.
Yeah.

700
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,580
Or maybe you had
something to hide,

701
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,340
like the extensive
kiddy porn collect--

702
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,260
Look. I'm not the monster
you think I am.

703
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,980
But okay, I...crossed a line.

704
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,500
Just call the cops.
I'll turn myself in.

705
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,380
A cute pedophile
pleads guilty.

706
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,500
"But, oh, it's not his fault.

707
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,740
He's sick.
He has an addiction."

708
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,820
I'll do jail. Isn't that
what should happen?

709
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,860
Yeah, you might.
You might get jail time.

710
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,460
I don't know--
Therapy, drugs,

711
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,700
group discussions,

712
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,020
notifying people when you
move into a new house.

713
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,180
How bad is that, really?
It'll ruin my career, my life.

714
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,620
Didn't Roman Polanski
just win an Oscar?

715
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,260
So why the ice?

716
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,580
I read the psych profile

717
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,740
about the person
who took Donna Mauer.

718
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,700
Said he's a loner.

719
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,020
Thinks he's pretty damn bright

720
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,060
and as powerful
as a teenage girl.

721
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,980
He's gonna strike again.
Kind of sounds a lot like you.

722
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,980
It's not me!

723
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,900
Maybe not, but...

724
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,220
Those photos that I found

725
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,820
and the way you
let me get drunk--

726
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,820
You're a headline
waiting to happen.

727
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,620
Everybody will be safer

728
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,140
if I do a little
preventive maintenance.

729
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,380
What the fuck are you doing?
I have to shave you down here.

730
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,740
I can't have any hair
on the incision site, right?

731
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,260
What?

732
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,060
I've been going in my dad's
medical library at school

733
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,500
and, um, well, you said
I was pretty bright, right?

734
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,300
I think I'm smart enough
to perform

735
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,820
a successful castration.

736
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,020
No!

737
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,180
Please.
No! Ow!

738
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,860
Okay, okay. I guess you're
not numb enough yet.

739
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,980
What should we talk about
while we're waiting?

740
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,540
"Dear Janelle.
My name is Hayley Stark.

741
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,940
"I hope you don't mind me
writing you like this.

742
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,620
"I met this guy that I think
you know-- Jeff Kohlver.

743
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,420
"He's so cute.

744
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,780
"Well, he seems
to really like me.

745
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,900
"He even asked me over to his
place to do some photography,

746
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,180
"and I am so excited about this

747
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,580
"because, well,
for a 14-year-old like me,

748
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,860
this could be
a huge break, you know?"

749
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:21,140
And here I put in a little
smiley face icon.

750
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,460
"Thing is, and I've tried
to pretend this isn't the case,

751
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,540
"but he talks about
you an awful lot,

752
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,300
"and I have this ooky feeling
he's still in love with you.

753
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,940
"I'm pretty sweet on him too,

754
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,060
"but I don't want to go crazy
over him if there's some chance

755
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,580
"that you two might
get back together.

756
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,300
"So, so, so, so,

757
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,300
"I found your e-mail
address in his PDA,

758
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,580
"and I thought I'd just ask.

759
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,020
"Is this insane?

760
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,340
"Am I insane?

761
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,620
"Is Jeff?

762
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,300
"And this other girl
he talks about all the time.

763
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,740
"Her name is... Donna Mauer.

764
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,940
"Do you know anything
about her?

765
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,100
"I found these photos
on his computer

766
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,300
"but I can't figure out
how to open them,

767
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,980
"but I'm attaching them
to this note.

768
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,180
"Are they pictures
of you or Donna?

769
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,060
"Anyhoo, thanks a mil.

770
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,340
"Your complete honesty
will be "mucho" appreciated.

771
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,300
Love and peace, Hayley."

772
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,140
I tried to make
it sound as innocent

773
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,500
and moronic
as possible.

774
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,020
How do you think I did?

775
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,860
Fine.

776
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,820
Guess I'll just send it
and that'll be that.

777
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,020
You're getting yourself
in terrible trouble.

778
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,220
Oh, and how's that?

779
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,860
If you cut me in any way,
you won't forget it.

780
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,820
It changes you when
you hurt somebody.

781
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,980
And you speak from
experience, I guess.

782
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,540
I've just lived.

783
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,300
Unlike you.

784
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,180
The things you do wrong--

785
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,300
They haunt you.

786
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,420
Tell me what you're haunted by.

787
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,580
You wanna remember this day
when you're with a guy

788
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,860
on a date?

789
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,060
Or on your wedding night?

790
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,100
'Cause I promise you,
you will.

791
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,900
Don't do that to yourself.

792
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,420
Wow.

793
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,820
You know,
that is so thoughtful.

794
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,820
You are speaking to me
so selflessly.

795
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,380
I mean, you just don't
want me to castrate you

796
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,900
for my own benefit?

797
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,620
Wow, I'm touched.

798
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,060
Jeff.

799
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,940
Why don't we imagine someone
saying the same thing to you

800
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,620
at a random moment?

801
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,380
Imagine that, when you
downloaded this little girl...

802
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,980
I was sitting
by your side saying,

803
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,900
"Stop. Don't do that
to yourself."

804
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,820
Would you have listened?

805
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,420
Stop.

806
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,540
Don't do that to yourself.

807
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,660
Stop.

808
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,220
Don't do that to yourself.

809
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,340
Stop.

810
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,260
Stop.

811
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,100
You are good and numb,
aren't you?

812
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,660
Fuck off.

813
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,500
Your conversational skills

814
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,540
are really deteriorating
as the day goes on.

815
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,540
Seriously. It turns out
that castration

816
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,260
is the easiest surgical
procedure around,

817
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,940
and thousands of farm boys

818
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,940
across the country
guild their own livestock.

819
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,500
So I figure, if they can do it,
then I can pull it off,

820
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,660
if you know what I mean.

821
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,060
I'm not fucking livestock.

822
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,820
You keep telling
yourself that, stud.

823
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,660
Help!

824
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,180
Help!

825
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,340
Look, that wasn't necessary.

826
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,180
You bitch.

827
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,500
No more wiggling.

828
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,900
Does your mother know
you cut off men's balls?

829
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,740
I've never done it
before today, but...

830
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,140
Maybe I'll tell her
when I get home,

831
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,780
see what she says.

832
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,140
"Hayley, I knew you needed
a science fair project,

833
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,660
but really..."

834
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,980
So you and your mom
are both whacked.

835
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,860
I don't know.
That's that whole...

836
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,340
nature versus nurture
question, isn't it?

837
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,900
Was I born a cute, vindictive
little bitch or...

838
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,500
did society make me that way?

839
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,260
I go back and forth on that.

840
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,780
I'll be done in a sec.
I'm almost done.

841
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,260
There's money in the safe.

842
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,780
So?
So you could take it.

843
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,020
Take the camera equipment.
Take whatever you want!

844
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,340
I am.

845
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:31,620
You really can't talk me
out of this by bribing me, okay?

846
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,740
How-- How can I?

847
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,580
What? Talk me out of it?

848
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,420
I don't know.
I haven't thought about that.

849
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,700
You know what?

850
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,100
I need to sterilize
this before we start.

851
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,660
Do you want me to use
the vodka,

852
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,660
or do you have another alcohol
you wanna offer me?

853
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,220
Okay.

854
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,260
Okay, all that scraping I did--

855
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,980
The blood probably
rushed back in.

856
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,740
I have to numb you out
a bit more, okay?

857
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,340
I'll be right back.

858
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,420
Can I call someone for you?
Is that what you--

859
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,740
Oh, you're getting bored.

860
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,100
Look, I'm sorry. We gotta get
this show on the road.

861
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:00,660
Oh, it's actually
really impressive.

862
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,060
I thought it would be fun
to see how far you could get,

863
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,780
and I really only expected,
like, an inch or two.

864
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,060
That's... not bad.

865
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,900
Why don't you just kill me?

866
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,980
Is that what you think I want?

867
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,860
Isn't it?

868
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,300
Close.

869
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,660
I love that you have
all this stuff

870
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,220
because, like, this way
you can watch, you know?

871
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,500
Now I'm hurt.

872
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,100
I go through all the trouble
to set this up

873
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,020
and you don't even
want to watch?

874
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,140
I just--

875
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,180
I stayed one summer with my
Aunt Denise and her kids.

876
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,860
You know, and her kids
were, like four or five,

877
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,620
and I was, like, ten.

878
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,140
No. No, I was nine.

879
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,580
And the littlest one--

880
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,260
the daughter, Lynnie...

881
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,540
She...she loved me.

882
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,740
So she had this--
she had this game

883
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:36,340
where she would jump out of
the bathtub, all soaking wet...

884
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,380
and she'd jump on top of me

885
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,020
and she'd tickle me.

886
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,700
And she'd tickle me
and she'd shout:

887
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,500
"Prune attack!
Prune attack!"

888
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,740
'cause her fingers
were all pruney.

889
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,820
I-I-I couldn't do anything
'cause I was afraid I'd hurt her

890
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,940
and it was... weird.

891
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:03,020
And one day her mother
came in, in the middle of it...

892
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:09,300
and she saw her daughter,
naked on top of me.

893
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:15,980
And then...she yelled at her:

894
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,260
"Lynnie, get back
in the bathtub."

895
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,100
Then she took me by the hand...

896
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,740
and she dragged me
to the kitchen.

897
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,100
She turned the stove on.

898
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,460
We stood there while
the burner got hot.

899
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,380
And she pulled my pants down...

900
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:46,540
and lifted me up
over the burner.

901
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:54,700
I could feel the dirt
on my skin from her hands.

902
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,260
She must have been gardening.

903
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,020
And I cried and cried.

904
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:09,620
And I could hear the tears
sizzle as they hit the burner.

905
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,620
Then she sat me down.

906
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,580
She said, "If I ever catch you
with my daughter again..."

907
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,660
She called my mom.

908
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,620
My mom came the next day.

909
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,420
I never saw Aunt Denise again.

910
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,660
These things really stick.

911
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,620
Okay, well, you know, we're set.

912
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,380
Don't.

913
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,140
I told you not
to use that word.

914
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,140
Okay?

915
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,220
Hayley, please.

916
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,700
You need help.

917
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,300
A teenage girl
doesn't do this.

918
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,100
I've seen your idea of what
a teenage girl should do,

919
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,340
so don't even start.

920
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,580
I'll pay for a therapist.

921
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,540
Thanks.

922
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,820
Thanks, but if I ever
see a shrink--

923
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,660
I want to make my case...
Please.

924
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,500
really, really
interesting for them.

925
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,180
Please. I'll do
whatever you want.

926
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,340
You could call the cops. I'll
say I did whatever you want.

927
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,260
I don't think they're gonna
believe a confession

928
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,540
under these circumstances.

929
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,660
Then I'll leave.
I'll leave, okay? I'll move.

930
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,300
Mm-hmm.

931
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,740
Donna's body will still
be where you left it.

932
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,300
I'm not the guy!

933
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,620
I'm not the guy, I swear!

934
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,060
Anything! Please!

935
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,700
Please don't do this!

936
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,620
Anything?
Anything! Piss on me!

937
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,980
Fucking feed me glass!
I don't care! Whatever you want!

938
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,820
I'll tell the cops I did
whatever you want. Please!

939
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,460
I'll do whatever you want.
Anything. Please.

940
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,500
Please. Anything.

941
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,940
Anything. Anything.

942
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,940
Please.

943
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,340
Please!

944
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,660
Anything.
Yes.

945
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,460
Yeah, anything. Just--

946
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,380
Oh, please.

947
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,980
Please!

948
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,180
When I talked about sending
an email to Janelle,

949
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,780
you changed the subject.

950
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,660
I could send it right now,
pack up and go.

951
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,220
It could be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

952
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,500
You could stop
torturing yourself

953
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,500
with the idea that you might
get back with her someday.

954
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,441
What do you say?

955
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:52,380
Goddamn it!
Get the fuck off of me!

956
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,660
Please untie me and let me go!

957
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,420
Please! Please don't cut me!

958
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,380
Please! Please!

959
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,100
Please!

960
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,380
I shouldn't have teased
you like that.

961
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:38,080
I shouldn't have let you think
there was a way out of this.

962
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,020
Hey, um...

963
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,380
I got this medical text,

964
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,660
and if I forget anything
just don't panic.

965
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:55,780
Okay, 'cause it's--
It's right here.

966
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,740
Yeah, I knew you'd
want to watch.

967
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,780
Look, if you move too much,
I could...

968
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,420
knick the perineal artery
and you--

969
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,620
You could, like, bleed to death
before anyone got here, okay?

970
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,500
So, just, please.
I really need to have

971
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,140
a steady, steady hand, okay?

972
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,180
Jeff?

973
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,660
Do you feel that?

974
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,060
Why do you care?

975
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,420
I'd be thankful
for small favors.

976
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,100
Wow.

977
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,220
Wow. That went well.

978
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,620
You know, you told that, uh...

979
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:21,580
that Aunt Denise story
very well.

980
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,540
Very, very well.

981
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,140
What was that supposed to be?

982
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,420
Some kind of magic key

983
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,260
to explain why you are
the way you are?

984
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,140
Doesn't.

985
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,940
Okay. What should I do first?
Your right or left testicle?

986
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,500
Why don't we just
say right, okay?

987
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,740
All right, now, I just have
to give it

988
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,500
one little slice
to free it up,

989
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,020
and then, um...

990
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,100
Snip.

991
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,500
Okay. Now I just need
to suture it up.

992
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,980
This would be so much easier
if I had, like,

993
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,300
a nurse or something,

994
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,940
but, you know, I asked my friend
if she'd help me castrate a guy

995
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,700
and, well, she made all these,
like, ooky sounds,

996
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,100
like I was asking her
to swallow worms or something.

997
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,940
We'll see who makes medical
school in eight years, huh?

998
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,820
All right, now, you're
gonna feel a tug,

999
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,460
'cause I really gotta get
this tight, all right?

1000
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,380
So just...
bear with me.

1001
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,700
Okay...

1002
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,780
Okay.

1003
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,940
Okay, halfway through.
Over the hump.

1004
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,220
Can't you stop?

1005
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:41,540
Please?

1006
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,460
Some men,

1007
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:47,380
they go through their whole
lives with only one ball,

1008
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,180
and they're just fine,
you know?

1009
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,860
Or so I've read.

1010
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,540
Well, I guess I figured that,

1011
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,809
you're not really punished
if I leave you with a spare.

1012
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:03,180
Okay, stay with me.
Stay with me.

1013
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,540
It's okay.
It's okay, Jeff.

1014
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,060
If-if I left one,

1015
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,420
then you'd be walking around
crooked all the time.

1016
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,580
Look, this is for the best,
all right?

1017
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:20,020
Okay, you're entering
a whole new world now.

1018
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,740
Just gotta...

1019
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,940
snip and...

1020
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,420
Okay.

1021
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,380
Wow.

1022
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,820
This seriously
has to be, like,

1023
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:40,140
one of the easiest
operations, because...

1024
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:41,660
Wow.

1025
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:47,100
I wonder why they teach Girl
Scouts things like camping

1026
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,900
and selling cookies.

1027
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,820
You know? 'Cause this
is what's really useful.

1028
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,780
I don't know how they'd
design a merit badge.

1029
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,940
That'd be interesting.

1030
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,060
I saw Lynnie
at Aunt Denise's funeral.

1031
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,660
I told her what her mom did.

1032
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,540
She didn't believe me.

1033
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,820
If Aunt Denise was here
right now, what would you say?

1034
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,940
I'd say, "Help.

1035
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,820
A teenager cut my balls off.
Call the police."

1036
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,500
She wasn't very sympathetic
the last time,

1037
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,460
so I wouldn't really
hold your breath.

1038
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,860
All right.

1039
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,940
I would cancel any appointments
you have in the next few days

1040
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:52,140
because you're going to be sorer
than you've ever been before.

1041
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,980
Oh, I'd say, in, like,

1042
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,820
eight or nine days,
take the stitches out,

1043
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,420
which I suggest you do yourself

1044
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,300
to save embarrassment.

1045
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,580
Oh, and there's this website:
EunuchsQuestions.com.

1046
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:06,580
Eunuchs is e-u-n-u-c-h-s.

1047
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:09,740
I had a lot of trouble with that
but it gives great advice

1048
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,580
on how to deal with
your castration.

1049
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,940
You really--

1050
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,100
You don't have to go through
this alone, you know?

1051
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,180
Do you want some souvenirs?

1052
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,500
No?

1053
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,660
Okay.

1054
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,980
What should we do with them?

1055
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,900
We could see how
far they bounce.

1056
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,300
Actually...

1057
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,060
we wouldn't want,
like, a little animal

1058
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:49,420
confusing it for
an afternoon snack.

1059
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,300
You know?
A little squirrelly

1060
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,220
or a coyote might get sick.

1061
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,540
We don't want that,

1062
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,700
especially with you being
such a conservationist.

1063
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,260
We could grind them
up in the garbage disposal.

1064
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,340
Or-- or we could
sew them back in.

1065
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,980
I had this shop teacher once,

1066
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,700
who sawed off
his thumb in class,

1067
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,540
and then he grabbed some ice,

1068
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,060
drove to the emergency room.

1069
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,940
The next day, sure enough,
he has this thumb.

1070
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:23,060
Didn't bend so well, but he
could hitchhike and stuff.

1071
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,980
I'm just checking
to see if it works.

1072
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,220
I guess they,
uh, weren't brass.

1073
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:58,620
You're not laughing, are you?

1074
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:01,660
Well, no wonder. This isn't
a laughing matter at all.

1075
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,060
I don't know. Maybe Donna's
smiling just a tad.

1076
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,740
I didn't do anything to her.

1077
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,660
Maybe, maybe not.

1078
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:19,580
But I suggest you track down
the guy who did...

1079
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:22,140
'cause he has no idea
what's waiting for him.

1080
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,220
Here.

1081
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,780
You really need to rehydrate.

1082
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,940
Jeff. Please.
Come on.

1083
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,420
Jeff, I'm serious.

1084
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,860
You really, really need
to drink this, okay?

1085
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,220
Come on.

1086
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,020
Attaboy.

1087
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,620
Do you want more?

1088
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,140
Why are you being
so nice to me now?

1089
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,940
You're pitiful now,
aren't you?

1090
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,220
I mean, it's going
to be tricky,

1091
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,100
not letting anyone
find out about...

1092
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,420
No more sex.

1093
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:13,700
No more taking public showers.

1094
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,860
But one of these days
you're going to get a physical,

1095
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,900
and your doctor's going
to find out.

1096
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:23,380
And don't worry. He's not going
to tell his golf buddies,

1097
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,140
and they're not gonna
tell their friends,

1098
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,340
and they're not
gonna tell their friends.

1099
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:31,660
But a couple years down the road
you're going to start wondering,

1100
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,580
"Do your publishers know?"

1101
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,460
"Do your models know?"

1102
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,020
"Does Janelle know?"

1103
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,580
God, I'm sweating.

1104
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:50,460
Look, I'll go take a shower

1105
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:53,100
and then I'll be out
of your life, okay?

1106
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,780
I'll find you.

1107
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:58,580
Don't make threats while
you're still tied down.

1108
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,499
I'm just saying--

1109
01:12:59,525 --> 01:13:01,660
What do you expect
me to do about it?

1110
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,180
I'm just saying.

1111
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,700
The easiest thing for me to do

1112
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,580
would be to just kill you.

1113
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,380
But I already told you
I'm not going to do that.

1114
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,900
You don't get off
that easy, Jeff.

1115
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,780
I'm sweating
like a pig. Seriously.

1116
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,300
Um...I gotta go have a shower,

1117
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,700
and then when I come back later,
maybe we can chat some more.

1118
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,660
I'm all here.

1119
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,420
I'm all here.

1120
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,940
<i>Why you can see it
with your very own eyes.</i>

1121
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:22,380
Come on. Come on.

1122
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,420
No!

1123
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,340
Fuck.

1124
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,740
Hey, Trace.

1125
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,900
Look, I'm gonna be done, like,
so much sooner than I thought,

1126
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,420
so do you wanna
catch a movie or something?

1127
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,780
Cool.

1128
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,940
No, I'm not telling you.

1129
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,980
Yes, this is Lieutenant
Hayley, L.A.P.D.

1130
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,700
You're acquainted
with a photographer,

1131
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,460
one Jeffrey Kohlver?

1132
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,660
Yes, there's been
an incident here.

1133
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,900
Is it possible that
you can assist us?

1134
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,780
I'm not at liberty to discuss
that at this moment, ma'am,

1135
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,340
but it's a very
delicate matter

1136
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,740
and the sooner we
can speak with you here,

1137
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:46,380
the better chance we have
of keeping it out of the papers.

1138
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,780
We appreciate that.

1139
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:51,420
The address--

1140
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,740
Yes.

1141
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:57,580
Yes, that's the place.

1142
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,980
How soon do you think
you can be here?

1143
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,780
Steady.

1144
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,820
Stand straight.

1145
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,860
Attaboy.

1146
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,220
You're insane.
Right.

1147
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:12,100
Which I did tell you
when we first met, remember?

1148
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,500
"Four out of five
doctors agree..."

1149
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,620
Maybe I should ask
my therapist.

1150
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,340
See what she thinks
about it.

1151
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:23,373
Ask her much it would
cost to get a padded ce--

1152
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,700
Help!

1153
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:32,260
Shut up!

1154
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:35,980
Hi.

1155
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,180
Oh, hello.
Is Mr. Kohlver here?

1156
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:41,380
Um, he's asleep.
Not feeling so well.

1157
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:43,340
I think it's food poisoning.

1158
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,020
I'm sorry to hear that.

1159
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,580
Are you--

1160
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:48,700
I'm his niece.

1161
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,380
Oh, really?

1162
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:54,460
Can I ask you something?

1163
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,580
Okay.

1164
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:58,260
I might be a little
out of line here.

1165
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,580
Do you babysit?

1166
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,620
Yeah, yeah.
I do. I do.

1167
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,300
But I'm only here for, like,
a couple more days.

1168
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,820
Oh, that's too bad.

1169
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:12,300
I'm on a constant patrol
for new babysitters.

1170
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,500
Right.

1171
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,740
Are those--
Oh...

1172
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:18,500
Yes. Mr. Kohlver's cookies.

1173
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,820
My daughter's a Girl Scout

1174
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,620
and we've been trying
to deliver these,

1175
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,100
but we've always been
missing him,

1176
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,500
so here they are,
yummy stuff.

1177
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,380
Thanks.

1178
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:30,420
Yeah. Uncle Jeff loves
his Girl Scouts, so...

1179
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,820
You should probably--
What?

1180
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:37,940
Well, pay me.

1181
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,100
Right. Yeah. I'm sorry.
How much is it?

1182
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,460
Six.
Six.

1183
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,740
Can you just wait here
for a second?

1184
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:50,100
No problem. Sure.

1185
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,180
Here you go.

1186
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:07,100
Did I hear something?

1187
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,860
The food poisoning.
He's... vomiting and...

1188
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,180
I'm so sorry.

1189
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,780
Your cookies.
Thanks.

1190
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:19,220
And if you're going
to be around any longer,

1191
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,700
I'm just-- I'm three
houses down, across.

1192
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,580
I can always, always,
always use a new sitter.

1193
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:27,660
I wish I could, but...
Yeah, me too.

1194
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:28,940
Well...

1195
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,820
So how's the roof?

1196
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,540
S-Sorry?

1197
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,300
You were on the roof.

1198
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,420
I was.

1199
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:42,860
Just a little while ago I was
trimming my roses and looked up

1200
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:46,300
and I saw you there
and I was wondering who it was.

1201
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,900
Ah, yeah, we--
There's, uh..

1202
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,180
We had a leak
and I...

1203
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,860
thought I'd go up and check.

1204
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:57,180
Your uncle made you
go up on the roof?

1205
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,700
Well...

1206
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,500
he's... sick

1207
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,020
and I said I'd go and see
if there's, like--

1208
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,500
A hole or--
Right.

1209
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,420
Did it rain?

1210
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:16,500
I have to go back to my uncle.

1211
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,300
Oh, sure. No problem.

1212
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,860
Just tell him Judy Tokuda
said hello.

1213
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:22,180
You bet.
Okay?

1214
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:23,420
Thanks.

1215
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,180
Well...it's "yummy stuff."

1216
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,540
A leak?

1217
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,620
That's all you could
come up with? Pathetic.

1218
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:39,740
Don't piss me off right
now, Uncle Jeff.

1219
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,540
You know, she'll be back.

1220
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,140
She thinks you're flakey.

1221
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,860
You might need help...
putting it fucking mildly.

1222
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:50,620
When you got loose...

1223
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,540
did you call the police,
did you run for help,

1224
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:54,980
like an innocent
person would?

1225
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,660
I did call.
Oh, yeah?

1226
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:01,660
Why don't we just
press redial and see?

1227
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,740
Face it, Jeff.

1228
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,900
You could have gotten away
and you didn't.

1229
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,660
Now it's so easy.

1230
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:17,900
I leave you here,

1231
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:20,220
someone will find you...

1232
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:23,540
along with the photo of Donna

1233
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:27,060
and the confession that
I typed on your computer.

1234
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,220
Or...

1235
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,940
I have a special time,
limited offer.

1236
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,340
You step off that chair,
you end it all,

1237
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:38,460
I destroy all the evidence.

1238
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,940
No one will ever know
why you killed yourself,

1239
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,740
not even Janelle.

1240
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:45,820
I didn't kill Donna Mauer.

1241
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:48,380
We've been over this.
Fuck you. I'm not gonna beg.

1242
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,380
You mean you're not going
to beg again?

1243
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,380
Because you do it so well.

1244
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:53,900
Please.

1245
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:57,140
Please, pretty please,

1246
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:58,740
with a cherry on top.

1247
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,820
One that you just had to pop.

1248
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,940
You'll leave a clue.

1249
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,060
You've messed up
once already,

1250
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,700
more than once.

1251
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:13,980
Mrs. Tokuda's made you.

1252
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,260
She's figured you out.

1253
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,700
They'll find you.

1254
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,260
They might.
No. They will.

1255
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:24,580
You'll spend the rest of your
life lookin' over your shoulder.

1256
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,820
Waking up, in the middle
of the night,

1257
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:29,700
jumping at every noise.

1258
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:37,660
How hard do you think they're
going to look for me, really?

1259
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:40,060
I mean, they find
a pedophile killer,

1260
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,420
all gift wrapped for them.

1261
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,500
Think they're gonna care
who did the work?

1262
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,620
Think they're even
gonna bring it up?

1263
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:49,900
And I will have the biggest
legal defense you ever saw.

1264
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:53,540
If everyone who's ever
molested sends me $5,

1265
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:55,500
oh, come on, I'll be
able to afford

1266
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,740
the best fucking lawyer
in the world.

1267
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,860
Worst case scenario:

1268
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:04,340
two years of community service?

1269
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,940
Jody Foster directs the movie
version of the whole thing.

1270
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,780
Who do you want to play you?

1271
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,940
You didn't leave, did ya?

1272
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,820
No.

1273
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:14,660
You don't wanna
leave me...

1274
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,700
do ya?

1275
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,660
Where are ya?

1276
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:32,940
We've spent too much time
only to walk away.

1277
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,420
I know you're not gonna leave.

1278
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,220
Come on!

1279
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,300
I'll make it good for you,
I promise!

1280
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,380
Oh, you're good.

1281
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,020
You're so fucking good!

1282
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,300
You're just like her!

1283
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,460
You're all just fucking
like her!

1284
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:35,660
You wanna drive a man
fucking crazy,

1285
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:38,140
then go ahead, until you go out
of your fucking mind!

1286
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:41,100
Then go-- Go on
your fucking way!

1287
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,420
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1288
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,780
Go!

1289
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,980
You're right.

1290
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:53,740
You're right, Hayley.

1291
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,340
Thank you. Thank you.

1292
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,060
This is me.

1293
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:01,180
This is who I am.

1294
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,340
Thank you.

1295
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,220
Thank you for
helping me see it.

1296
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,020
What took you so long?

1297
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,420
You dropped this.
I had to.

1298
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:57,772
Yeah?

1299
01:29:57,798 --> 01:29:59,180
You would have been
down there forever.

1300
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,540
Were you jerkin' off?

1301
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:03,132
Which do you wanna fuck
first, me or the knife?

1302
01:30:03,158 --> 01:30:03,780
Uh-uh.

1303
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:07,820
You know how to use that?
Honor student, remember?

1304
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,940
Nothing I can't do
when I put my mind to it.

1305
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,620
Toss the knife in the backyard!

1306
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:18,740
Why?

1307
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,860
Or you'll shoot again?
Go on, shoot me.

1308
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:22,380
You're not gonna shoot me!

1309
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:25,500
It's not me you have to worry
about. It's Janelle.

1310
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,460
I called her.

1311
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:32,460
Told her I was Lieutenant Hayley
from the L.A.P.D.

1312
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,140
How far does she live, Jeff?

1313
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,700
Look over there.

1314
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:41,180
Look over there!

1315
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,500
The deal's still open.

1316
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,940
You put the noose around your
neck, you end this whole game.

1317
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,300
I will still clean up
all the evidence.

1318
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,500
You're running out of time!

1319
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:59,820
Or we can wait for her.

1320
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:04,220
I'll pull off my clothes,

1321
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:07,460
and I will run into her arms.

1322
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,340
What? Unless I hang myself?

1323
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:14,780
I'll find you.
I'll track you down!

1324
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,460
Assuming you knew
anything about me.

1325
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:18,300
Calabasas girl
who's dad teaches at UCW

1326
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,660
shouldn't be
that hard to find.

1327
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,780
You believed all that? Huh?

1328
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,860
Who are you?

1329
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,620
It's hard to say for sure.

1330
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:35,060
Maybe not a Calabasas girl.

1331
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:37,340
Maybe not the daughter
of a med school professor.

1332
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:40,940
Maybe not even a friend of Donna Mauer.
Maybe not even named Hayley.

1333
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:48,340
Who the hell are you?

1334
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:54,060
I am every little girl
you ever watched...

1335
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,900
touched, hurt,

1336
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:00,780
screwed, killed.

1337
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:19,700
She's gonna find it, Jeff.
No.

1338
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,180
She's gonna find it all.

1339
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:24,380
Put on the noose
and jump and I'll stop it.

1340
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:29,460
She'll never find out.

1341
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,860
She'll just think
you were some sad man

1342
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,980
who she never
should have left.

1343
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:37,180
Jeff?

1344
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,340
Bad things--

1345
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,060
Fucking awful things

1346
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,260
will happen to you in prison.
This is the only way.

1347
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,660
You'll wish you'd
killed yourself

1348
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:53,020
when you had the chance;
it's the only way.

1349
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,860
It's the only way, Jeff.

1350
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:05,500
Jeff!

1351
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,340
I didn't kill her.

1352
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:30,060
I just watched.

1353
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,780
I wanted to take pictures...

1354
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:38,380
but he wouldn't let me.

1355
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,100
It was me and another guy.

1356
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:43,140
I didn't do it. I swear.

1357
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:44,900
I'll tell you the name,

1358
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:47,180
and I'll help you find him.

1359
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,780
I'll help you find him.

1360
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,340
I know his name.

1361
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:58,140
I know his name, Jeff.

1362
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:03,100
You know what's funny?

1363
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:08,660
Jeff?

1364
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:13,860
Aaron told me you did it
before he killed himself.

1365
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:21,260
It was him. It wasn't me.

1366
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,380
Jeff.

1367
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:28,060
I don't care.

1368
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,220
Jeff?

1369
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:28,260
Don't worry.

1370
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,540
I promise I'll take
care of it all.

1371
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:01,820
Or not.
