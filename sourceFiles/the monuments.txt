1
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,437
Claude.

2
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,557
Put these clothes on.

3
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,767
Take only the back roads.

4
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,410
The Germans are coming from the
east, so head south to Brussels.

5
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,192
- Yes, Father.
- God be with you, Claude.

6
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,064
Champagne... very nice.

7
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,562
You must join me, Doctor Stahl.

8
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,525
- Get another glass.
- With pleasure.

9
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,406
Claire?

10
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,787
We need another champagne glass.

11
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,106
It's for Stahl.

12
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,072
This one... and this one...

13
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,571
to Carinhall.

14
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:36,381
And this will be a present for
the Fuhrer in Berchtesgaden.

15
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,426
What else, Doctor Stahl?

16
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,830
This is da Vinci's <i>Last Supper.</i>

17
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,753
The British bombers leveled
three walls and a roof.

18
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:20,178
This is Monte Cassino, founded
in 529 by Saint Benedict.

19
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,930
This is in February.

20
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,637
This is Monte Cassino in March,

21
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,350
after we dropped 20 tons
of explosives on it.

22
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,809
Mr. President, the simple fact is
that we are at a point in this war

23
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,151
that is most dangerous to the greatest
historical achievements known to man.

24
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,363
But, Professor Stokes,
understand that this is war.

25
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,243
And that lives are lost,

26
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,997
and with them, oftentimes,
their greatest achievements.

27
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,784
Yes, sir. There's something more.

28
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,080
This is the <i>Ghent Altarpiece.</i>

29
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,629
It is the defining monument
of the Catholic Church.

30
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,262
We now know that the
Nazis have stolen it.

31
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,139
Now, while we must and we
will, sir, win this war,

32
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,552
we should also remember the
high price that will be paid

33
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,097
if the very foundation of
modern society is destroyed.

34
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,562
Let's look at where we are now.

35
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,237
The Russians are here.

36
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,569
The Allies are here

37
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,608
and here.

38
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,871
In the next few months, God willing,
we are all going to end up in Berlin.

39
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,578
Meaning that we will have
blasted our way west,

40
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,869
through Poland, through
Hungary, through Austria,

41
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:38,290
north through Rome and Florence,

42
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,336
and east through Paris.

43
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,175
Then the question must be asked:

44
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,851
Who would make sure that the
<i>Statue of David</i> is still standing,

45
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,975
or that <i>Mona Lisa's</i> still smiling?

46
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,769
Who would be their protectors?

47
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,778
Well, professor, it's a
very compelling argument.

48
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,983
What would you suggest?

49
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,782
<i>I suggest you pull together
young art scholars</i>

50
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,036
<i>to get over there and
identify the great works.</i>

51
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,164
<i>Our young art scholars are
already over there fighting.</i>

52
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,500
<i>You have a family?</i>

53
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,253
<i>I have a wife and a young son.</i>

54
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,878
<i>I might be asking a great
deal of you, then.</i>

55
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,090
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

56
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,984
There's a Michelangelo
joke to be made.

57
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,983
You're just the man to make it.

58
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,692
You hungry?

59
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,152
You buying?

60
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,113
Uncle Sam is.

61
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,709
<i>- How's Penny?
- She's swell.</i>

62
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,217
- I do question her taste.
- So does she.

63
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,093
How's the ticker?

64
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,012
Still ticking.

65
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,265
Want to get in the war?

66
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,184
"The Monuments Men."

67
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,472
- Signed by Roosevelt.
- I see that.

68
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,812
I'm to put a team together and
try to protect what's left,

69
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,521
and find what's missing.

70
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,528
- Aren't you a little old for that?
- Yes.

71
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,321
You want to go into a war
zone and tell our boys

72
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,532
- what they can and cannot blow up.
- That's the idea.

73
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,243
- Okay. How many men?
- For now, six.

74
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,952
- Jesus.
- Mm.

75
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,619
- With you, that's seven.
- That's much better.

76
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,380
We'll go through basic in Shrivenham,
England, then wait for orders.

77
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,665
- Basic?
- Mm-hm.

78
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,086
Basic training. Us?

79
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,388
Oh, boy.

80
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,925
You're gonna need a
point man in England.

81
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,093
- Yeah, Donald Jeffries.
- He's a drunk.

82
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,604
- You're a drunk.
- That's true. Pass me that.

83
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,016
- But isn't Donald Jeffries in jail?
- No, he didn't go to jail.

84
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,150
- His father paid the money back.
- Mm.

85
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,437
How about his wife?
Did she stick it out?

86
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,605
No, nobody stuck it out.

87
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,327
So when do we start?

88
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,404
- Good to see you! Frank. James.
- Donald.

89
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,156
The chaps are all very
anxious to get started.

90
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,818
You're a lieutenant?
They are getting desperate.

91
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,284
Don't let Churchill hear that.
James, how's your lovely wife?

92
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,791
Fine. She told me to send you a
kiss, which I won't deliver.

93
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,747
- I'll just shake.
- You usually do.

94
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,586
Not anymore. I'm on the wagon.

95
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,418
- Since when?
- Nine this morning.

96
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,048
Congratulations.

97
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,287
Thank you, private.

98
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,589
This is Private Epstein,
from New Jersey.

99
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,152
You don't say. Whereabouts?

100
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,631
Newark. But really the north side.

101
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,925
- Of Newark?
- Yes, sir. The north side.

102
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,809
- That's what I thought.
- Indeed.

103
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,312
- I was born in Germany.
- The north side.

104
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,315
- How are the fellas making out?
- Like Olympians.

105
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,521
Yes, sir.

106
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,654
We have your architect from
Chicago, Sergeant Richard Campbell.

107
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,032
And we have a Frenchman,
Lieutenant Jean-Claude Clermont,

108
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:42,446
director of design at the Chalet
School of Fine Arts before the war.

109
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,824
- Is Preston here?
- Private Preston Savitz.

110
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,791
Private? That won't
sit well with him.

111
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,293
It doesn't.

112
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,378
Finally we have your sculptor,
Sergeant Walter Garfield.

113
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,214
He's a good egg. I worked with
him on the World War I memorial

114
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,629
- in St. Louis.
- Uh-huh.

115
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,547
Hey, Stokes!

116
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,975
How are you, old boy?

117
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,811
Hey, Walter. How are
they treating you?

118
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,190
Been taking it pretty easy on us.
I think they feel sorry for us old guys.

119
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,272
I don't much fancy
an obstacle course.

120
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,526
It's not so bad.

121
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,861
You're just crawling on your belly while
teenagers shoot blanks over your head.

122
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,616
Well, yes and no.

123
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,869
- How's that?
- Yes, they are teenagers.

124
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,155
- And no?
- They're not blanks.

125
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:30,286
We're meeting up after mess.
Let the other chaps know, will you?

126
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,954
Try not to get shot
in the meantime.

127
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,593
<i>I'm guessing you have all gotten
to know each other by now.</i>

128
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,424
Basic training will do that.

129
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,590
You've been selected by myself
and Lieutenant Jeffries

130
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,054
because we need your
knowledge and skill.

131
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,016
We have been tasked
to find and protect

132
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,307
buildings, monuments, and art.

133
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,475
Private, will you get those lights?

134
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,189
Did you know they were shooting
at us with real bullets?

135
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,777
Yes.

136
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,863
Everyone's favorite dictator.

137
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,907
Age 19, and before his
romantic novel <i>Mein Kampf,</i>

138
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,873
he was a failed art student at the
Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.

139
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,753
- Hitler painted that?
- It's not bad.

140
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,916
- Eh, it's not good.
- This photograph

141
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,801
has been obtained by the OSS.

142
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,258
It's a model of his
planned Fuhrer Museum,

143
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,015
to be built in his hometown
of Linz in Austria.

144
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,428
- Fuhrer Museum?
- It'd be one of the biggest in the world.

145
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,346
Gonna take a lot of
art to fill that up.

146
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,604
Exactly right.

147
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,984
We already know he's stealing art from
Amsterdam, Warsaw, and from Paris.

148
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,317
The French are hiding it, the
Germans are finding and taking it.

149
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,027
This is why Hitler
didn't bomb Paris.

150
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,858
He bombed London.

151
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,743
Yes, I know.

152
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,654
Have they started building?

153
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,948
No. That's the point.

154
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,085
They're stealing the art
and hiding it somewhere.

155
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,214
We think they're hiding it in homes
in this area and towards the east.

156
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,338
Our boys are in Normandy
giving them hell,

157
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,426
so that means it's our turn next,
over the Channel and into France.

158
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,053
When?

159
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,264
- Soon.
- We're gonna start with James.

160
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,521
He has a friend in Paris,
director of the National Museum.

161
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,853
- If he's still alive.
- If he's alive, he'll have some idea

162
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,486
where the French art has been hidden.
We need that information.

163
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,444
Lieutenant, you'll cross
the Channel to Deauville.

164
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,325
A contact named Emile
will get you into Paris.

165
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,279
Well, it's a good thing
I'm fluent in French.

166
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,913
Do we get to kill anybody?

167
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,326
I don't know about you guys,
but I'd like to kill somebody.

168
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,917
- You want to shoot Hitler, private?
- I wouldn't mind it.

169
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,166
And Richard, if you call me "private"
again, I will take a shot at you.

170
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,880
Okay, so that's it.

171
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,550
<i>We'll ship out in
the next few days.</i>

172
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,387
<i>Although the war is coming to an
end, it isn't any less dangerous.</i>

173
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,474
<i>So walk carefully,
take no undue chances.</i>

174
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,857
<i>And remember that your lives are
more important than a piece of art.</i>

175
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,564
Sarge, can you tell us where
to find command and control?

176
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,274
- Just got here?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,032
Top brass command post is about
a quarter-mile that way, past K.P.

178
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,533
Thanks!

179
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,073
What?

180
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,457
- If you'd read the orders...
- I don't give a shit.

181
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,169
The orders say, "Don't knock
out old buildings..."

182
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,208
- To be fair...
- Do not interrupt me!

183
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,677
If you think I'll write
home to some kid's mom

184
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:13,512
saying her boy's dead because we couldn't
take out a church tower, I will not.

185
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,472
So have at it.

186
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,683
Anything else?

187
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,899
No, sir.

188
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,900
I think that went well.

189
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,910
Looks like we're walking.

190
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,946
Don't stand there.

191
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,736
Come in.

192
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,846
What are you doing here?

193
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,626
Looking for you.

194
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,954
Sit down.

195
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,847
Do you know why I'm here?

196
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:40,307
- Mm.
- You have a brother. Peter, yes?

197
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,807
Yes, you do.

198
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,192
Are you close?

199
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,696
He's my brother.

200
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,617
Why didn't you tell me he
fought for the Resistance?

201
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,987
He doesn't.

202
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,869
He doesn't now.
He was shot this morning.

203
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,704
He was trying to steal a truck.

204
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,912
A truck filled with
artwork going to Germany.

205
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,455
And he was shot dead.

206
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,262
How do you think he
knew about that truck?

207
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,518
You see, Claire,

208
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,016
because you know the museum,

209
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,687
all the collectors, the art,

210
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,696
you have a value to me.

211
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,492
And yet I have no doubt that if I
were to search this apartment,

212
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,325
I'd find things that would make
our working together impossible.

213
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,491
Shall I?

214
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,368
Do as you wish.

215
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,668
I will.

216
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,964
If I find you interfering,
you won't be fired.

217
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,346
You'll be handed over to the SS.
Is that clear to you?

218
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,898
- I want his body.
- Then swim to the bottom of the Seine.

219
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,131
Granger?

220
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,923
Worried was me for minute.

221
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:42,634
I thought maybe Vichy were
you or I was wrong spot.

222
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,394
You speak English?

223
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,975
- Yes.
- Speak English.

224
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,389
Okay.

225
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,695
Is there a chance of getting
a ride into Lisieux?

226
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,527
Not a chance, lieutenant.

227
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,442
- Any luck finding some radios?
- No, sir.

228
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,454
You got Lucky Strikes, hash,
a pair of boots, size 11.

229
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,364
- What size are you?
- Nine.

230
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,585
Hey, Sam!

231
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,721
Hey, Sam! Epstein, hey!

232
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,678
- Hey!
- Hey, lieutenant!

233
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,844
Hey, you are a sight for sore eyes.
What are you driving?

234
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,436
- Nazis were in hurry, left a few things.
- I'm glad you didn't get left on the beach.

235
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,896
I got pulled when they
found I spoke German.

236
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,688
- What are you, a translator?
- No, I'm nothing till we get to Germany.

237
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,356
That's too bad.

238
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,404
Who's your CO?

239
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,181
Hey, private?

240
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,927
- I'm looking for Major Feilding.
- Yes, sir. Just over here.

241
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,437
- Major Feilding, sir!
- Stokes.

242
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,475
- Hey, John, how are you?
- I wasn't sure we'd find you.

243
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,268
I had to hitch a ride.
What have you got?

244
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,692
Look at this. I think
this fellow's a Monet.

245
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,778
- That's a Vermeer.
- That's why I asked for you.

246
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:26,242
We took a convoy of Germans hotfooting it out
of Vernon. A dozen crates filled with these.

247
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,162
- A dozen paintings?
- A dozen crates.

248
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,827
Sometimes 30 paintings inside.

249
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,164
Can I talk to those Germans?

250
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,877
I don't know. Can you?

251
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,968
Ask them where they
got the paintings.

252
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,097
Are there any more
trucks like these?

253
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,430
Ask them again.

254
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,448
- Take care.
- Good luck.

255
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,117
He said they were going
to a town called Siegen.

256
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,285
Five truckloads were
taken from this area.

257
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,499
Five truckloads.

258
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,836
- Did he say that?
- No, he said it.

259
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,845
He is their commander.
They switch uniforms.

260
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,721
Goddamn.

261
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:33,221
When I see Hitler, I'll be
sure to give him your best...

262
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,230
Captain.

263
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,333
My family were home builders...

264
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,837
my father, his father.

265
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,915
I wanted a simpler life.

266
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,253
Yeah.

267
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,803
It is noble when work in dirt.

268
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,763
You know, James, your
French is not good.

269
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,801
Where did you learn it?

270
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,686
Here and there.

271
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,815
- I studied in Canada for a while.
- Canada?

272
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,692
- Montreal.
- Oh, no, no.

273
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,542
I see you, Stahl!

274
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,220
Where will you hide?

275
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,550
I see you!

276
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,292
Hey, fellas. Look what we found.

277
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,923
- You remember Sam from Newark.
- Hey, sport.

278
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,584
We got ourselves a translator.

279
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,568
I think he wanted my car.

280
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,870
- Where's Campbell?
- Savitz shot him.

281
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,510
<i>So now we know it's not
random, it's systematic.</i>

282
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,100
<i>Every one of those paintings
is a masterpiece.</i>

283
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:25,067
They're all headed to the
town of Siegen in Germany.

284
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,694
The Nazis are on the run, but
they've taken everything with them,

285
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,700
so we have to get as close
to the front as we can.

286
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,951
Preston,

287
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,488
you and Campbell head
towards Belgium.

288
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,453
Specifically, Ghent.

289
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,165
- What's in Ghent?
- It used to be the <i>Altarpiece.</i>

290
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,297
- They took the <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i>?
- I'll go with Garfield.

291
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:50,756
No, Garfield, you and Jean-Claude

292
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:55,219
get as close to Germany as you
can, to the city of Aachen.

293
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,973
We'll leave in the morning.

294
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,510
Why don't you take Sam
from Newark with you,

295
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,976
and I'll head up to my old
stomping ground, Bruges?

296
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,604
There's a <i>Madonna</i> there I
used to see when I was young.

297
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,691
Looks like we're gonna
be together, buddy.

298
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,444
These are German,
but they might fit.

299
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,159
That one will do just fine.

300
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,244
Watch this.

301
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,914
Any news of Granger?

302
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:30,504
Well, word is they liberated Paris,
so we should know something soon.

303
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,672
Turn that knob right there.

304
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,762
- Well, I'll be blowed.
- See, I'm not just a pretty face.

305
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,180
How's it going, Edison?

306
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,974
Would you take that radio
over there to the boys?

307
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,859
- Let's see if this damn thing works.
- You bet.

308
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,446
Frank, I wanted to say thanks.

309
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,493
For what?

310
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,321
For another chance.

311
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,245
Donnie, we've all screwed
up on some level.

312
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,376
Yours was just...

313
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,878
Just at a high level.

314
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,922
You're here because you're
the best man for the job.

315
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,754
Not charity?

316
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,552
Well, a little.

317
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,804
Monuments Men Radio
is about to go live.

318
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,469
I hope we play music.

319
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,889
<i>Calling London, calling London
and all the ships at sea.</i>

320
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,023
We read you loud and clear.

321
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,356
<i>- How far will this thing reach?
- We'll find out tomorrow.</i>

322
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,771
<i>Roger that.</i>

323
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,451
Are all the fellas there?

324
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,578
They are.

325
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,572
<i>All right, listen up, fellas.</i>

326
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,583
<i>I think you should know
the truth as I see it.</i>

327
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,750
This mission was never
designed to succeed.

328
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,415
It's, uh...

329
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,633
If they were honest,
they would tell us that.

330
00:28:55,984 --> 00:29:00,009
<i>They'd tell us that with this many
people dying, who cares about art?</i>

331
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,892
They're wrong, because that's
exactly what we're fighting for,

332
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:08,101
for our culture and
for our way of life.

333
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,272
You can wipe out a
generation of people,

334
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,735
you can burn their homes to the ground,
and somehow they'll still come back.

335
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:22,157
But if you destroy their
achievements and their history,

336
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,205
then it's like they never existed.

337
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,701
Just ash floating.

338
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,254
<i>That's what Hitler wants.</i>

339
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,592
<i>And it's the one thing
we simply can't allow.</i>

340
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,177
I'll see you in the morning.

341
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,306
Now I'm depressed.

342
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,276
I want to make a toast.

343
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,812
Uh-oh.

344
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,823
Um, I think you fellas are...

345
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,162
And I'm proud to be
a Monuments Man.

346
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:16,124
When this all broke out, I wanted to
be a flier pilot... A fighter pilot.

347
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,968
But I got bad eyes,
my hearing is not good.

348
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,548
Right here is the only
way I get into this war.

349
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,514
Now, I'm not some
New York socialite,

350
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,601
I haven't won any awards
like all of you, but...

351
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,858
But I'm guessing you feel the same.

352
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,944
This is our time.

353
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,406
My country thanks you,
and I thank you.

354
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,158
Screw the Germans.

355
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,361
Present company expected.

356
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,496
To the Monuments Men.

357
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,209
- To the Monuments.
- To the Monuments Men.

358
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,875
<i>You have children?</i>

359
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,129
Two, yeah. A 12-year-old
and a 9-year-old.

360
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,840
- Boy and girl?
- Two girls.

361
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,380
- Two girls, hmm.
- Heh-heh, I know.

362
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,760
I know.

363
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,550
I have a boy.

364
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,179
A 17-year-old boy. He's, uh...

365
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,191
He's with the Resistance
up in the north.

366
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,646
In the north?

367
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,484
- Yeah.
- Rough up there.

368
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,398
Yeah, it's rough.

369
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,329
Hard times.

370
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,538
Yeah, hard times.

371
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,214
You like to fly?

372
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,284
Paris!

373
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,790
Pareee!

374
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,810
Am I late?

375
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,555
- By about four years.
- Ha-ha-ha.

376
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,974
- How are you, James?
- Hello, René.

377
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,313
How much of the art did you save?

378
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,228
The national collection is safe.

379
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,399
But the private collections,
they are all gone.

380
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,317
All the private collectors?

381
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,579
All the private Jewish collectors,
by decree, are illegitimate.

382
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,865
Goering used this place to shop.

383
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,325
And take them where?

384
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,086
Germany. To their homes.

385
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,497
Well, René,

386
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,339
the U.S. Army would like
to help you get them back.

387
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,090
I'm happy to hear you say that.

388
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,804
Where do we start?

389
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,844
Claire Simone.

390
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,116
Claire Simone?

391
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:43,497
Hoping was I to speak about art...

392
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,091
the stolen art.

393
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,252
Yeah?

394
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:58,225
I'd like to forcefully introduce
myself. I am James Granger...

395
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:03,525
and I'm the curator of
Medieval art at the Met...

396
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,730
New York.

397
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,486
I know who you are.

398
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:11,242
Then you know I'd like to help.

399
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,867
I know nothing.

400
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,412
And will you stop
speaking in French?

401
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,948
Or whatever language
you are speaking.

402
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,286
Well, if it weren't for us,
you'd be speaking German.

403
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:28,001
No. If it wasn't for
you, I might be dead.

404
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,794
But I would still
be speaking French.

405
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,924
- Okay.
- So,

406
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,558
- how can I help you steal our stolen art?
- That's not why I'm here.

407
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,350
- I'm here to help you get it back.
- Yes, to fill your museum.

408
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,521
I'm told you were at the Jeu de
Paume during the occupation.

409
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,775
- I was.
- I'm interested in what you saw there.

410
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:57,537
Goering came more than 20 times,
you know, took whatever he wanted.

411
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,039
Where did they take them?

412
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,746
- Who knows?
- I think you do know.

413
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,955
Ah.

414
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,791
You've been speaking with Rene.

415
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,997
Were you there the whole time?

416
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,588
Of course. I'm a collaborator.
Haven't you heard?

417
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,720
I helped the Germans steal our art.

418
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,596
And that's why you're here?

419
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,762
What do you think?

420
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,347
I think you worked
with the Resistance.

421
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,979
And I think I can convince
them to let you out.

422
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,810
Why?

423
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,226
Do you know where
the art was taken?

424
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,612
Who's asking?
The curator of the Met?

425
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,322
We put all of the panels in a
truck, sent it to Brussels

426
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,742
with two priests. But the Germans
found them and took them.

427
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,626
May I speak to the priests?

428
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,913
They were shot.

429
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:56,051
If we're gonna find it, we'll have to jump
ahead of the Third Army into Germany.

430
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,886
Number one priority, Preston.
You understand?

431
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,971
The Nazis can't keep it.

432
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,894
<i>We'll find it.</i>

433
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,680
I know you will.

434
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,395
<i>- Keep your head down.</i>
- Will do.

435
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,980
<i>It says the Altarpiece</i>

436
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,488
is one of the most
desired pieces of art.

437
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,648
How'd you read all that?

438
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,868
- It's in English.
- Yeah, I know that.

439
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,655
I just wasn't actually
aware you could read.

440
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,921
Psst!

441
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,506
Easy.

442
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,594
So, Sam, when did
you leave Germany?

443
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,186
1938. Yeah, I was 13.

444
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,067
- Did your family go with you?
- Yeah, my parents.

445
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,274
My grandfather stayed behind.

446
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,565
- What city?
- Karlsruhe.

447
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,530
Yeah, you know, there's
a famous museum there.

448
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,070
Had one of Rembrandt's
self-portraits.

449
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,036
See? You were born to
be a Monuments Man.

450
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,452
- I've never seen that painting.
- No, me neither.

451
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,454
We weren't allowed.

452
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,500
My grandfather would tell me it
was because we were too short.

453
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,386
And then war broke out,

454
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,886
and all of Europe was
too short for Hitler.

455
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,643
Have you heard from
your grandfather?

456
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,850
No, not for four years.

457
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,565
He was taken away.

458
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,110
- Away where?
- Dachau.

459
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,454
Hey, how does that work?

460
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,925
What's going on?

461
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,184
This seems to be a
bit of a problem.

462
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,893
A bit.

463
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,904
Here's a thought.

464
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,192
We put down our guns.

465
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,944
You go your way.

466
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,576
We go our way.

467
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,081
No hard feelings.

468
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,539
He doesn't speak any English.

469
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,048
Not a word.

470
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,550
Okay.

471
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,630
You're just going to sit down?

472
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,845
Yeah, why don't we all
just sit down for a sec?

473
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,635
Okay.

474
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,386
All right.

475
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,685
Shh, shh, shh.

476
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,939
Okay.

477
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,970
I don't smoke.

478
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,475
- Take a cigarette.
- I don't smoke.

479
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,685
Take a goddamn cigarette.

480
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,735
Mm.

481
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,356
John Wayne.

482
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,193
John Wayne.

483
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,706
Shouldn't we have arrested
him or something?

484
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,042
He's not going anywhere.

485
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,378
What was taken?

486
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,711
The bust of Charlemagne, the
shrine holding the robe of Mary.

487
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,966
Okay. How far east?

488
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,799
I heard one commandant
mention the town of Merkers.

489
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,714
- Merkers?
- Sir, please... we have no quarrel with you.

490
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,431
- And we have none with you.
- Let us have them back, don't keep them.

491
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,640
Father...

492
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,849
Look out!

493
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,741
Okay.

494
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,491
So one of us has to distract him,

495
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,451
the other one takes him out.

496
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,916
Sounds like a good plan.

497
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,994
All right.

498
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,079
Okay, I'll take him out.

499
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,417
I'll take him out.

500
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,423
- You have a family.
- So do you.

501
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,470
Okay, you go distract and
I'll take care of business.

502
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,681
All right.

503
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,726
I've never shot anyone before.

504
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,934
- It's easy.
- Have you?

505
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,195
I'm about to.

506
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:50,530
Okay, I'll shoot, you go.

507
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,345
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

508
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,524
Shit.

509
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,446
- Maybe we keep this to ourselves.
- I think that's best.

510
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,959
Good evening. Where's your CO?

511
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,088
Colonel Langton, sir.
I'll take you to him. Follow me.

512
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,624
I'm hoping to speak
to Colonel Langton.

513
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,335
Langton here, lieutenant.

514
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,425
Donald Jeffries. How do you do?
Do you have a moment?

515
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,306
Can I tempt you with a cognac?

516
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,843
You could easily tempt
me, but no, thank you.

517
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,636
Are you bringing us bad news?

518
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:45,022
Not at all, sir, no. I was
simply hoping to get into town.

519
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,899
- What town, Bruges? Why?
- Bruges.

520
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,562
Colonel, my job is to protect art,
so that when this war is over,

521
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,696
there will still be some, you see.

522
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,280
In a cathedral in Bruges is
Michelangelo's <i>Madonna and Child,</i>

523
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,446
his only sculpture to leave
Italy during his lifetime.

524
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:03,492
And if it can be helped, I'd like to
see it still standing there tomorrow.

525
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,707
You do have an unusual
job, lieutenant.

526
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,839
There is some good news.
We're not going into Bruges.

527
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,920
We've made a deal with the mayor.

528
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,720
We won't attack the city and
the Germans are leaving.

529
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,972
We'll resume fighting
outside Bruges.

530
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,142
If we catch them.
They're running at a fair clip.

531
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,519
Have you seen this, colonel?

532
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,855
The Germans destroyed Florence
when they pulled out.

533
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,732
They'll do the same to Bruges.

534
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,236
No, lieutenant, they're not.
This isn't Italy.

535
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,365
The war is ending. These
Germans just want to get home.

536
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,777
They've not destroyed any French
villages. They're on the run.

537
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:42,914
- If you could let me have two guards...
- The Germans don't have the time.

538
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,201
They don't have the explosives,
or even the damn tanks.

539
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:50,372
No, I will not risk a street-to-street
battle. We will honor our agreement.

540
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:54,634
When we get to Bruges, you can finish
your job in the cathedral. Understood?

541
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,428
I understand.

542
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,548
Is there anything else?

543
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,385
No, sir. Thank you.

544
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,297
Any of you speak English?

545
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,005
Are you Catholic, lieutenant?

546
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,173
I am tonight.

547
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,094
<i>Dear Father.</i>

548
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:15,313
<i>Weep you might when you hear of my
many adventures with these fine men.</i>

549
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,978
<i>It would remind you of our
treasure hunts when I was a boy.</i>

550
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,065
<i>But rather than a whistle or a top,</i>

551
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,986
<i>our prizes are
Rembrandts and Rubens.</i>

552
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,503
<i>It feels odd that in a
place with so much death,</i>

553
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,210
<i>I've never felt more alive.</i>

554
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,926
<i>My thoughts soar with the tales</i>

555
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,839
<i>these streets could tell of the
Madonna's long journey to Paris</i>

556
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,384
<i>and her triumphant return
with the fall of Napoleon.</i>

557
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,980
<i>You can see her porcelain hand
gently holding the small boy</i>

558
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:58,609
<i>as if to guard him from a
fate she knew would come.</i>

559
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:16,203
<i>I know in a time of war my endeavor
must seem small, and perhaps it is.</i>

560
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,542
<i>But I remain diligent and
resolute in my belief</i>

561
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:23,835
<i>that great works of art can never
belong to any one individual.</i>

562
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,423
<i>At least not in spirit.</i>

563
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,928
<i>The Madonna is as much
mine as it was Napoleon's.</i>

564
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:39,435
<i>And her hand gently guards me
from a fate I know will come.</i>

565
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,411
<i>Father, I know I've been
a great disappointment.</i>

566
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,079
<i>In defense of the indefensible,</i>

567
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:03,796
<i>my crimes were qualities I found
in the bottom of a bottle,</i>

568
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,052
<i>not actions bent on hurting you.</i>

569
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,488
<i>I long for the chance</i>

570
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:34,406
<i>to be back on that pedestal
you so proudly placed me.</i>

571
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:39,127
<i>Perhaps here
I can make you proud again.</i>

572
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,959
<i>Here at the foot of our Madonna.</i>

573
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:45,671
<i>I am humbled and grateful,</i>

574
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,011
<i>and longing for home</i>

575
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,346
<i>and rest.</i>

576
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,343
<i>I'm in great need of rest.</i>

577
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,145
<i>I'll write when I can.</i>

578
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:02,150
<i>Cheers and Godspeed. Donald.</i>

579
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,872
You'll see to it that
his family gets these?

580
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,533
We will.

581
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,208
Thank you.

582
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:28,259
Lieutenant, I told him not
to go, but he was hell-bent.

583
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:34,053
- And they took the Madonna?
- That's right.

584
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,060
Well, I'd better get her back.

585
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,488
<i>What have you got?</i>

586
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,405
Yeah, the vicar gave us
the town of Merkers.

587
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,665
They might've stored
some pieces there.

588
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,575
<i>- Merkers?</i>
- Yeah.

589
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:06,919
<i>- M-E-R-K-E-R-S. Merkers.</i>
- Got it.

590
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:10,676
<i>- Any word from Granger?</i>
- Nothing yet.

591
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:14,054
All hell's breaking loose here.
They won't let us through.

592
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,133
<i>We're to hold up in St. Vith.</i>

593
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,972
We'll meet you there.

594
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,892
Hell of a thing about Donald.

595
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,184
It's a hell of a thing.

596
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,790
- What is all this?
- People's lives.

597
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,421
What people?

598
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,919
Jews.

599
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,027
They're gone.

600
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,953
You get around.

601
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,964
I'm a spy, remember?

602
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,341
They're not coming back.

603
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:22,141
Well, Claire, my job is to
find art and return it.

604
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,685
And this seems like a
good place to start.

605
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,666

on the side of the road.

632
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,986
He took one in the chest. His leg's
bleeding. We put a tourniquet on it.

633
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,122
Let's get this shirt off
and see how bad it is.

She's afraid we'll keep

664
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,326
The Russians are keeping the art?

665
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,336
<i>They lost 20 million people, Frank.</i>

666
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:46,381
They've commissioned
a trophy brigade

667
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,171
to collect and keep all the stolen art.
To make reparations.

668
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,385
"Trophy brigade." You gotta
love a snappy nickname.

669
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,391
<i>Like Monuments Men?</i>

670
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,138
I got a letter from
Donald's father.

671
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:05,104
Said I should be proud of helping
Donald get his dignity back.

672
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,613
I don't feel very proud.

673
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:14,944
<i>He asked if I found the Madonna.
I don't even know where to look.</i>

674
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,917
We need to know what
Claire knows, James.

675
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,421
I'm close, Frank.

676
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,550
Okay.

677
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,004
And now we got the Russians.

678
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,594
Put the Germans in the truck.

679
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,601
Give them some bread.

680
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,900
Be careful with those paintings.

681
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,649
Touch only the frames.

682
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,618
The frames we can replace.

683
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,716
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

684
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,135
- No.
- It's a directive. The Nero Decree.

685
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,645
It is written by Hitler,
signed by Hitler.

686
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:27,603
It says if he dies or if Germany
falls, they're to destroy everything.

687
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,566
Everything.

688
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,315
Where did they take the art?

689
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,571
Germany.

690
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,825
You understand I'm
here to help you?

691
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,831
I understand you are, but
you are not in Germany.

692
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,413
- My men are.
- I don't know your men.

693
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,670
You'll have to find
somebody to trust.

694
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,956
Yes, James, you tell me who.

695
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,928
What's cooking?

696
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,562
Lice.

697
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,857
- It's called the Nero Decree.
- What?

698
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,110
Granger took it off a train full
of art headed for Germany.

699
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:18,367
It says if Hitler dies, they're to destroy
bridges, train tracks, archives, art.

700
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,617
Jesus.

701
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,995
So we think most of the
art went to Siegen?

702
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,372
We know it went through
Siegen and Merkers.

703
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:27,705
- Lot of art to hide in a couple towns.
- What are you eating?

704
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,540
- Homemade jerky. Want some?
- No.

705
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:33,424
Garfield, let's say you and
Jean-Claude make your way to Merkers.

706
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,626
And then we'll go to Siegen.

707
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,090
And we have to hope
no one kills Hitler.

708
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,840
I never thought I'd say that.

709
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,059
We'll meet up in Nuremberg.

710
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,016
Oh. Oh, God.

711
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:05,080
Ow.

712
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,749
- That looks really painful.
- It is.

713
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,251
Very painful, yeah.

714
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,832
So you're artists, heh?

715
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:15,124
No, we're collectors from New York.
Yeah, this guy's an architect.

716
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,800
Oh, ha, ha.

717
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,801
I always wanted to see New York.

718
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,258
Greatest city in the world.

719
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:23,389
- Have you ever seen Munich?
- No.

720
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,266
But we will soon.

721
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,895
What did he say? What's that?

722
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,397
He said not to make me angry.

723
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,739
- Okay, okay. Let's go.
- Ow!

724
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,833
I... I have a nephew who
studied art in Paris.

725
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:54,087
Yeah, he lives a few miles from here.
He may be able to help you.

726
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,622
Is he a soldier?

727
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:59,510
He was a soldier, heh, heh,
like you. But he's a good boy.

728
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,675
Oh. I'm sure you're all innocent.

729
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,389
Okay, okay, Say: Ah!

730
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,043
So how long were you in Paris?

731
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,678
You studied in Paris?

732
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:46,841
Yes, two years.
My wife and I left Paris.

733
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,391
Hmm.

734
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,107
- These are beautiful paintings.
- I wish. Just copies.

735
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,769
Cézanne. Renoir.

736
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,647
They're good.

737
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,824
So where did you study art?

738
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,580
Harvard.

739
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,699
Society for Contemporary Art.

740
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:19,335
They're looking for artifacts. They want
to protect the historic pieces. Huh?

741
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,795
It's an honorable thing
in a time of war.

742
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:26,005
Well, we think the SS took
the great pieces of art

743
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,970
out through France
and are hiding it.

744
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:34,646
Yeah, I told them you may be
able to help, Hermann. Huh?

745
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,690
Well, I wasn't SS. I was
a soldier, like you.

746
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:40,443
If I can help you in any way...

747
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:43,196
Do you know a collector
named Rothschild?

748
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:46,278
- Rothschild.
- Had one of the greatest art collections

749
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,068
- in the world.
- He's French?

750
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,488
- Jewish.
- No. No, I don't know him.

751
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,412
Uh...

752
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,378
Does your wife speak English?

753
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,628
No, no.

754
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,164
Good.

755
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:08,384
The back of the Cézanne

756
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,048
says Rothschild.

757
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,018
It was a gift.

758
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,529
And the Renoir too?

759
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,259
Heil Hitler.

760
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,723
Heil Hitler!

761
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,725
Heil Hitler.

762
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,954
Hey, private.

763
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,369
- Where's Siegen?
- You're in it, lieutenant.

764
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,642
It should be this turn.

765
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,849
Who the hell knows?

766
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,855
It could have been the last one.

767
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,894
If we get to a bell tower,
we've gone too far.

768
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,986
What do you think?

769
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:51,532
I don't think we should go
any further down this road.

770
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,709
Stop, stop, stop. Wait,
wait, stop, stop, stop.

771
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,472
Look at him.

772
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,928
He's a beauty.

773
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,933
He's a runner.

774
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,894
Hey, my friend.

775
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,064
I haven't got a thing for you.

776
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,022
Offer him a cigarette.

777
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,033
You want a cigarette?

778
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,745
I guess he doesn't smoke.

779
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,789
Jean-Claude?

780
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,448
Aah!

781
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:08,995
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

782
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:12,166
I'm shot! Where am I hit?

783
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,425
Jesus Christ.

784
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,845
I'm bleeding like a son of a bitch.

785
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,307
Dumb-ass way to get killed.

786
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,226
Shit, merde!

787
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,819
Help! Help me!

788
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:36,193
Please!

789
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,278
<i>When we first started this mission,</i>

790
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:39,613
<i>there was some question</i>

791
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,780
<i>as to whether we could really
call ourselves soldiers.</i>

792
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,825
<i>Were we risking as much as these
young men fighting and dying?</i>

793
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,164
<i>And I suppose it was fair to ask.</i>

794
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:53,047
Garfield, hold onto this.
My wife gave it to me.

795
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,924
I don't want to get blood on it.

796
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,716
Jean-Claude, you hang
on to it right now.

797
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:03,433
<i>We are no longer observers to war.</i>

798
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,885
<i>We're active participants,</i>

799
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,898
<i>subject to the same heartache
as the rest of these soldiers.</i>

800
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:22,786
<i>When we lost Donald Jeffries, we
earned the right to wear the uniform.</i>

801
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,414
<i>And now we've lost our second man.</i>

802
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:32,462
<i>From the beginning, I told you that no
piece of art was worth a man's life.</i>

803
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:36,125
<i>But these last months
have proved me wrong.</i>

804
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:41,092
<i>This is our history, and it's
not to be stolen or destroyed.</i>

805
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:46,551
It's to be held up and admired,
as are these brave men.

806
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:51,101
And now we owe it to
them to finish the job.

807
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,565
Walter, head stateside,
get some R&R.

808
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,445
We'll meet up with you later.

809
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,858
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to finish this.

810
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,571
That'd be fine.

811
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,488
All right, let's take a
look at where we are.

812
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:07,701
- Stokes?
- Yeah.

813
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:11,789
I got this off an SS officer.
He was stationed in Paris. It's a map.

814
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,625
He had a farmhouse
full of stolen art.

815
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:19,630
I don't understand. Siegen, Siegen.

816
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:23,592
We were there. There's
nothing there. Merkers.

817
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,431
Merkers.

818
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,805
They're not train routes.

819
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,804
- Are they airfields?
- No.

820
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,347
Bernterode, Salzburg.

821
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,892
Sir, that's not Salzburg.

822
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,528
<i>Salz</i> means "salt."
It's a salt mine.

823
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,320
<i>Kalium</i> is "potassium."

824
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,699
Each town has a symbol next to it.

825
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:51,867
Bernterode is a potassium mine.
Merkers, salt mine.

826
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,876
Altaussee, salt mine.

827
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,083
- Siegen...
- Copper.

828
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,712
Ah.

829
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,258
There's a copper mine in Siegen.

830
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,114
<i>Yesterday we found 16,000
pieces of stolen art</i>

831
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,783
<i>buried in a German copper mine.</i>

832
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:00,999
<i>It seems the Nazis took better care
of paintings than they did people.</i>

833
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,462
<i>There was no sign of the Madonna
that cost Donnie his life,</i>

834
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:08,878
<i>but maybe we'll have better luck in the
next mine, in the town of Merkers.</i>

835
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,054
<i>Enclosed are your transfer orders.</i>

836
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,888
<i>We'll need you here, as we've lost
both Jeffries and Jean-Claude.</i>

837
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,515
<i>Safe travels.</i>

838
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,750
May I offer you a coffee?

839
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,957
Well, I'm not sure.

840
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,798
I almost didn't recognize you.

841
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,754
My hair?

842
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:55,016
No, I've just... I've
never seen you smile.

843
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:59,099
Well, James, it's April in Paris.
Haven't you heard?

844
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:02,978
- They write songs about it.
- Ha, is that so?

845
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,610
Are you shopping for your wife?

846
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:10,273
- For my wife?
- Every woman loves French perfume.

847
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,565
Even French women?

848
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,115
Especially French women.

849
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,247
Do you write to your
wife every day?

850
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,623
No.

851
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,544
But I do write.

852
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,796
Are you a good husband?

853
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,133
I like to think so.

854
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:33,091
Paris at night finds a
lot of good husbands

855
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,722
out.

856
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,516
Well, it's war.

857
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,344
It's Paris, hm?

858
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,938
Sardines.

859
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,314
Crackers.

860
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,191
And some kind of potted meat.

861
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,282
- Are you having a party?
- No.

862
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,242
No, stocking up.

863
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,083
My orders came through last night.

864
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,746
- Mm.
- I'm heading east.

865
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,924
Germany?

866
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:15,054
Merkers. There's a mine there.
That's where I'll meet the men.

867
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,965
I was just reading about your men.

868
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,179
They found art.

869
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,344
A lot of art.

870
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,437
And they returned it.

871
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:28,602
Well, what they could. We still don't
know who a lot of it belongs to.

872
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,274
When do you leave?

873
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,278
I leave in the morning.

874
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,989
Then we should celebrate tonight.

875
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:46,744
This is my address.

876
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:52,257
You bring the potted meat.
I'll bring the wine.

877
01:16:58,072 --> 01:16:59,799
What's the attire?

878
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,514
Formal, of course.

879
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:06,101
Formal, of course.
That's what I thought.

880
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,293
You weren't kidding.

881
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:39,300
Mm. I never kid.

882
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,431
This is the best I have.

883
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,018
Why don't you pour the wine?

884
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,439
I brought some things.
I brought some cheese,

885
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,144
some brie cheese and croissants.

886
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,186
Very French.

887
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,280
I cooked a hen.

888
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:59,157
- A hen?
- Yes.

889
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:02,453
It should be ready soon.

890
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:07,538
Here, put this on.

891
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:13,168
You know, in France,

892
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,425
if you are given an
invitation to a formal party,

893
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,506
you dress accordingly.

894
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:23,341
It matches my eyes.

895
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,477
Then you may keep it.

896
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,149
- Rosenberg. Goering.
- Mmmm.

897
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,061
Lohse. Von Behr.

898
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:38,071
These are the key
figures in the ERR.

899
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,699
The Staff for Special Purposes.

900
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:45,204
They started with the
Jewish collectors in 1940.

901
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,080
You see Stahl?

902
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,912
The SS farmer.

903
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,542
Farmer.

904
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,669
Here he is with Goering.

905
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,923
Inspecting art to be stolen
and shipped to Germany.

906
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,380
Most of the pieces they would
photograph, then take.

907
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:07,518
And they would send Hitler albums
filled with the stolen artwork.

908
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:10,896
And the modern masters, you
know, like Picasso, Klee,

909
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,432
- Yes.
- Max Ernst,

910
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:15,602
were just burned in the yard.

911
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,108
Hundreds of paintings.

912
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:21,570
And you believe these
paintings are in the mines?

913
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,739
No.

914
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,738
No, not these.

915
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:43,174
This is all I have, James.

916
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,973
This is my life.

917
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,260
I understand.

918
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:54,432
This is every piece of art that
came through the Jeu de Paume.

919
01:19:54,832 --> 01:20:00,359
Now, I have kept train manifests,
receipts, letters for every single piece.

920
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:06,319
Who it belonged to, who took
it, where they took it.

921
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:09,910
I kept a colored mark here for
every piece, to match this ledger.

922
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,494
Jesus Christ.

923
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:15,457
I'm giving it to you.

924
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:18,709
It's your responsibility now.

925
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,251
I understand.

926
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:28,428
There's a castle in the
Bavarian Alps, Neuschwanstein.

927
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,135
You should find most
of the art there.

928
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:34,896
Thank you, Claire.

929
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,976
And you tell them Claire Simone
says hello when you get there.

930
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,858
I'll do just that.

931
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:54,288
I am out of wine, but,
uh, I have cognac.

932
01:20:57,144 --> 01:20:58,962
I should go.

933
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,375
You could stay.

934
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:11,509
It's Paris, you know?

935
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:43,336
I do love my tie.

936
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,420
Say, fellas.

937
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,925
Well, hello!

938
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,757
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, sir.

939
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:33,049
- Good to see you.
- How was vacation?

940
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,759
Ha. Where's Stokes?

941
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:59,116
She's not here, is she?

942
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:03,754
Who?

943
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,377
The <i>Madonna.</i>

944
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,377
Not here, not in Siegen.

945
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:12,137
She'll turn up.

946
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,014
I'm not so sure.

947
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:20,513
Donald was so proud of
what we're doing here.

948
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,517
He was proud to be a part of it.

949
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,523
There will never be a
thousand-year Reich.

950
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,816
No Fatherland.

951
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,245
No Fuhrer Museum.

952
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:42,751
If Jean-Claude and Donald had
something to do with that, well,

953
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,332
I guess it's okay.

954
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,717
I just have some
unfinished business.

955
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,377
We'll find her.

956
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,716
Yeah.

957
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,890
He really wanted it all.

958
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,393
He wanted everything.

959
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:14,033
- Private, what does that sign say?
- Uh, "storage."

960
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:17,737
- See if there are any lanterns in there.
- Yes, sir.

961
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:38,973
You okay in there?

962
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,517
Sam?

963
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,313
<i>Buried some 1200 feet</i>

964
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,816
<i>below the ground in a salt
mine in Merkers, Germany,</i>

965
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,979
<i>our Gls discovered over
100 tons of gold bullion,</i>

966
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,318
<i>the entirety of Germany's reserve.</i>

967
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,575
<i>A crushing blow to Hitler.
Grand news indeed,</i>

968
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:43,240
<i>and congratulations to generals
Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower.</i>

969
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,205
The Army may not
care much about art,

970
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,416
but they sure as shit
care about gold.

971
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:58,303
General Patton, what are you
gonna do with the gold?

972
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:06,394
- Private, give me a hand.
- Yes, sir.

973
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,558
I don't think you've been
properly introduced.

974
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:15,358
Sam, that's your neighbor,
Mr. Rembrandt.

975
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,159
You tell your grandfather
when you see him.

976
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,116
Nice to meet you.

977
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,584
Hey, got us a couple of trucks.

978
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:31,745
Do I want to know how?

979
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,729
A lot of files. Looks like
they were burning records.

980
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:38,395
It's a bunch of junk. An old pot.

981
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:40,485
- Hey, Stokes?
- Yeah?

982
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,571
- Can you come in here for a minute?
- Yeah.

983
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:53,452
- What have you got?
- Stop, stop.

984
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:58,040
Stop. I seem to have
stepped on a land mine

985
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,584
of some sort.

986
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:04,842
- Why'd you do something like that?
- It was a slow day.

987
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:09,601
- I wouldn't move.
- I'd like to at some point.

988
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:12,433
- Campbell, Garfield, get in here!
- What'll they do?

989
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,974
- They're architects.
- So they know explosives?

990
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,813
- It's that or Savitz.
- What?

991
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,818
Boy, it is burned to heck in here.

992
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:20,945
Everybody just stay where they are.

993
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:24,825
Looks like the lieutenant here is
standing on an unexploded mine.

994
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,322
Why would you do that?

995
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,612
- I asked him the same thing.
- He did.

996
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:34,326
Well, you're going to have to...

997
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,964
- step off of it eventually.
- Well, eventually, yes.

998
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:44,800
And either the mine is so damaged
from the fire that it's a dud...

999
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:46,133
How likely is that?

1000
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:48,966
Most likely.

1001
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:53,721
But if it's not, there
will probably be

1002
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,018
a sizable explosion.

1003
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:13,282
- How much do you weigh?
- Uh, one-seventy-five.

1004
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:20,963
Grad school, I was 175.

1005
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,101
Now what?

1006
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:38,857
Well, if we did this right,
you just step off.

1007
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:49,868
Okay, well, what say, uh, you
fellas head to the exit?

1008
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,579
I think we'll just hang
around and keep you company.

1009
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,411
That's not necessary, Frank.

1010
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:58,501
I think it is. Fellas?

1011
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,412
I'm not going anywhere.

1012
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:02,421
I'll be fine right here.

1013
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,634
Yeah, what the hell.

1014
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,638
Okay, James, that's
how it's gonna be.

1015
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:14,301
Well...

1016
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:19,648
on the off-chance that this
thing blows us sky high...

1017
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,476
been an honor serving with you all.

1018
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:25,611
- Same here.
- Agreed.

1019
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:31,659
Okay, so I'll just count
to three and step off.

1020
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,071
- Good.
- Take your time.

1021
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:48,756
One...

1022
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,674
- Goddamn it.
- Shit.

1023
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:59,555
- What happened to two and three?
- I panicked.

1024
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,189
Told you it was a dud.

1025
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:54,238
<i>Picasso.</i>

1026
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,374
Is that gold?

1027
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,476
It's from teeth.

1028
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:01,156
That's a Rodin.

1029
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,706
Altaussee!

1030
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:36,213
The <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i> is
in the mine at Altaussee.

1031
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:37,419
What?

1032
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,505
- It's right here.
- What did you find?

1033
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,761
- Sam, give us a hand!
- What is it?

1034
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,176
It was stored there a year ago.

1035
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,929
- How do you know?
- It says nothing after that.

1036
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,522
It's still there.

1037
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,526
Want to go get it?

1038
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:01,857
You give that Claire a big kiss.

1039
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,487
She'd like that.

1040
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:24,296
Hey, sarge, we're trying
to get to Altaussee.

1041
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:26,089
Keep going that way.

1042
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:28,053
- Where you fellas headed?
- Home.

1043
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:29,889
Germany surrendered. War's over.

1044
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:31,598
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

1045
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:34,310
Ain't there supposed to
be a parade or something?

1046
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:36,315
Probably not in Germany.

1047
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,067
Yeah, right.

1048
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:52,203
Jesus Christ, they blew the mine.

1049
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:55,160
- Any other openings?
- Two others, blown to shit.

1050
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:58,045
They stored armaments here,
then blew everything up.

1051
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:00,377
- Who gave the order? War's over.
- Ask him.

1052
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,542
Caught a Kraut, Wegner,
hiding in town.

1053
01:37:02,608 --> 01:37:05,712
Sam, Savitz, find some locals,
get a diagram of the mine.

1054
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:08,347
- Walter and I can look at the entrances.
- Okay.

1055
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:09,614
- Come on.
- Captain,

1056
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:11,968
- can I talk to that Kraut?
- Sure can.

1057
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:21,903
- Burn your smokes?
- Yeah.

1058
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,897
Thanks.

1059
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:36,246
- I'm told you speak English.
- I do.

1060
01:37:36,642 --> 01:37:39,245
- Would you like a cigarette?
- Don't smoke.

1061
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:42,961
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

1062
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:45,047
So I assumed.

1063
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:47,799
Why'd you blow the mine?

1064
01:37:49,655 --> 01:37:51,428
What was in the mine?

1065
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:54,936
Salt, I think.

1066
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,891
- You know the war is over.
- Congratulations.

1067
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:04,108
We believe there are
pieces of art in that mine

1068
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:06,693
that we've been tasked to find.

1069
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:08,695
Did you take them out?

1070
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:11,903
What will you offer
me for my answer?

1071
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,406
As you say, the war is over.

1072
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,621
I followed orders.
I committed no crime.

1073
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:22,914
According to the Geneva Conventions,
I will be released and sent home.

1074
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:30,465
I was told that before you were sent
here, you ran one of those camps.

1075
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:34,676
- Who told you that?
- A little bird.

1076
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:39,852
- You're not Jewish, lieutenant?
- No.

1077
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:42,521
Then you should thank me.

1078
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:53,069
You know, I don't smoke either.

1079
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:56,827
My first cigarette.

1080
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:00,748
But, mm...

1081
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:04,247
I want to remember this moment.

1082
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:09,631
I'm gonna go home soon.

1083
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:13,514
Got a nice apartment in New
York on the Upper West Side.

1084
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:16,597
There's a deli down the
street called Sid's.

1085
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:19,350
Every morning,

1086
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:24,142
I walk there and I get a
cup of coffee and a bagel,

1087
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:26,276
and I read the newspaper.

1088
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:31,776
I think about it every day here. It'll be
the first place I go when I get stateside.

1089
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:36,868
I'm gonna be sitting there, eating one
of Sid Meldman's toasted onion bagels

1090
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:41,535
and reading a tiny article in
<i>The New York Times</i>, page...

1091
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:44,295
18...

1092
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:47,791
that says you, Colonel
Wegner, were hanged

1093
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:50,551
for your crimes you
committed during the war

1094
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:53,463
and you were buried
in an unmarked grave.

1095
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:58,013
And then I'll think
about my cigarette...

1096
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:04,356
and I'll think about you sitting there
with that stupid look on your face.

1097
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:12,319
Then I'll finish my coffee,

1098
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:15,485
leave the paper for
Sid to wrap fish in.

1099
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:18,784
I'll never think of you again.

1100
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:28,164
Sure you don't want that cigarette?

1101
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:45,894
The Germans didn't blow it!
The local miners did!

1102
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:49,778
They found out the Nazis' plan, sealed
the mine entrances to stop them.

1103
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,983
- We'll dig in.
- How long will that take?

1104
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:54,649
A day or two if these
miners help us.

1105
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:57,568
Might wanna move quicker. We got
orders to pull out tonight.

1106
01:40:57,635 --> 01:41:00,579
- What orders?
- Top brass.

1107
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:03,992
This territory goes to the Russians.
They're moving south now.

1108
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:06,581
- Should be here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1109
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:08,417
Maybe sooner.

1110
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:12,083
Do you have any explosives?

1111
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:21,926
Here we go! Everybody down!

1112
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:29,771
Maybe I should do this.

1113
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:31,902
What do you know about explosives?

1114
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:33,438
Nothing.

1115
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:35,239
Okay.

1116
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:47,512
We're short one. We're missing one.

1117
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:51,603
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- We're missing a goddamn panel.

1118
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:10,327
We have to go, fellas,
unless you speak Russian!

1119
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:12,723
We've covered all this area.

1120
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:13,991
We didn't look here.

1121
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:15,714
- We did.
- We didn't look here.

1122
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:18,126
This is us right now. This
is where we have to go.

1123
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:19,669
This is this.

1124
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:23,180
No, this is where we are now.
And this is where we didn't look.

1125
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:26,183
We were here, we went over here.
Where didn't we go?

1126
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:29,016
We didn't go here and
we didn't go there.

1127
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:31,272
Yeah, we gotta... This, this.

1128
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:33,273
- Give me a hand, will you?
- What?

1129
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:40,490
You are going to miss me
so much when this is over.

1130
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:41,945
I doubt it.

1131
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:50,579
Okay.

1132
01:43:57,648 --> 01:44:00,171
Right now you wish that
German had shot you.

1133
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:03,137
I do.

1134
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:15,396
- Get out of here now, I'm not kidding.
- I'm going after Stokes.

1135
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:17,481
Be right behind you, captain!

1136
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:23,699
Stokes!

1137
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,788
Frank, we gotta go!

1138
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:46,680
Stokes!

1139
01:44:49,575 --> 01:44:51,018
Stokes!

1140
01:45:44,129 --> 01:45:45,981
Let's get out of here.

1141
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:52,533
Hey.

1142
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:57,080
- Hey, hey, we gotta go.
- Give me a hand.

1143
01:45:57,142 --> 01:46:00,246
- No, no, Frank, we gotta go.
- Give me a hand.

1144
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:05,001
- Holy shit.
- Come on, give me a hand.

1145
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,298
- Holy shit.
- Stokes!

1146
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,054
Granger!

1147
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,011
Jesus.

1148
01:46:11,073 --> 01:46:13,693
- We gotta get out of here.
- Give us a hand.

1149
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:17,183
- Holy shit!
- He just said that.

1150
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:18,931
I did.

1151
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:30,617
<i>You can add this to the long
list of Hitler's failures.</i>

1152
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:33,825
<i>He tried to take something
that could never be his.</i>

1153
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:38,915
<i>The story of our lives painted
on canvas or etched in stone.</i>

1154
01:46:39,518 --> 01:46:41,712
<i>With the Russians
bearing down on us,</i>

1155
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:44,248
<i>we left Altaussee with
some 3000 pieces,</i>

1156
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:50,218
<i>including the Ghent Altarpiece and
the Bruges Madonna and Child.</i>

1157
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:53,512
<i>We did leave something
for our Russian friends</i>

1158
01:46:53,574 --> 01:46:55,426
<i>to take back to Leningrad.</i>

1159
01:47:07,379 --> 01:47:11,734
We headed northwest. Savitz and Campbell
flew the Altarpiece to Belgium.

1160
01:47:11,967 --> 01:47:18,200
<i>It was displayed in Brussels and then
returned to the chapel in St. Bavo.</i>

1161
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:30,170
With Second Lieutenant
James Granger,

1162
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:33,555
several trainloads of French
art found in a castle

1163
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:36,263
<i>in Bavaria were returned to Paris.</i>

1164
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:47,068
Thank you, James.

1165
01:47:55,052 --> 01:47:57,405
<i>Everything from paintings
to sculptures,</i>

1166
01:47:58,097 --> 01:48:00,950
tapestries, even jewelry,
is being returned.

1167
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:06,794
It is the greatest collection of private
art in the history of the world.

1168
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:10,005
We also found 5000 church bells,

1169
01:48:10,067 --> 01:48:13,421
300 trolley cars, 3 million books,

1170
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,715
<i>and thousands of Torahs.</i>

1171
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:20,018
In all, the numbers are staggering.

1172
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:23,477
There were over 5 million
pieces recovered.

1173
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:40,369
There are still, of course, many
great works that have gone missing.

1174
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:43,034
Raphael's <i>Portrait of a
Young Man,</i> for instance.

1175
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:46,329
And with your permission,
I'd like to keep looking for him.

1176
01:48:47,312 --> 01:48:50,916
Well, lieutenant, let me have a
talk with Secretary Stimson here

1177
01:48:50,983 --> 01:48:53,927
- and I'll give you an answer.
- Thank you, sir.

1178
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:57,047
And you lost men on this
mission, lieutenant?

1179
01:48:57,114 --> 01:49:01,094
Yes, sir, two men. A Frenchman
named Jean-Claude Clermont

1180
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:13,105
<i>And a Brit named Donald Jeffries,</i>

1181
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:16,367
who lost his life saving the
Bruges Madonna and Child.

1182
01:49:16,425 --> 01:49:19,324
Lieutenant Stokes,
I have one question.

1183
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:22,239
- You said the <i>Madonna.</i>
- Yes, sir, the Bruges Madonna.

1184
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:25,285
- Michelangelo made it, right?
- Yes, sir.

1185
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:29,045
- And you lost a man trying to save it.
- Donald Jeffries.

1186
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:32,299
You think it was worth
it, for a piece of art?

1187
01:49:33,275 --> 01:49:37,346
Do you think Jeffries would say it
was worth it, if he could speak?

1188
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:40,261
If he could speak...

1189
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:45,513
I think he would.

1190
01:49:46,538 --> 01:49:49,016
All right then, how
about you, lieutenant?

1191
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:52,562
<i>You were in charge, and this
gets to the heart of the matter.</i>

1192
01:49:52,628 --> 01:49:55,072
<i>Do you think 30 years from now,</i>

1193
01:49:55,130 --> 01:50:00,828
<i>anyone's going to remember that
these men died for a piece of art?</i>

1194
01:50:13,398 --> 01:50:14,920
Yeah.

1195
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,933
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1196
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:31,104
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
