1
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,519
The Governor wants these
trade routes re-opened.

2
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,522
These rebel Celts need to be
dealt with once and for all.

3
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,776
This entire territory
requires a clear

4
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,402
and well-defined message.

5
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,025
Yes, Tribune Corvus.

6
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,956
No!

7
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,793
Kill them.

8
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,496
Kill them all.

9
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,657
Ah!

10
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,266
Useless!

11
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,398
You've dragged me from a perfectly
adequate brothel for this?

12
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,743
What Caesar saw in this
hell hole, I'll never know.

13
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,907
These Thracians are far
too costly to feed.

14
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,249
They're always maiming the guards.

15
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,921
I'm looking for something new,
Bellator, something fresh.

16
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,392
They call him The Celt.

17
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,568
They say his people were horsemen

18
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,567
and that he is the last of them.

19
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,986
Celt! Celt! Celt!

20
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,263
Wasted out here in the provinces,
wouldn't you say, Master?

21
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,529
Make way! Make way!

22
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,741
Off! Off the road! Off!

23
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,865
Off the road!

24
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,204
Make way for your betters!

25
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,459
Move it, scum!

26
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,877
Clear the way there!

27
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,500
Move!

28
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,313
The horse.

29
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,149
Back in line, slave!

30
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,109
The horse is in pain,
you ignorant pig!

31
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,108
Stop!

32
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,782
Let him help the horse.

33
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,943
Yes, My Lady.

34
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,127
Easy. Easy, boy.

35
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,107
Put pressure on the
top of the leg here,

36
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,357
so he doesn't feel the
pain when I move him.

37
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,003
I'm sorry, My Lady. He's a savage.

38
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,418
Get up!

39
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,348
Harness another horse.

40
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,691
Why would the brute do that?

41
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,032
Because it was the
kindest thing to do.

42
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,119
Come.

43
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,829
Thank you.

44
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,719
Go on!

45
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,648
A whole year in Rome and I
never saw you look at any man

46
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,772
the way you looked at that slave.

47
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,195
I can't believe he had
the strength to do that.

48
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,898
Didn't you see his muscles?

49
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,865
That's not what I meant.

50
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,075
Really?

51
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,778
Oh, please...

52
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,080
Look. There it is.

53
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,213
We're home.

54
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,574
Driver, what is it?

55
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,955
The Vinalia, My Lady.

56
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,247
The streets are blocked.
Drunkards everywhere.

57
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,957
- What?
- Come on.

58
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,884
My Lady?

59
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,010
My Lady!

60
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,303
We'll meet you back at the villa.

61
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,676
My Lady!

62
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,742
I remember every statue,
every street corner.

63
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,952
Does it make you miss Rome?

64
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,076
It makes me forget it.

65
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,656
Cassia, oh, it's so
good to see you.

66
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,617
But how are you here? We weren't
expecting you until after Vinalia.

67
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,786
I couldn't bear to spend
another day in Rome.

68
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,453
Too many arrogant men who
flatter you with their presence.

69
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,583
It sounds like my baby
is no longer a child.

70
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,548
- Father, are you crying?
- Shh.

71
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,636
Tell no one.

72
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,847
Or I'll never haggle a
decent price again.

73
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,343
We missed you.

74
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,312
Juno's tit! Is this
all your luggage?

75
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,232
What have you done, purchase
the entire city of Rome?

76
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,484
Did you meet anyone there?

77
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,194
Nobody worth talking
about in Pompeii.

78
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,279
Well, not to worry.

79
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,822
I think your father has informed

80
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,491
every unmarried man in
the city of your return.

81
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,326
Oh, no. Really?

82
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,663
Now, come on. I want to
hear everything about Rome.

83
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,491
I've missed you.

84
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,923
Welcome to your new home, savages.

85
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,388
Keep walking!

86
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,766
Stop!

87
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,268
Unlock them.

88
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,446
Feed these animals.

89
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,324
Vires!

90
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,292
Oh, I missed you.

91
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,045
I missed you. Hello.

92
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,750
He's pleased to see you, My Lady.

93
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,592
And I can see he's
been in good hands.

94
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,760
Thank you, Felix.

95
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,054
And I'll have Vires ready for
you first thing tomorrow.

96
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,597
I'll exercise him myself tonight.

97
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,057
Thank you.

98
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,183
I'll see you tomorrow.

99
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,190
Atticus...

100
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,535
I think that's The Celt.

101
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,786
Which Celt?

102
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,489
The Celt.

103
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,750
They say that Celt is
faster even than you.

104
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,049
They always say that.

105
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,358
He wants to know your name, Celt.

106
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,023
He wants the name of the
man who killed his brother.

107
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,027
He wants to know my name?

108
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,092
Two wine rations on
the big Thracian.

109
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,478
Two wine rations. Done.

110
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,079
Explain.

111
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,914
He did not start it.
He was trying to eat.

112
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,160
Bellator!

113
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,377
Your purpose is to care
for these men, is it not?

114
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,009
Having them bite pieces
from one another

115
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,056
is of no value if no one
is paying to see it.

116
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,762
I'm sorry, Master Graecus.

117
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,599
That one is done.

118
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,438
This one...

119
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,692
Can be repaired.

120
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,196
And the next time, Bellator,
it will be at your cost.

121
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,161
I'll remember you, Celt.

122
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,415
Open the gate!

123
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,631
Close it!

124
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,309
You owe me two wine rations, Celt.

125
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,850
Thirsty? Okay.

126
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,600
What's wrong?

127
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,874
Vires!

128
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,710
Vires!

129
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,540
Wake up, scum.

130
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,704
On your feet.

131
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,472
Relax.

132
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,972
If I was going to kill you, Celt...

133
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,933
I would have done it already.

134
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,153
What is your name?

135
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,030
We will have to speak
at some point.

136
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,375
No, we don't.

137
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,712
What we have to do is kill
each other at some point.

138
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,213
So my name's my own, I have
no interest in learning yours.

139
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,813
Everyone out!

140
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:37,897
Move!

141
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,544
You're getting old, Atticus.

142
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,170
Plenty of young flesh out here just
aching to take apart a champion.

143
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:09,092
When I win in the arena
tomorrow, I'm a free man.

144
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,090
It's Roman law.

145
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,053
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

146
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,230
Atticus, my champion,

147
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,651
tomorrow you have the honor
of closing the games.

148
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,486
First,

149
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,110
let us see if I have
found an opponent

150
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,111
worthy of you.

151
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,366
Now...

152
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:39,168
Who's the poor bastard who
has to die for my freedom?

153
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,130
Unlucky, Celt.

154
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,063
Very unlucky.

155
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,478
But I'm going to
take it easy on you.

156
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,031
Give you a fighting
chance for tomorrow.

157
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,261
You may have earned
your reputation,

158
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:36,140
but not fighting against
a gladiator like me.

159
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,855
You made that a little too obvious.

160
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,752
Did I make that too obvious?

161
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,292
Bellator!

162
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,334
Get away!

163
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,795
Get out of the way! Get up, scum!

164
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,464
Back to work!

165
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,886
Why did you save my life?

166
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:15,195
No gladiator should die
from a blade to the back.

167
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:20,203
When you die, the blow
will come from the front.

168
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,657
I promise it will be tomorrow.

169
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,037
And it will come from my hand.

170
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,251
Well, I can make you
a better promise.

171
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,384
When the time comes,

172
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,928
your death will be quick.

173
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,549
And it will come from my hand.

174
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,452
Don't worry. Your plan is
nothing short of brilliance.

175
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,658
Only a mad man would advise the
Emperor against investing.

176
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,376
Well, let us hope that the
Emperor has not sent us one.

177
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,954
Keep up in time.

178
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,089
Senator,

179
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,885
do forgive us for not being able
to receive you at the harbor.

180
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:04,098
Severus, you're a busy man.
I understand entirely.

181
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,101
Besides, if I had a wife
as beautiful as yours,

182
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,851
I'd be in no hurry to
forsake her company.

183
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,190
I am Senator Quintas Attius Corvus.

184
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,775
May the gods grace me to
bless your kind hospitality.

185
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,194
You're most welcome, Senator.

186
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,571
So, Senator, tell us
the news from Rome.

187
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,025
How does the new
emperor, Titus, fare?

188
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,906
The "new" emperor?

189
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,249
The new emperor, Titus, fares well.

190
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,828
His father, Vespasian,
was loved by his people,

191
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,543
and they continue that
love for his son.

192
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,624
- As the gods demand?
- Indeed.

193
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,009
Severus, I have a question for you.

194
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,302
On my journey from the harbor,

195
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,637
I noticed some of your townsfolk

196
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,597
turned their backs towards me.

197
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,307
There wouldn't be some kind
of problem, would there?

198
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,852
Some local resentment against Rome?

199
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,272
No. Nothing of the sort.

200
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,982
A tiny...

201
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,904
A miniscule minority of
opposition to our plans.

202
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,614
But our new construction

203
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,408
will provide the people
with a new aqueduct,

204
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,955
better sanitation, bigger
bath houses, a new arena.

205
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,204
A whole new Pompeii.

206
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,421
What was all that about
the new emperor?

207
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,756
He's a politician.

208
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,300
Be careful what you say to him.

209
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,511
Do you think we can
do business with him?

210
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,886
He wouldn't be here if the
Emperor wasn't interested.

211
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,481
Why would father invite a
Roman senator into our home?

212
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,149
How could you allow such a thing?

213
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,901
If we want Rome's rich to
spend their money here,

214
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,903
we must keep up with
what they demand.

215
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,196
What they demand?

216
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,032
Does father have any idea what's
going on in Rome right now?

217
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,576
Since Titus took power,
everything has changed.

218
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,788
Every crooked man now has
the ear of the Emperor.

219
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,833
And they assume that they can
take whatever they want.

220
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,044
Cassia, why did you
come home early?

221
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,588
What happened in Rome?

222
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,754
I'd simply had my fill of it.

223
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,603
Mother, is that Vires?

224
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,905
Whoa. Whoa. Easy! Easy!

225
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,111
Vires, what are you doing out here?

226
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,821
Where's Felix?

227
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,725
I heard tomorrow
is your last fight.

228
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,268
That's right.

229
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:59,145
After I kill you, they
will give me my freedom.

230
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,602
They won't do it.

231
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,820
Not while your arm's still strong.

232
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,614
Freedom is Rome's promise.

233
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,068
You trust them to
keep that promise?

234
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,991
I trust their law.

235
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,085
There's only one freedom
for a gladiator.

236
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,832
When you die in that arena,
you die unconquered.

237
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,502
And you spit in the eye of Rome.

238
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,639
Then this is your future.

239
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,342
And you die a slave.

240
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,773
But not me.

241
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:44,695
Tomorrow, Rome will make
good on its promise.

242
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:50,734
You, unfortunately, will not be
alive to see that I am right.

243
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,120
So sure?

244
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,870
Today you showed me
your weaknesses.

245
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,286
Your left arm is weaker
than your right.

246
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,172
So you protect your ribs at
the expense of your neck.

247
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,590
And you should learn how to thrust

248
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,213
when you're shifting your weight

249
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,053
and stop favoring a high guard.

250
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,474
It would make you less predictable.

251
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,809
This one.

252
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,026
That one.

253
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,479
Mmm...

254
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,984
These two.

255
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,362
On your feet, slaves.

256
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,917
All right.

257
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,927
You, here.

258
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,301
You, barbarian, here!

259
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,108
Both excellent fighters.

260
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,485
One, a champion,

261
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:54,157
and the other, tried and
proven in the provinces.

262
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,325
I want to see him from behind.

263
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,660
Why so serious?

264
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,914
Not so bad for a night's work.

265
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,163
Firm.

266
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,797
But what of his weaponry?

267
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:13,002
That is an inspection
you'll have to pay for.

268
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,017
And this will be the new arena,

269
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,812
specifically designed
for chariot races.

270
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,852
Yes.

271
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,694
Very detailed, Severus.

272
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,654
But I don't believe
that this project

273
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,156
is really suitable for
an Imperial investment.

274
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,866
These dalliances in the countryside

275
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,161
hold very little interest
for the Emperor.

276
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,704
I was led to understand...

277
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,747
No. No. Unfortunately,
the Emperor's vision

278
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,667
for the future is
firmly fixed on Rome.

279
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,793
I, however, am
interested in investing.

280
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,517
Good.

281
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,777
Have the pledges drawn up.

282
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,323
You'll have my mark on them
tomorrow. After your games.

283
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,243
I do believe a drink is in order.

284
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,536
Of course. Shall we
join our guests?

285
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,330
Perhaps your daughter can bring it.

286
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,749
My daughter?

287
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,082
Look over there.

288
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,928
The slave who can talk to horses.

289
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,222
He is a fine specimen.

290
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,847
Well, you can't deny it.

291
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,855
Turn around.

292
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,239
Ah, Cassia.

293
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,248
May I impose upon you for a moment?

294
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,376
Your presence has been requested.

295
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,252
Yes, of course, Father.

296
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,457
You will need this.
It is not for you.

297
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,349
Cassia, may I introduce...

298
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,143
Senator Corvus.

299
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,513
Lady Cassia.

300
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,434
My, how I have missed you.

301
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,524
You are exquisite.

302
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,148
Senator Corvus,
I don't know what to say.

303
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,817
For me? How kind.

304
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,784
You two have met?

305
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,370
Severus, you're still here.

306
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,575
I did not know you
knew my daughter.

307
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,545
Then you should hear
the whole story.

308
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,798
Tomorrow in the arena
when I sign your pledges.

309
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,672
Thank you.

310
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,853
Marcus?

311
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,648
The Senator and Cassia
have already met, in Rome.

312
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,567
Then she requires a chaperone.

313
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,156
She survived a year
in Rome without us.

314
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,786
I'm sure she can survive
10 minutes on our balcony.

315
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,955
In Rome, I thought we
had an understanding.

316
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,499
No. You had an understanding.

317
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,376
One for which I gave you no cause.

318
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,296
Your mere presence gives
me cause, My Lady.

319
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,881
A beauty such as yours has no place

320
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,210
in a holiday resort like this.

321
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,218
Surely, a creature such as you

322
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,842
can have no home but
in the Eternal City.

323
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,517
Senator, I have no intention
of returning to Rome.

324
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,687
And if you were to
return as my wife?

325
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,730
Your wife?

326
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,315
You may consider it a compliment.

327
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,358
Senator Corvus, I believe
you have mistaken me

328
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,362
for the kind of woman who drapes
herself across your lap in Rome.

329
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,031
I have no wish to become your wife.

330
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,158
A spirited refusal.

331
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,032
I would have expected nothing less.

332
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,117
Enjoy the remains of the
Vinalia, Senator. Good night.

333
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,822
Is this normal?

334
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,283
It is the mountain. It
grumbles from time to time.

335
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,425
Bring this man. I need him.

336
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,010
- My Lady
- Now!

337
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,645
My Lady, it's Vires!

338
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,146
Please, before he injures himself.

339
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,943
I have to go in alone.

340
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,817
No.

341
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,572
Let him.

342
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,823
My Lady, he's a savage.

343
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,742
Let him.

344
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,435
Easy!

345
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,898
My Lady, he's not safe.

346
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,601
Move.

347
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,152
Wait outside.

348
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,413
How did you do that?

349
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,923
I asked him.

350
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,797
You could ride before
you were a gladiator?

351
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,972
I could ride before I could walk.

352
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,429
My people were horsemen.

353
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,769
"Were" horsemen?

354
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,151
My family were butchered
by the Romans.

355
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,526
- I'm so sorry.
- "Sorry"?

356
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,907
What would a Roman
know of such things?

357
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,201
I am not a Roman.
I'm a citizen of Pompeii.

358
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,453
Then why do I see Rome's
eagle everywhere I turn?

359
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,281
I'm no part of that.

360
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,338
After a year in Rome, I hoped
never to see that eagle again.

361
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,546
And yet, here it is, thrust
into the soil outside my home.

362
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,969
My father believes that he can
bargain with those animals.

363
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,763
My father...

364
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,847
He would have killed
every last one of them.

365
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,971
My Lady?

366
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,112
If they catch you up there
they'll punish you.

367
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,740
My Lady?

368
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,299
My Lady, is everything all right?

369
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,786
Wait! Come back!

370
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,284
Come back!

371
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,277
What's wrong?

372
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,539
If they catch you
up here with me...

373
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,118
I'll tell them it was my choice.

374
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,751
There they are!

375
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,760
I have to take you back.

376
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,105
No. You go and leave me here.

377
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,565
If you ride you have a chance.

378
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,110
- A chance at what?
- At freedom.

379
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,272
But at what cost to you?

380
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,659
Tell the guards I brought
you here by force.

381
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,952
The blame is mine.

382
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,284
Get him off that horse!

383
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,956
It wasn't his fault. The horse
bolted. It was out of control.

384
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,016
Senator, please. This
slave saved my life.

385
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,639
He does not deserve this.

386
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,770
Lady Cassia, you were unharmed?

387
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,223
I'm perfectly all right.

388
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,649
If I were to spare the
life of this slave,

389
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,978
what would it be worth to you?

390
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:58,778
Senator?

391
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,528
I believe you understand
the question, my dear.

392
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,156
I would be grateful for your mercy.

393
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,409
Well...

394
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,960
This is your lucky day, slave.

395
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,463
The Lady Cassia has
saved your life.

396
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,382
Who owns this slave?

397
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,131
I do, Senator.

398
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,506
Then I suggest you punish
it and then remove it.

399
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,220
Fifteen lashes should suffice.

400
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,011
After all, mercy is a virtue.

401
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,025
Father, you have to stop this.

402
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,700
There's nothing I can do about it.

403
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,083
You saved his life.

404
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,043
Content yourself with that.

405
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,514
Senator Corvus requires
a service of you.

406
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,092
Of me?

407
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,227
This gladiator.

408
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,285
What do you have planned
for him tomorrow?

409
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,690
He fights last.

410
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,733
Single combat against my champion.

411
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,859
No.

412
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,482
He fights first.

413
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,485
And he dies first.

414
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,083
Fifteen lashes and he
didn't make a sound.

415
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,205
I could have prevented this.

416
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,916
I don't know what I was thinking.

417
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,011
That he made you feel alive?

418
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,506
He made me feel safe.

419
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,853
A man like that does not
deserve to die in the arena.

420
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,391
This is not your fault, Cassia.

421
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,061
He has caught the Senator's wrath.

422
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,362
I thought that,

423
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,614
in leaving Rome, that man
would forget about me

424
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,944
and turn his attentions toward
some other poor victim.

425
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,335
I saw a look in that man's
eye tonight, Ariadne.

426
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,291
The same look I saw in Rome.

427
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,206
But the Senator never
laid a hand on you.

428
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,251
Only because I left
Rome before he could.

429
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:31,431
Now Rome has followed
us back to Pompeii

430
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,930
to turn the world inside out.

431
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,890
You certainly know how
to prepare for a battle.

432
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,229
I hope she was worth it.

433
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,528
A terrible waste of good wine.

434
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,039
Can you feel that?

435
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,143
It is the gods.

436
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,732
They have a plan for us all.

437
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,059
Perhaps.

438
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,857
What do you mean?

439
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,829
Tonight I saw the man who
killed my whole family.

440
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,325
Perhaps the gods spared
me for a reason.

441
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:50,344
The Romans took my family
from me 20 years ago.

442
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,887
At night I try and remember
their faces, but I cannot.

443
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:04,775
But I know one day, the gods
will bring me to them again.

444
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,908
My name is Milo.

445
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,873
Atticus.

446
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,766
You, that tunnel.

447
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,647
Send The Celt into that tunnel.

448
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,073
I thought he was to fight Atticus.

449
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,367
You're being given
new instructions.

450
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,694
Yes, Master.

451
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,705
And Atticus?

452
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,665
He'll fight single
combat as billed.

453
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,584
Put him with the big Spartan.

454
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,836
He'll give the
audience a good show.

455
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,797
And Atticus will beat him
and win his freedom.

456
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,925
Is that really what the
audience will want to see?

457
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,343
What are you saying?

458
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,053
Don't you think they'd rather see

459
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,632
a gladiator meeting
death rather than life?

460
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,551
Especially a death
as glorious as his?

461
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,895
Stop.

462
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,820
You.

463
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,027
That way.

464
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,159
You too, barbarian.

465
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,138
Senator Corvus.

466
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,015
Lady Cassia.

467
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,184
Come sit beside me.

468
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,528
Give me the benefit of your wisdom.

469
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,072
Do you enjoy the sports?

470
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,656
Men killing each other for our
amusement is not a sport.

471
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,873
Everywhere. All new.

472
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,666
I don't have time for this, Graecus.
What are you suggesting?

473
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,922
That we cancel the games?

474
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,924
Of course not.
Merely postpone them.

475
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,136
This amphitheater has stood
for a hundred years.

476
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,721
It withstood the great earthquake.

477
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,391
It may not be safe. Use your eyes.

478
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,393
I'm just saying I cannot
be held responsible

479
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,020
for what may happen.

480
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,563
Then don't be.

481
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,607
I take full responsibility.

482
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,820
How can we expect Rome to trust
us to rebuild an entire city

483
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,945
if we can't stage a
simple bloody spectacle?

484
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,672
Fetch my litter.

485
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,217
I'm leaving town for a few days.

486
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,516
Move.

487
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,028
Stop. Shackle them!

488
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,996
What is this?

489
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,127
This is your greatest
moment, Atticus.

490
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,088
Your final day in the arena.

491
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,967
I'm supposed to fight
single combat.

492
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,136
Bring them their weapons!

493
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,394
Good fortune, Atticus.

494
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:26,070
To those about to
die, we salute you!

495
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:31,332
By the patronage of
Marcus Cassius Severus

496
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,286
and for the glory of Emperor Titus,

497
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,839
remember, all here,
the mighty victory

498
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,338
of Senator Quintas Attius Corvus

499
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:44,637
and his annihilation of
the Celtic Rebellion.

500
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,305
The Celtic Rebellion?

501
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,726
Your great and noble victory
for the Empire, Senator,

502
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,270
re-opening the
northern trade routes.

503
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,020
The history books record
it as your finest hour.

504
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,649
I thought perhaps you
might like the honor

505
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,943
of opening these games
in a similar manner.

506
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,693
Severus, you flatter me.

507
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,862
We'll make a Roman out of you yet.

508
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,661
People of Pompeii!

509
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:13,082
May Jupiter and Venus bless the
Vinalia and honor these games!

510
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,424
Let the games begin!

511
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,222
- This isn't a battle.
- What?

512
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,682
This is a massacre.

513
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,100
How do you know?

514
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,728
Because I was there.

515
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,817
The rebel Celts are in retreat,

516
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,862
leaving rape and
slaughter in their wake,

517
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,698
returning to their
unholy lair to feast

518
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,244
on the flesh of their
innocent victims.

519
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,504
This is what you've
trained for, scum.

520
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,423
Now get out there.

521
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:06,091
Quintas Attius Corvus gave them
every chance to surrender.

522
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:13,807
But mercy was an alien
concept to these savages,

523
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:19,440
and with heavy heart,
Quintas Attius Corvus

524
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:25,571
ordered his mighty legions, in the
name of the Emperor, to attack.

525
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,280
Shields up!

526
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,875
Push!

527
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,143
Is this what you call sport?

528
00:55:56,144 --> 00:56:00,144
No, Lady Cassia, this is
not sport. This is politics.

529
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,413
We can't hold them!

530
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,574
Back!

531
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,215
Severus, this is not
exactly how I remember it.

532
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,038
What exactly is that slave to you?

533
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,079
Everything that you
are not, Senator.

534
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,834
Then you should be pleased to learn

535
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,420
your father has granted
me your hand in marriage.

536
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,422
- What?
- I made no such arrangement.

537
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,216
Because he knows
that if he does not,

538
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,052
I will inform Titus that your
father has called into question

539
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:56,055
our "new" emperor's
ability to rule.

540
00:57:56,056 --> 00:58:00,261
Titus will have your entire
family hung from the city walls.

541
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,522
Milo!

542
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,862
If I were to marry you...

543
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:37,656
- Cassia...
- If I marry you,

544
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,484
is my family spared?

545
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,908
Your family will become my family,

546
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,497
under the protection
of the Emperor.

547
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,045
With all of the benefits
that that implies.

548
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,380
Pompeii! Pompeii! Pompeii!

549
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,881
Senator!

550
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,843
I do not yield to
the power of Rome!

551
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,170
I spit on it!

552
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,221
He would not dare.

553
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,942
Pompeii! Pompeii! Pompeii!

554
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,900
Get a detachment in the arena now.

555
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,102
Now!

556
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,447
You were right, brother.

557
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:11,080
Everything they promised,
nothing but lies.

558
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:21,420
Live! Live! Live!

559
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,560
What do you think you're doing?

560
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,277
Madame, take your seat!

561
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,856
If you want to live
you will sit down!

562
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,612
Now!

563
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,578
If you kill him now, on the
tip of 100 Roman arrows,

564
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:48,787
you make him a martyr to the mob.

565
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,456
Is that what you want?

566
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,541
To take home to your
Emperor a revolution?

567
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,293
And if you reverse this decision,

568
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,003
how will it be spoken of in Rome?

569
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,546
They will whisper it
behind your back,

570
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,381
that you have a wife who
does not obey your will.

571
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,967
Can your reputation
bear such a weakness?

572
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,428
I might become your wife,
but you will never break me.

573
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,804
But I will break you,

574
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:09,683
and you will stay broken to
stand, sit or crawl as I decree.

575
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,886
Do you understand me?

576
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,984
Proculus, have your guard
take her back to the villa.

577
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,687
Keep her there.

578
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,828
I think the wedding
shall be in Rome.

579
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,510
People of Pompeii!

580
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,759
People of Pompeii!

581
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,349
Vulcan speaks!

582
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,816
Vulcan decrees that man to
be the champion of Pompeii!

583
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,526
Decrees that he is worthy to stand

584
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:03,529
face-to-face against
the might of Rome!

585
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,993
Great Vulcan, we hear you
speak and will obey!

586
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,417
Proculus...

587
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,336
Show these cowards
what really happens

588
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,006
when you dare to challenge
the might of Rome.

589
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,709
With pleasure.

590
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,176
Come on! Come on!

591
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,762
Faster! Move it!

592
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,984
What's going on? My Lady?

593
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,187
Don't touch her! Let her go!

594
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,447
Cassia!

595
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:11,305
By the patronage of Senator
Quintas Attius Corvus,

596
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,557
the champion of Rome,

597
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:17,936
Marcus Proculus, hero of
the Celtic Rebellion,

598
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:22,187
will now face the new champion
of Pompeii, The Celt,

599
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,770
in single combat!

600
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,581
All hail to Emperor Titus!

601
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,299
I know you.

602
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,843
Really?

603
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,055
Well, whatever revenge you
think you're going to have,

604
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,008
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

605
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,637
Bring this slave a better sword.

606
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:52,823
This blade's dull.

607
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,241
Is it?

608
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,745
Let's give them a good show, huh?

609
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,407
Kill him!

610
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,121
Kill him now!

611
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,137
No!

612
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,347
You're brave. I'll give you that.

613
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:25,552
But no savage could ever
be the match for a Roman.

614
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,097
How about 20 of us?

615
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,529
No!

616
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,580
Wait! Wait!

617
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,665
No!

618
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,000
Mercy!

619
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,703
No!

620
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:00,799
Good to see you, brother.

621
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:02,971
And you.

622
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,319
Aurelia.

623
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,743
Kill him.

624
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,415
Kill him.

625
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,411
On further consideration,

626
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:10,956
I have decided not to
invest in your little city.

627
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,505
Get me to the harbor.

628
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,840
I'm sorry.

629
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,917
Move. Move it!

630
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,808
You! Come here!

631
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,597
For my passage.

632
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,562
Let him aboard.

633
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,943
You must leave now!

634
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,282
Cast off! Prepare to set sail!

635
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,444
Help me! Please!

636
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,671
You...

637
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,590
You have to help us.

638
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,466
You have to save Cassia.

639
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,172
Where is she?

640
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,049
The villa.

641
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,147
- Where are you going?
- I have to find her.

642
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,324
Milo, this is madness!

643
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,326
We have to get to the
harbor and find a boat.

644
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,161
The mountain is going
to kill us all!

645
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,663
She risked her life
for me, Atticus.

646
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,248
Risked everything for me!

647
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,328
Without her, they would have
killed us in that arena!

648
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,086
Then we will go together.

649
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,709
No.

650
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,966
You have your freedom, my friend.

651
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,669
Now she is mine.

652
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,215
Then we meet at the harbor.

653
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:58,889
At the harbor.

654
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,095
Please, give me the keys!

655
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,934
Cassia, they've taken the keys!

656
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,163
No!

657
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,192
Where is she?

658
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,204
Water!

659
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,424
You came back for me.

660
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,893
Drink. Drink.

661
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,571
Thank you, sister.

662
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:54,939
No!

663
01:16:58,531 --> 01:16:59,903
No!

664
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:12,461
Look at me.

665
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,838
We have to get to the harbor.

666
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:36,435
This is suicide. Turn around! Back!

667
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,236
Out of the way!

668
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,189
Get out of the way!

669
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:56,296
Enough!

670
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:58,423
Kill them! Kill them all!

671
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,678
Row, you idiots! Row!

672
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,847
Turn around! You have to turn back!

673
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,890
Come on. Get up! Get up!

674
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:23,067
No! No, my daughter!

675
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,360
Getup!

676
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,445
No!

677
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,864
My daughter!

678
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,533
Mommy! Help!

679
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,078
Is this the end of the world?

680
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,584
Why would the gods let this happen?

681
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:21,329
- Milo!
- Atticus!

682
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,247
I knew the gods would
never catch you.

683
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:26,543
There's none faster.
And now I see why.

684
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,420
- It's time to go, my friend...
- No.

685
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,297
The harbor's gone. We
have to find another way.

686
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,132
Then we have to go
south into the hills.

687
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,960
It's too far. We'll
never make it on foot.

688
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,887
Then we go there.

689
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,589
The arena? Why?

690
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,474
Horses.

691
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,822
My parents.

692
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:05,164
I'll get the horses.

693
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:13,923
Don't.

694
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,794
Go help your friend.

695
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:04,015
Atticus?

696
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,522
Romans everywhere.

697
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:32,206
Let's go.

698
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:40,718
You better get
comfortable, my dear.

699
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,927
It's a long way to Rome.

700
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:43,012
Why are you doing this?

701
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,889
Because the property of
Quintas Attius Corvus

702
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,599
will not be taken by some slave.

703
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,434
Proculus, there's not
enough room for you.

704
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:50,144
Then I shall see you
in Rome, Senator.

705
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,562
Corvus!

706
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:58,069
1,000 dinari to the man who
brings me the head of that slave!

707
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,567
Hyah! Hyah!

708
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:25,596
This is mine now. Go.

709
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:26,722
Atticus...

710
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:28,925
Every second takes her
further away from you.

711
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,102
I'll see you again, brother.

712
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:50,743
Hyah! Hyah!

713
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,461
Hyah!

714
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,083
Hyah!

715
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,321
Hyah! Hyah!

716
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:39,920
Hyah!

717
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,923
Hyah!

718
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:29,345
Go on!

719
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,962
A barbarian does not die

720
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:06,337
the equal of a Roman.

721
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,460
Equal!

722
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,281
Let's see if a Roman

723
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:34,660
can die the equal of a gladiator.

724
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:39,532
No!

725
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,293
Please. Please.

726
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:46,380
Gladiators do not beg.

727
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,859
Hyah!

728
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,614
Bitch! You bitch!

729
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:08,916
Wait! Wait! Wait!

730
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,918
Who are you to do this to me?

731
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:13,872
I am Senator Quintas Attius Corvus!

732
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,549
And what is that worth,

733
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:20,924
Senator Quintas Attius Corvus?

734
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,899
You killed my family,

735
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:36,944
you slaughtered my people,
and make no mistake,

736
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,697
my gods are coming for you.

737
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:53,786
Wait!

738
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:57,419
You can't leave me here!

739
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:49,676
For those of us about to die...

740
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:53,141
We salute you!

741
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:59,443
I die a free man!

742
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,445
You have to ride him out of here.

743
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:45,023
- No!
- He's not fast enough.

744
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,324
He can't carry us both! Go!

745
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:48,992
No, I won't leave you!

746
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:50,866
We don't have a choice.

747
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,366
Run! Go!

748
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:01,122
I don't want to spend our
last moments running.

749
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:11,257
Don't look.

750
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:14,515
Look at me.
