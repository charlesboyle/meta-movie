00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,679
<i>Å? I can't be
held responsible Å?</i>

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,599

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,319

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,239

00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:46,439
<i>Å? No name there
on no hull Å?</i>

12
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,089
<i>Å? And it's not
a strain at all Å?</i>

13
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,439

14
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,879

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,199
<i>Å? Right here beside me now Å?</i>

17
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,969

18
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,439

33
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,119
<i>God will forgive them.</i>

34
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,679
<i>He'll forgive them
and allow them into heaven.</i>

35
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,319
<i>I can't live with that.</i>

36
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,569
Fancy
you don't mess about

37
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,769
with that fire, mate.

38
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,399
No.

39
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,609
Here you go, mate.

40
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,929
I'll help you in.

41
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,089
I've got to go to--

42
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,969
Oh, you did
well there, lad.

43
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,719
You've really
earned that.

44
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,009
Anthony. Anthony.
Hey, all right, mate!

45
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,329
Just do me
a quick favor, mate,

46
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,809
on the way down
to the shop, all right?

47
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,049
Oh, no, I've got to go
towards Stiletto.

48
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,999
It'll take you 5 minutes.
Now, come here!

49
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,919
Here's one, bro.

50
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,769
Morning, Gage.

51
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,129
All right.

52
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,609
Fucking great
pills, man.

53
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,449
Yeah, I'll have
to do you for that.

54
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,969
That's 15 for
the single one.

55
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,289
Fucking go
gambling, mate?

56
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,689
All right, man.

57
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,649
Enjoy yourself, man.

58
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,889
Okay, Weir.

59
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,009
Yeah,
can I have two?

60
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,289
Sweet.

61
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,919
Cheers, Gage.

62
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,929
Can I help you, mate?

63
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,169
Sorry?

64
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,809
What the fuck
are you looking at?

65
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,439
At you, ya cunt!

66
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,879
See you
in a bit, yeah?

67
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,369
Hang in. Hang in.

68
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,929
I ain't gonna
fucking do it, am I?

69
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,609
Don't worry.

70
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,239
I likes you anyway.

71
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,119
Å?

72
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,599
Sonny.

73
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,249
Cheers, man.

74
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,649
Have any more?

75
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,809
No, I don't, man.

76
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,929
Taste that beer
before you drink it.

77
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,809
It just isn't
enough, admit it.

78
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,889
Just seen old Jane in town.

79
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,849
Have you?
Mmm.

80
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,329
Good man.
Deal 'em out.

81
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,409
She had a hot
skirt on.

82
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,569
She's
randy for you.

83
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,129
She might as well
not wear anything.

84
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,369
Really?

85
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,799
I'll be on my floor
tonight on that skirt.

86
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,289
See you happy
chaps later.

87
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,449
10:00 about.

88
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,329
Don't get pulled.
I won't.

89
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,719
Take it easy, Herb.
See you, mate.

90
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,929
Sorry about
over there, mate.

91
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,249
I really just
lost the head there.

92
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,289
I don't know what
happened to me.

93
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,249
I just don't know
what come over me.

94
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,249
Sorry. Shouting at you
was the wrong thing.

95
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,289
It's all right, man.

96
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,649
What's your name?
It's Herbie.

97
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,889
No. What's your name?

98
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,449
No, it--it is.
I'm called Herbie, man.

99
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,369
Whoa, me, I'm really sorry.

100
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,969
I'm really ashamed of myself
for losing control.

101
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,969
Okay, mate.
All right.

102
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,649
Under the bridge water.

103
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,849
Yeah.

104
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,769
Let it flow.

105
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,399
All right, mate.

106
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,889
They spit-roasted
me on video.

107
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,169
Sense of life, man.

108
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,249
He's still alive--

109
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,889
"Janie and Rebecca
loving--

110
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,529
"getting each other off
at the shower time,

111
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,249
and they really want
you to join in."

112
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,849
I would if I had a shower.
You know what I mean?

113
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,649
Oh, Jesus.
I love English cock.

114
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,929
Do you?

115
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,689
You guys have
really tasty spunk.

116
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,129
Oh, she's
a little slut.

117
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,559
Dirty cow.

118
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,409
Not today, thanks.

119
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,529
Herbie, dickhead.

120
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,289
Yeah, all right.

121
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,439
Herbie.

122
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,369
"Janet loves
alfresco fun,"

123
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,289
so why not join her
as she spreads herself

124
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,329
"wide in the open air?"

125
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,489
What's alfresco?

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,409
Alfresco, that's
up your anus, ain't it?

127
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,039
Is it?
In the anal.

128
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,449
"Fancy a tit fuck?"

129
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,009
No, thanks.

130
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,449
"I love taking
his cock deep

131
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,289
so his shaven balls
are in me face."

132
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,649
Hi, chaps.
Righto.

133
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,409
Herb. Herbie.
Herb, Herb.

134
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,529
Hey, I'm all skin up.
Man, I got some gear.

135
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,489
Yeah, put it together.

136
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,689
Let's do some
of Sonny's gear.

137
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,169
You need to chill out a bit.

138
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,289
Don't take fucking
much elation.

139
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,049
Uh, you've had
enough of that.

140
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,969
He's checkin the stuff
and don't touch the acid.

141
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,849
Don't touch the acid.

142
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,049
Fuckin' hell. I was
in farm today, man.

143
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,409
Listen, Tuff.
Was in farm.

144
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,649
I'm listening.
I'm listening.

145
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,169
Doing me dealing, right?
You know what I mean?

146
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,289
Had to scout about and stuff,

147
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,969
and as soon
as I waltz in,

148
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,089
there was this
fucking bloke

149
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,049
having a bit of
a butcher's at me.

150
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,369
Went over, like, "Do you
want a fucking picture?"

151
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,209
What's going on?"
He's like, "Huh?"

152
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,809
Mongrel can hardly speak.

153
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,249
And then I says,
"Listen.

154
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,009
What the fuckin' hell
are you looking at?"

155
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,129
He goes,
"You, you cunt!"

156
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,009
Get out.
Seriously, man.

157
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,769
So I go down to club
seeking Sonny, don't I?

158
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,729
So I'm coming out--

159
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,849
coming out back
of the club.

160
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,289
You know where
the stairs are?

161
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,569
Yeah.

162
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,689
Was on me phone.

163
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,329
Next minute, "Aah,"
he's right there.

164
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,049
I'm fucking
like a ghost, man.

165
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,689
What that?

166
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,849
Faint now, dead.
Know what I mean?

167
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,329
So I faint now.
Know what I mean?

168
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,409
Were you sweating,
though?

169
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,889
I was like whoa, but he
starts apologizing.

170
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,649
The guy comes
up to you,

171
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,289
more or less
threatens you.

172
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,529
Then he jumps
out on you

173
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,449
going to fucking work,
and you shake his hand?

174
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,889
That's what I mean.
Freaky, innit?

175
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,849
No, you're
fucking freaky.

176
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,969
You know what
I think it is?

177
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,129
I've been racking me
brains all bastard day.

178
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,609
Yeah, it's a local
lunatic, innit?

179
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,919
Hey, Tuff.
Anthony's brother.

180
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,599
It was Anthony's
brother, man.

181
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,809
Stop it!
Don't crowd him.

182
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,489
Don't crowd him,
all right?

183
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,889
You're making him
nervous.

184
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,169
I know you got to go,

185
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,369
but let me just say
one thing, all right?

186
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,929
I don't mind.

187
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,049
I just don't like when
people are just fucking rude.

188
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,289
You know what I'm saying?

189
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,249
I'm sorry I hit you before.
I didn't mean to.

190
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,089
Yeah? There's no
blood, is there?

191
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,369
Huh? Huh?

192
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,769
Yeah!

193
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,369
That isn't a bloodstain.

194
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,449
That isn't
a bloodstain, is it?

195
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,929
At this pace,
it'll give you

196
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,679
the appetite
of an artist.

197
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,519
No, no, no.
Trust me.

198
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,729
I don't like
one of these things here.

199
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,319
Blow for me, mate.

200
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,329
I don't want him
to do any more.

201
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,609
Oh, come on, man.

202
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,369
He don't want
to do any more.

203
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,529
No, but listen.

204
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,439
What you got to do is,
if you do want...

205
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,889
Has he gone?
Did I miss it?

206
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,409
Did I miss
the other one?

207
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,769
He's real
fucking paranoid.

208
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,209
Come on.

209
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,039
Keep your hands
off of him.

210
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,519
It was weird in town
today, weren't it?

211
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,969
Weren't it?

212
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,729
Don't change,
does it?

213
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,609
No, sure as shit no.

214
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,239
No, it weren't.

215
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,609
What are them little
lines in your hair?

216
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,129
What, them?
Mm.

217
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,169
You did them.

218
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,089
I certainly did not.
Yeah, you did.

219
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,769
No, I didn't.
When you cut it.

220
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,489
Are you trying to
look like a gangster?

221
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,969
No, I'm gonna
grow it anyway.

222
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,409
What are you
growing it like?

223
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,729
Don't know. Long hair.

224
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,849
Like Bon Jovi.

225
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,479
No.

226
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,769
I'm gonna have to go

227
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,329
back to town in a bit,
mate,

228
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,169
to sort some
business out.

229
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,079
I don't want
to go, Richard.

230
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,249
You don't have to.

231
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,569
Is that Sonny's
stuff, yeah?

232
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,769
He's gonna go mad.

233
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,929
He's not gonna
go mad.

234
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,129
Sonny can share.

235
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,329
Oh, no, man.

236
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,289
We got to do an experiment
for the mix.

237
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,769
And you have been chosen
as the lead astronaut.

238
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,649
Fucking opinion
as a connoisseur.

239
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,929
Go on, have
a go at that.

240
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,249
Whoa, what you up to?

241
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,249
Come on, give me it.
Come on. Come on.

242
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,729
Let me into
your thoughts.

243
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,289
It's an interesting one,
this.

244
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,529
Give me your thoughts.
Come on.

245
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,049
Don't think
about it too much.

246
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,809
Byzantine period.

247
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,769
Byzantine period.

248
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,969
I'll give you
a clue, man.

249
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,289
Italy.

250
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,769
Italy?
Italy.

251
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,129
It's for the Italians.
It's for the Italians.

252
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,729
But you say that now.

253
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,649
<i>Å? It's amore Å?</i>

254
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,969
It's fucking
parmesan cheese!

255
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,689
You dirty bastard.

256
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,369
Fuck off.

257
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,449
Fuck you.

258
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,889
All right, I'm off.

259
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,009
I'm off, Gage.

260
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,249
Are you sure
you can make it?

261
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,449
Yeah.

262
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,409
I'll strut my way
and all that.

263
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,769
You must be
fucking cursed.

264
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,089
I'll fucking
nightmare you.

265
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,569
See you in a bit, yeah?
See you in a bit.

266
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,729
Hey, take care.

267
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,009
See you in a bit.

268
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,289
Say hello to Sonny.

269
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,369
Yeah, I will, mate.

270
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,849
Oh, man, he's off
his fucking trolley.

271
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,479
Have you seen him?

272
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,919
Fuckin' hell.

273
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,889
Fuckin' hell, man.

274
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,009
Fuckin' hell! Tuff!

275
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,639
Tuff!

276
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,409
Listen!

277
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,689
There's a man
standing at the door

278
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,889
with massive eyes.

279
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,569
It looks like his
fucking eyes are on fire.

280
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,199
Come on. Come on.

281
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,209
He was still down there.

282
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,209
Shh!

283
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,689
He was--He was
still there.

284
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,289
He had a mask.
He had a mask.

285
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,849
His eyes were massive!

286
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,489
Like an elephant.

287
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,649
Well, where is he?

288
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,529
He was still there
when the door closed.

289
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,929
He had this big
suit on, man.

290
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,009
Massive eyes, man,
I'm telling you.

291
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,289
You think this is
funny, Herbie?

292
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,689
You guys really run
around like fools,

293
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,209
either of you.

294
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,649
I ain't jokin'.

295
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,129
What can I say?

296
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,809
I'm not
making it up!

297
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,169
He had massive eyes!

298
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,929
I'm stopping
here tonight.

299
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,409
You're not stopping
at my house.

300
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,039
I'm stopping here.

301
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,329
Just let me
stop here!

302
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,049
I'm not gonna
piss about, am I?

303
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,649
Get your fucking
stuff and get--

304
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,049
Fuckin' hell, man.

305
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,489
What the fuck's that?

306
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,569
What the fuck was
I telling you?

307
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,129
He fucking broke
into me fucking flat.

308
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,609
Hey!
Hey!

309
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,849
Where's Sonny's gear?

310
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,249
We'll find you,
bastard!

311
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,449
What's up?
Where's Sonny's

312
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:26,929
gear, man?

313
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,369
We'll find you!

314
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,329
Fuckin' hell.

315
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,329
Where was it, man?

316
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,729
It was on
the fucking table.

317
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,009
Where's Sonny's gear?

318
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,969
Check your pockets.
Check your pockets.

319
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,009
I don't fucking
have it.

320
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,609
I didn't go out
with it, did I?

321
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,849
Check 'em anyway,
you twat!

322
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,969
These just fell down.

323
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,929
Haven't got the food.

324
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,689
What was her name?

325
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,889
Cynthia.

326
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,809
No. Ruby. Ruby.

327
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,289
No.

328
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,689
She had a break,
and it broke in two.

329
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,969
That was a dog.

330
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,929
She's a fucking dog!

331
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,369
Spoke with her
for 2 1/2 hours.

332
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,969
You lay the fuck off.

333
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,329
You fell asleep.
You fell asleep.

334
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,239
Fell a-fuckin'-sleep.

335
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,049
Get in the door.

336
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,729
You fell asleep.

337
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,049
Listen, you fuckin' A.

338
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,679
<i>Å?</i>

339
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,569
<i>Å? It's all right Å?</i>

340
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,449
<i>Å? I'm feeling strange Å?</i>

341
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,599
<i>Å? When monkey ran high Å?</i>

342
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,809
<i>Å? I feel it coming Å?</i>

343
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,559
<i>Å? Something new Å?</i>

344
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,409
Å? Never thought I'd find
another man like that Å?

345
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,369
Å? Yeah Å?

346
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,999
Å?

347
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,959
Man, I was
enjoying that.

348
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,929
Right, Herbie, I think you
better tell him, innit?

349
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,889
I've gotta tell him?

350
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,009
It's your story.

351
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,649
Well, I know.
You guys can help tell it.

352
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,289
Well, we don't know it, do we?
We don't know the story.

353
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,449
Just tell him
the gear's gone.

354
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:39,969
End of story.

355
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,889
Full stop.
Straight in

356
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,329
with that.

357
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,529
He's gonna think
I'm on it, isn't he?

358
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,169
You're supposed to give him
the bad news first, man.

359
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,489
'Cause you can't
do anything about it.

360
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,409
Just tell him
about the drugs, man.

361
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,169
He's figuring it's funny.
He's gonna go apeshit over that.

362
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,129
The flat's been trashed,
it's been painted

363
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,729
on the wall.

364
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,769
Yeah, tell him about
the elephant, what?

365
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,169
Don't mention
the elephant.

366
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,289
Don't mention
the elephant,

367
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,649
Herbie. Honestly.

368
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,969
Give a shout.
Give a shout.

369
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,289
Sonny, mate?
Sonny, it's

370
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,329
like an emergency.

371
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,489
Gotta tell you somethin'.

372
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,049
Well, he's banging about
now, is he?

373
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,849
We're coming back.

374
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,689
Banging?
What are you--

375
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,049
Who's banging on
the fucking door? You, eh?

376
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,089
What's all here?

377
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,689
I didn't bang
on the door, man.

378
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,929
Well?

379
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,689
Are you all right, mate?

380
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,609
I'm all right.
What you want?

381
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,409
Sonny, we need to
have a word inside.

382
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,369
We'll have a word.
What you want?

383
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,329
Well, go inside, eh?

384
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,209
Best we go inside, Sonny.

385
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,289
It won't take long,
mate.

386
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,249
Get in.

387
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,879
We need to speak
to you.

388
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,929
Eh?

389
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,729
Not out here, man.

390
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,569
All right,
who banged on the door?

391
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,609
I didn't
bang on the door.

392
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,049
Herbie, don't--
Who banged on the door?

393
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,249
I don't know.
I didn't bang on the door.

394
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,569
Herbie, I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

395
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,119
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't bang on your door.

396
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,449
Fucking pills
and everything.

397
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,999
How many pills?
What are they?

398
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,329
Put a few of these in?

399
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,449
Yeah.

400
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,369
Do you know why people
give kids drugs?

401
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,089
So they can
control their minds.

402
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,559
Because they're fucking
weak-minded themselves.

403
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,449
They're not even
animals, mate.

404
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,439
Fuck it.
I'll just put all that in.

405
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,529
Look at that, mate.

406
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,329
Fuckin' hell.
That's acid.

407
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,329
Yeah.

408
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,929
What you gonna
do with it?

409
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,809
I'm gonna give 'em
a super-duper fuckin' dose.

410
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,209
I'm gonna send 'em
to space, man.

411
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,169
Yeah.
Mmm.

412
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,309
This spaceship ain't fucking
coming back though, baby. -No

413
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,569
Cheeky bastard, though,
wreckin' our flat.

414
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,569
Did you see
what he did to his face?

415
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,889
Come in and
put that on his face.

416
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,249
He don't even nit-know,
do you know what I mean?

417
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,169
You know what I think,
he's maybe fuckin'

418
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,929
mental bastard--

419
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,169
If he can get in here
and do that one--

420
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,209
He can do what he wants.
He's trained, man. I told ya.

421
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,009
He's not gonna
buy this story anyway.

422
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,609
He's pissed off.

423
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,849
Oh, here
he comes.

424
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,439
Aye, Sonny.
How's it goin' now, man?

425
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,839
Still a little bit there.

426
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,369
Well, I thought
we had a deal, fellas.

427
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,889
What do you mean,

428
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,329
a deal?

429
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,089
That's not us.
We ain't done that.

430
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,209
He came 'round me flat, man.
He came 'round me flat

431
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,849
and wrecked it.

432
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,529
Put all this writing
on the wall.

433
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,329
Smashed me lamp.

434
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,409
Have you touched my gear?
Have you been

435
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,489
using my gear, mate?

436
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,889
We went out the flat,
left it on the table

437
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,489
for five minutes.

438
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,129
Hav you been usin'--
I'm not asking you that.

439
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,529
I'm askin' if you've
been usin' the gear.

440
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,449
No, I don't get off
your gear, we sell it.

441
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,089
I don't touch it.

442
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,729
Tuff?

443
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,649
I ain't touched it, man.
I ain't touched it.

444
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,009
He's seen the geezer.
Tell 'em, Herbie.

445
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,969
That's what I'm sayin'.
This guy follows us all day.

446
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,809
We go bang off the edge,
we see the elephant--

447
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,479
It's an elephant? Eh?

448
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,289
Elephant?

449
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,409
Fuck.

450
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,329
Fire away, mate.
Fast as you can.

451
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,689
Go on.

452
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,129
So, at the club,
the other night,

453
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,649
and he said
that and stuff,

454
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,009
he followed me--
Said what?

455
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,009
He called me a cunt.
Okay.

456
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,689
And I saw him
earlier in the day, mate.

457
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,489
Out the back of your club
when I come and seen you.

458
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,169
He was at my club?

459
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,769
Yeah, he was
at your club at the back.

460
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,089
Same fellow?
Same guy.

461
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,449
But I'm thinking
about this all day, man,

462
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,649
'cause it's weird,
you know what I mean?

463
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,089
So that's when, you know,
I went to Tuff's

464
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,209
to just chill out, man,
you know what I mean?

465
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,289
Sort me head out and stuff.

466
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,089
And that's when
I come downstairs,

467
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,569
and this thing's there,
it's right there

468
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,289
at the glass, mate.

469
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,249
What's this thing?

470
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,249
This elephant thing.

471
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,529
Fuckin' hell.

472
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,809
I told him not to mention
fuckin' elephants.

473
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,929
Now, the problem I have
is my gear's gone,

474
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,649
and you're talkin'
about elephants, okay?

475
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,009
Just nice and easy,
tell me what it is,

476
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,929
and we'll deal.

477
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,889
I'm saying--

478
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,169
Who is the elephant man?

479
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,089
It's-- It's--
Anthony's brother, innit?

480
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,249
It's Anthony's brother.

481
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,649
I swear man.
I swear, it's Anthony's

482
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,769
brother Richard.

483
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,039
Hello. Hello.

484
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,609
...and you talked to me,
and you become my friend,

485
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,929
and then you let
these fucking idiots

486
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,969
maul you and touch you
and feel you?

487
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,289
What's wrong with you?

488
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,289
You know why
your brother left?

489
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,249
Because you are a retard.

490
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,929
That's what he told me.
That's what he told

491
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,609
the neighborhood.

492
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,889
"My brother Anthony
is a fucking retard,

493
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,209
"so I'm going to go
into the army

494
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,529
and I'm gonna run
a fucking million miles away."

495
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,329
I'm telling you,
you are fucking

496
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,409
difficult to deal with.

497
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,009
And when you're here,
you've got to abide

498
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,049
by my rules.

499
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,009
Okay?

500
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,049
Well, here I have
a special game for you.

501
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,569
It's a very special
game, okay?

502
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,129
We play Anthony
sucks Sonny's dick.

503
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,289
I put this big cock
in your mouth

504
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,369
and you suck it.

505
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,569
You wanna play that game?

506
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,569
Or if you don't
wanna play that game,

507
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,089
you can have
the mystery prize.

508
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,649
Now what's it gonna be?
Huh? What's it gonna be?

509
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,369
You have got
three seconds to answer.

510
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,169
It is suck my cock
or mystery prize.

511
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,689
What you wanna play?

512
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,529
1, 2-- What is it?
What do you want to play?

513
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,439
I'll play the mystery--

514
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,919
You're such
a fuckin' idiot.

515
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,449
Does it work?

516
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,129
No, it's
a piece of shit.

517
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,449
Oh, that's
a shame.

518
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,569
Don't go climbin' in it.

519
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,359
No, I won't.

520
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,169
Look at that.

521
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,249
I think I could use that...

522
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,209
for somethin'.

523
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,169
Proper, that.

524
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,049
It's a bit blunt.

525
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,639
Blunt.
It's old.

526
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,009
Did you see him?

527
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,009
Well, I didn't
actually see him, no.

528
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,089
But Herbie saw him.

529
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,649
I mean, he was
fuckin' scared, man.

530
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,249
I've not seen him.
We were outside the flat

531
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,849
when he did it.

532
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,809
It's only Herbie
who's seen him.

533
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,889
I mean,
how did he get here?

534
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,849
Do you know what I mean?
He's clever, man.

535
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,889
How's he got in here?

536
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,009
How clever is that?
Do you know what I mean?

537
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,169
He's done his flat
in three minutes.

538
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,449
Sorry to barge in.

539
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,169
Just want a quick word
with these three twats!

540
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,649
What the fuck
are you on about?

541
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,729
We had an agreement.
No pissing about.

542
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,609
Right? Well, who's
done that, you twats?

543
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,609
What's so
bloody funny, eh?

544
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,809
It's not just that.

545
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,249
Find out how did that,
you fuckin' twats!

546
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,409
Find out--

547
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:59,319
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!

548
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,809
Shut up, will you?
Shut up!

549
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,049
I'll tell him
in me own time.

550
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,409
Herbie tells us
we have a little

551
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,649
visitor in town.

552
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,089
Tell him what
we have, Herbie.

553
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,569
Anthony's brother's back.
That's who it is.

554
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,129
He's messing with us.

555
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,809
If you're winding me up,
you twat...

556
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,049
No, he's like

557
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,009
a commando, man.

558
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,329
Hang on.
Hang on.

559
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,449
Coming through
the window.

560
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,889
Sonny, are they
telling the truth?

561
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,329
Are they right or what?

562
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,409
Who'd have the balls
to do that? Eh?

563
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,049
What's it say, man?

564
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,049
Never mind what it says.

565
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,529
Eh, listen,
you pikey cunt.

566
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,289
Shut up.

567
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,769
What about the girl?

568
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,089
Aye. Patti?

569
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,329
Yeah. Where's she?

570
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,849
She's a fucking slag, man.
Big-mouthed slag.

571
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,519
Yeah, big mouth.
Someone's...

572
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,729
You're having a laugh.

573
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,689
No, I'm not.

574
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,329
I'm not fucking Norma.

575
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,169
I mean--
No, I'm not doing it.

576
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,169
Now can I go
downstairs, please?

577
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,729
If that is your choice,
what can I do?

578
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,089
What can you do?

579
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,449
Get out!

580
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,569
You give my fucking
set of keys?

581
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:13,889
What keys?

582
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,169
No, Sonny! Please!

583
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,729
Don't lie to me, Patti.
Don't lie to me.

584
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,369
I'll do it! Ah!
I'll do anything!

585
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,519
You wanna fuck him?
Huh, do ya?

586
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,959
Hey. It's been
a while, hasn't it?

587
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,969
There's all my boys. Yay!

588
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,409
That's a cute
little urchin.

589
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,889
She's a sweetheart.

590
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,849
What are you doing there?

591
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,129
What are you doing there?

592
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,289
Get him out of my home.

593
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,249
Where's your key?

594
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,209
He's behaving.
He's sane.

595
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,119
Just do as your told.
Tell me the truth.

596
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,959
Ah! What are you doing?

597
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,089
Not shagged.
No one's squatting.

598
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,209
Please, just--

599
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,929
You look your age.

600
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,559
You can piss off, you.

601
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,969
She sounded honest, right?

602
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,449
Cow! It's only
a fucking shag!

603
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,359
A fucking shag
with a--fucking hell!

604
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,679
Congratulations.

605
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:19,119
No, you ain't going anywhere.
We have things to do.

606
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,369
Whoa! Slow the car!
Slow the car!

607
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,249
He's fucking there!

608
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,479
Go down there, boy.
Back up.

609
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:41,119
Just stay here, all right?
I'll do this.

610
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,849
Hey man,
how you doin'? Rich.

611
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,489
You okay?

612
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,129
Mm-hmm.

613
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,169
Yeah?

614
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,889
You know the lads had
this ridiculous idea th--

615
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,889
Yeah, it was me.

616
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,769
Oh, it was? Thought so.

617
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,489
What are you up to?

618
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,209
Moochin' about.

619
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,129
Moochin' about?
In my house?

620
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,169
Mmm.

621
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:20,399
Do you always
paint men like women?

622
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,529
What are you doin',
lad?

623
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,489
That's my concern.

624
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,729
Not with me in my house.
Where are you staying?

625
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,729
Motson's farm.

626
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,369
Gonna come
and see me, are ya?

627
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,409
Maybe I will.

628
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,729
Oh.

629
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,209
You're not
afraid of me, are ya?

630
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,729
Why doesn't he
just chin him?

631
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,049
He's weighing him up.
He's weighing him up.

632
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,489
Shut up.

633
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,089
You're making me
very nervous, Richard.

634
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,329
Well, you should be.

635
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,289
If I were you,

636
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,049
I'd get in that fuckin' car,
and I'd get out of here, man.

637
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,969
I'd gather them goonies
and get whatever you've got,

638
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,569
and come at me...

639
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,849
'cause I'm gonna
fucking hit you all.

640
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,129
I don't like being
threatened, Richard.

641
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,849
I'm not threatening
you, mate.

642
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,969
It's beyond
fucking words.

643
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,329
I watched over you
when you were asleep,

644
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,729
and I looked
at your fucking neck,

645
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,489
and I was that far away
from slicing it.

646
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,209
You're fucking there,
mate!

647
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,689
So get in that car
and fuck off.

648
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,089
You get to me first.

649
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,839
I just might.

650
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,009
What's he doing?

651
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,249
He's coming back.
He's coming back.

652
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,879
Is that it?

653
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,449
<i>He ain't goin' away, fellas.</i>

654
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,529
It's that simple.

655
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,729
I saw him. I looked
right in the eye,

656
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,569
and he ain't
the same guy that left.

657
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,689
Did he mention us?

658
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,049
Yeah, he did.

659
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,649
He invited us all
over whenever we

660
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,649
wanna go and see him.

661
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,849
Said, "Please
come and see me."

662
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,529
Invite the lads."

663
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,729
Quite poetic,
isn't he?

664
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,089
Fuckin' invited us.

665
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,049
Mental.

666
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,049
Where's he at?

667
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,169
He's at Mottson's.

668
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,889
The farm?
Yeah.

669
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,929
Well, what you
want us to do?

670
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,049
Yeah, I think we just
go up there, and we--

671
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,569
we get him out
of the fuckin' house,

672
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,649
and I take a pop and--

673
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,649
Gonna fucking shoot him?

674
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,049
Anyone who's got any better
ideas, I'd love to hear 'em.

675
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,689
And what will you--
How we gonna get him out?

676
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,849
You can say, "Please come out,
I'm gonna shoot you."

677
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,649
I don't know.
You tell me.

678
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,249
Just say to him
we want the gig.

679
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,809
Offer him some money to--

680
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,729
I think just knock on
the door, get him out,

681
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,969
and I just take a pop.
It's that simple.

682
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,209
Serious shit, Sonny.

683
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,169
What are we gonna do?
What can we do?

684
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,489
Just warn him or something.

685
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,009
He ain't goin' away.

686
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,729
He's gotta get done.

687
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,089
I fucking can't
believe this, man.

688
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,849
I can.

689
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,769
I been awake a bit
too long, I think.

690
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,889
Got any-- Sandwiches'd help,
John. Like, food and-- Yeah.

691
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,169
Yeah.

692
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,009
Help yourself
down at the bar.

693
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,159
Bring some up, will you?

694
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,849
You know I'm
with you, Sonny.

695
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,569
All the way.

696
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,199
You know that.

697
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,839
It's fucked up.

698
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,369
Oh, for fuck's sake,
let's do something.

699
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,609
I'm gonna go
fucking stir-crazy.

700
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,369
Man, come on,
something, anything.

701
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,929
Cards. Come on.

702
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,129
Sonny, game of cards?

703
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,609
Sorted. Come on, John.

704
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,009
Yeah, why not, eh?

705
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,809
Might as well
find us some jelly.

706
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,999
Seems like shit-all
for dinner.

707
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,169
Sonny!

708
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,929
Come here!

709
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:28,999
It's-- It's Timbo, man.

710
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,359
Oh!

711
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,679
Oh, God.

712
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,529
Take care of the latch.

713
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,199
Take care of the latch!
I'm doin' it.

714
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:27,039
<i>Å? Watch the dark
clouds bruising Å?</i>

715
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:37,119
<i>Å? Bellies flushed
with water Å?</i>

716
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,799
<i>Å? They swell
above your heads Å?</i>

717
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:58,759
<i>Å? Pull your coats
around you Å?</i>

718
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:06,919
<i>Å? Feel the wind
cut through them Å?</i>

719
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:13,919
<i>Å? Scraping at your bones Å?</i>

720
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:21,599
<i>Å? Hold her in
the falling rain Å?</i>

721
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:31,439
<i>Å? Hold him like
you've never done Å?</i>

722
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:40,129
<i>Å? Let this be a moment Å?</i>

723
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,409
<i>Å? That you won't forget Å?</i>

724
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,129
<i>Å? That you won't forget Å?</i>

725
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,839
<i>Å? That you won't forget
all your life Å?</i>

726
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,799
<i>Å? Till you die Å?</i>

727
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,729
Good luck, Al.

728
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,559
See you in a bit,
Al, yeah?

729
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,919
Good luck, man.

730
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,159
All right, man.

731
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,249
Oof!

732
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,369
Hello,
pig mud.

733
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,729
He's got an ax!
A fucking ax!

734
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,969
We're sortin'
this out, man.

735
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,129
I'll say when
it's sorted.

736
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,729
We can--we can
sort this out.

737
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,129
We just need
to talk about it.

738
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,529
You've got some guts
coming to my door

739
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,049
in that shape.

740
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,209
I've got money
for you, man.

741
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,809
Sonny, fucking
nail him, will ya?

742
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,489
Fucking nail him.

743
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,689
I'm gonna take
your fat belly

744
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,159
and I'm gonna rub it
in the fucking mud, you gack!

745
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,649
You fucking shot Al,
you twat!

746
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,289
You shot fucking Al!

747
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,609
What the fuck?

748
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,009
You fucking
shot him!

749
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,409
Drive!
Al!

750
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,369
Okay, now.

751
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,489
Al!

752
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,319
Alan!

753
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,439
Fuck this whole thing!
You shot him--

754
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,199
Alan! Alan!

755
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,359
Go on, suck it,
suck it, suck it.

756
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,919
How you feeling?

757
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,919
You can't be sick
off that hit.

758
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,159
I'll sit with him.

759
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,969
Make him stand up.

760
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,609
He needs to get up.

761
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:18,519
Let's see
if he stays, okay?

762
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,409
The fucking gear box

763
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:41,809
is gone, man.

764
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,649
We're fucked.

765
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,889
We're fucking
stranded here, man.

766
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,409
We're gonna have to
walk back into town,

767
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,809
aren't we?

768
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,289
What are you talking about, man?
He's waiting for us.

769
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,369
He's gonna fucking
kill us, man.

770
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,609
Well, where are you
gonna go, man?

771
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,049
There.
Where?

772
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,689
Fucking there, anywhere.
I don't care, man.

773
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,769
That's off in the fucking
middle of fucking nowhere.

774
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,289
We're in the middle
of nowhere with him.

775
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,129
Fucking--

776
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,369
You shot Al, man!

777
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,449
It was an accident.

778
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,009
You saw him, Herbie!

779
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,849
You saw it!

780
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,249
He'll be calling
the police, man.

781
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,929
Herb, come on, man.

782
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,049
Herb, fucking
go with me.

783
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,889
We're better off
in town, man.

784
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,329
Soz, man, come on.

785
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,409
Let's fuck off.

786
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,089
Tuff, man, what am I
gonna do out there?

787
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,369
I might as well be walking
off the edge of a cliff.

788
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,889
Fucking come on!

789
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,889
Tuff, get a grip,
will ya?

790
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,289
Come back
to town with us.

791
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,769
We're all gonna
fucking die with him!

792
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,769
You...fuck off!

793
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,569
You're gonna
fucking die!

794
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,059
Tuff!

795
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,409
Do you remember when
you came to our school

796
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,239
and did that run, Richard?

797
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,129
I do, yeah.

798
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,929
Good day that was,
wasn't it?

799
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,289
Mm.

800
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,529
You was the best.

801
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,769
You made the most money,
didn't ya?

802
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,719
About 300 quid, I think.

803
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,489
Do you remember
when you played football?

804
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,769
I do, yeah.

805
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,089
You was the best then
as well, weren't ya?

806
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,369
Who was that little lad

807
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,209
that kept showing his arse
whenever he got the ball?

808
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,049
That's Michael.
Michael Parks.

809
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,649
They tried to hold me hand,
didn't they, mate?

810
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,889
Yeah, didn't they?
They all held your hand.

811
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,449
I didn't.

812
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,849
I know you didn't.

813
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,999
Don't need to, do I?

814
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,489
<i>Å? When the dust
has settled Å?</i>

815
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:30,049
<i>Å? Will you make it back Å?</i>

816
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:35,159
<i>Å? Our days were numbered Å?</i>

817
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:40,769
<i>Å? Our days were wrapped Å?</i>

818
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:45,809
<i>Å? We fall and we're lost Å?</i>

819
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:51,049
<i>Å? Through alien nights Å?</i>

820
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,639
<i>Å? Today's darkest cloud Å?</i>

821
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:03,319
<i>Å? Was yesterday's light Å?</i>

822
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,199
<i>Å? Afterlight Å?</i>

823
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:23,169
Now we should check
this place out.

824
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,079
Make sure
no one's in there.

825
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,799
Fuckin' hell,
mate.

826
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,599
Here you are, mate.

827
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,329
Sonny, have you
got one bigger, man?

828
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,129
Huh?
Got something bigger?

829
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,809
That's the whole
point, though.

830
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,129
The thing is with this little
fucking thing, these aren't--

831
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,489
You can't see.
You got it?

832
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,809
You know what I mean?
You just put it here.

833
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,929
Just fucking
got it here.

834
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,289
And you just--

835
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,009
No fucking nasty cut,
you know what I mean?

836
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,289
It's proper
army edition there.

837
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,569
We'll have

838
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,249
a look up here.

839
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,569
He's in the fucking
army now, innit?

840
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,329
Huh?
He's in the

841
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,809
fucking army.

842
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,439
Yeah.

843
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,079
All right in here, mate.

844
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,249
Sonny?

845
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,769
What's wrong, mate?

846
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,729
Here's not in here, mate.

847
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,929
There's nothing there.

848
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,649
Are you sure, man?

849
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,489
There?

850
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,199
What's going on?
Hmm.

851
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,009
Fucking Tuff, man.

852
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,209
What's he run off for?
What a fool.

853
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,609
Do you actually think
he's coming to town?

854
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,729
Yeah, I bet

855
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,209
he turns up in a bit.

856
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,329
Shouldn't have fucking
left him, should we?

857
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,729
He's a fucking lazy bastard.

858
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,729
He wouldn't walk
that far, now would he?

859
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,969
Do you want some
in there, Gage?

860
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,089
Just put some
in there, yeah.

861
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,729
Just up to the line.
You see that line.

862
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,729
To the line--Stop!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

863
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,359
Yeah.

864
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,369
Ohh...

865
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,999
Okay now.

866
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,799
I can't me head around it.

867
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,329
The soldier here
is fucking rank, man.

868
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,489
That's disgusting.
I could taste that.

869
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,649
Fucking hell. I can
taste it in me beer.

870
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,449
I still don't feel well
after sitting here.

871
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,049
I'm not fucking going
downstairs on me own.

872
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,329
Got any more
pots for washing?

873
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,449
Here. Put that in.

874
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,129
Right, that's
the recyclin'.

875
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,799
Put them up
for tomorrow.

876
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,529
You may wanna keep
things like this.

877
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,129
Want all of this
to go in the washing?

878
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,209
That's a washing.
They're clean.

879
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,329
They're not
smelly, mate.

880
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,809
Oh, no.
That one stinks.

881
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,529
If I can only
savor this one...

882
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,969
You could if you want.

883
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,169
When your friends
were pot leavers

884
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,369
and you kept half
the things like that,

885
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,929
there could be
a corkscrew there.

886
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,169
What?

887
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,969
You drink those
from the pint.

888
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,009
Well, isn't it
for lager?

889
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,489
Ahh. For lager.

890
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,249
I used to do this
all the time, you know.

891
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,569
Not much lift
in their bollocks.

892
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,529
We'll turn 'em up.

893
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,209
...you behemoth.

894
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,729
Come on.

895
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,809
Now, if you get the plastic,
you see, the plastic's 5--

896
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,449
3 pence, and the glass
is 5 pence,

897
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,569
so if you put the 3
to the 5, you lose

898
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,369
fuckin' money.

899
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,489
You gotta put the 5's
and the 3's separate.

900
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,799
So remember,
the glass is 5.

901
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,729
Have you fed
these fish?

902
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,489
I fed them
this morning.

903
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,049
Yeah?
Yeah.

904
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,009
Does my face
look all right?

905
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,129
I don't feel good, man.

906
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,889
Huh?
Take it off of me, man.

907
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,729
I don't need it.
Take it off of me.

908
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,489
Take it off of me.
I don't feel good.

909
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,049
Take it off.
I don't want it.

910
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,449
Hang on.
I'm done.

911
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,489
I'm outta here.

912
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,049
Sonny, what does
my face look like?

913
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:33,439
Feels like--loose.
Is it blotchy or something?

914
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,009
That's a bit red,
this eye.

915
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:41,289
I'd go and get that eye
checked if I were you.

916
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,569
Have you fed the fish?

917
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,409
I fed them
this morning, man.

918
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,479
One of 'em looks
like a shark.

919
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:54,199
Raaah!

920
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:08,729
<i>Å? Sunny sunny sunny
days with you Å?</i>

921
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:15,049
<i>Å? Sunny sunny sunny
days with you Å?</i>

922
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:20,079
Help. Help me.

923
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,489
You're the devil.

924
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,649
I wish I fucking was.

925
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,009
Jesus.
No.

926
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,759
You a devil?

927
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,039
Jesus.

928
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,329
Don't--
Don't touch me.

929
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,529
Do you like to party?

930
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,129
Get up and fucking dance.

931
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,529
Get up and dance
at my party.

932
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,599
Get your fat up.
Look at ya!

933
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,369
Come on. Come on!

934
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,519
Have a dance.

935
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:20,644
What you laughing at,
ya cunt?

936
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,489
He doesn't know.
He's just trying.

937
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,039
With a mind that's
fucked up for ages.

938
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,329
<i>Did you think you could
get away with it?</i>

939
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,159
<i>You fuckin' did, man.</i>

940
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,309
<i>You can come with me.</i>

941
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,699
Help.

942
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,889
Up. Sit up!

943
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,879
Fucking chin up.
Sit up, man.

944
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,569
Pay attention.

945
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,199
Up on your feet, you.

946
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,519
Whoa. Don't you know
who I am?

947
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,369
Can I go?

948
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:54,519
Well, you're going.
You're going.

949
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,049
Are you going?
No.

950
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:02,279
I'm gonna do it all
for you now.

951
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,289
I'm gonna take it
all away from you.

952
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,369
You just look at me
like that. That's it, mate.

953
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:12,529
That's it. You just stand
there and don't move.

954
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,519
I gotta fuckin'
shut you off.

955
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,329
Hey.

956
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,569
Sit there.

957
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,729
There's something
I want to show you.

958
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,209
It's just
between me and you.

959
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,839
Just stay there.

960
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,319
Wipe your nose.

961
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,329
Open it.

962
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,729
Open it.

963
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,409
What is it?

964
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,039
Open it.

965
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,329
Who is he?

966
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,959
That's not Joe.

967
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,129
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

968
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,329
Do you want
to give him a kiss?

969
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,959
No.

970
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:13,279
Say something to him.
It's your last chance.

971
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,329
Are you frightened?

972
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,489
Want me to close it?

973
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,809
I'm sorry, mate.

974
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,409
Yeah. It's hard losing
somebody close to you,

975
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,039
isn't it?

976
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,209
Do you want me
to show it to you?

977
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,689
Yeah...
Yeah.

978
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,609
What did you do that for?

979
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,239
He tried to run away.

980
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,879
Do you know
why you're alive?

981
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,089
You're a good man.

982
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,089
Yeah.

983
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,719
Yeah.
Yeah.

984
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,849
I'll give you a deal.
You tell me

985
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,889
what I want to know,

986
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,049
and I'll let you live.

987
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,769
Will you?
Mm-hmm.

988
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,399
There's one more.

989
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,489
Where is he?

990
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,809
Where he lives?

991
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,049
No.

992
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,169
Fuckin' hell.

993
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,129
That's them.

994
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,609
That's them in there.
Where's you?

995
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,649
Where are you?

996
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,929
I'm here.

997
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,689
Yeah.

998
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,169
You're here.

999
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,049
Tell me I can go.

1000
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,729
What would you have said?
I'll help ya.

1001
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,329
Well, then...

1002
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,689
I've gone all straight.

1003
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,569
That don't matter.

1004
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,479
West End.

1005
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,289
You fuckin' lying to me?
No.

1006
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,769
I'll come after ya.

1007
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,449
Aye. I know it's West End.

1008
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:52,279
You know I'll come
after you, don't ya?

1009
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,689
That's why I know you're
telling the truth.

1010
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,249
You'll let me live,
won't you now?

1011
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,769
I promised you.
You did, didn't ya?

1012
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,369
Yeah.

1013
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,609
And I don't go back
on my word, mate.

1014
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,729
Honest?
Mm.

1015
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,359
Put it there.

1016
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,649
Eh?
Yeah.

1017
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,279
Not this time, pal.

1018
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,809
That's it, mate.
Let it out.

1019
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,559
Let it all out.
That's it.

1020
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,369
Is that for me?

1021
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,409
No.

1022
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,449
Tell the truth.

1023
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,489
No.

1024
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,449
It don't matter
anyway, does it?

1025
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,489
Does it, now?

1026
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,729
Well, no, not now.

1027
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,049
I wouldn't have done that.

1028
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,449
Oh, no, mate.

1029
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,849
Fuck it.

1030
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,649
Come here.

1031
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,439
Uhh!

1032
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:31,769
<i>Å? There is blood on my face Å?</i>

1033
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:36,889
Å? There is cursed in my eye Å?

1034
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:42,169
<i>Å? There is no one
in the place Å?</i>

1035
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,689
<i>Å? But no one said good-bye Å?</i>

1036
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:56,559
<i>Å? This is how I start
another day in my kingdom Å?</i>

1037
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:08,129
<i>Å? There is hate in my heart Å?</i>

1038
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:13,249
<i>Å? This is how my day starts Å?</i>

1039
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:18,569
<i>Å? There is blood on my hands Å?</i>

1040
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:24,289
<i>Å? From the murder of a man Å?</i>

1041
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:33,719
<i>Å? This is how I start
another day in my kingdom Å?</i>

1042
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,649
Lads!
Yeah.

1043
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,009
Here now.

1044
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,609
I told you an hour.
Where have you been?

1045
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,129
The park.
What's that?

1046
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,369
A mask.

1047
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,809
Take it off.

1048
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:28,009
What are you doing
with that on?

1049
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,609
Where'd you get that from?

1050
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,609
A soldier.

1051
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,369
What?
A soldier.

1052
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,409
What is that?
A knife.

1053
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,929
I know it's a knife.
What you doing with a knife?

1054
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,929
Soldier gave us them.

1055
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,289
What do you mean,
a soldier gave it to you?

1056
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,649
He said he knew Dad.

1057
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,129
He said he knew Dad, did he?

1058
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,369
Really?

1059
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,369
Mark!

1060
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,809
- Mark!
- What?

1061
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:51,439
Come down here now!

1062
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,089
Come on. We're gonna
drive down there now.

1063
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,649
Definitely not
trash diving, is it?

1064
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,609
No.

1065
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,719
Come on, mate.

1066
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,249
You'll know him
if you see him?

1067
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,879
Yeah.

1068
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,729
Hi. Can I help ya?

1069
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,369
Hello, love.
Is Mark available?

1070
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,489
No, he's just gone out
with the lads, actually.

1071
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,569
Oh, that's a shame.

1072
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,489
Can I tell him
who's calling?

1073
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,489
Yeah, my name's Richard.

1074
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,449
I'm an old friend of his
from years ago.

1075
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,409
Was you in the park
this morning?

1076
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,369
Yeah, yeah.

1077
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,449
Did you meet my lads?

1078
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,409
I did.
Absolutely brilliant lads.

1079
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,809
Yeah.
Crackers.

1080
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,969
They are crackers.

1081
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,649
Yeah, they've been
shouted at today.

1082
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,969
Oh, right.

1083
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,569
Yeah, 'cause they
came back with a mask

1084
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,049
and a knife.

1085
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,369
So I was a bit upset,
to be honest.

1086
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,729
It was blunt.

1087
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,409
I know, but it's a bit
irresponsible, isn't it?

1088
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:08,079
I was really worried.

1089
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,129
You're a good mother.

1090
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,809
Yeah.

1091
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,649
Yeah, I am
a good mother.

1092
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,969
Good one, then.

1093
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,729
Sorry. Can I ask your
name again?

1094
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:19,089
My name's Richard.

1095
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,969
And...just tell him
that you called, yeah?

1096
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,529
Yeah. I'll be around anyway.

1097
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,369
Right, okay.

1098
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,329
Anthony's brother.

1099
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,649
Anthony's brother,
right.

1100
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,609
Yeah.
Yeah.

1101
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:34,239
Ta.

1102
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,049
Hello.

1103
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,249
What are you doing
sittin' there in

1104
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:56,569
the dark?

1105
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,249
I'm waiting for you lot.

1106
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,009
How you doing, lads?
All right.

1107
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:03,049
You gonna go upstairs and play
on your computer before tea?

1108
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,679
Okay.

1109
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,409
There's no one up there.

1110
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:10,769
No, that's 'cause
he's been here.

1111
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,609
He what? Do you mean
he's been here?

1112
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:15,169
No, as soon as you left,
he came.

1113
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,249
What? Been inside?

1114
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,329
No, he didn't come inside.

1115
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,689
He was fine.
He wasn't--he wasn't...

1116
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,889
It was a bit weird.

1117
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,569
What'd he say?

1118
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,929
He said, "Tell him
Richard called."

1119
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,049
And you don't know him?

1120
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,289
No, I've never seen him
before in me life.

1121
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,049
Never.

1122
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,529
But he did ask for you.

1123
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,809
He said, uh,

1124
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,289
"He used to knock about with
his brother years ago: Anthony."

1125
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,519
Leave him alone.

1126
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,249
What?

1127
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,649
Hey, soft, man.

1128
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:48,279
What is it, babe?

1129
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,009
What's wrong?

1130
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:51,969
I do know him.

1131
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,809
Get off! Get off!

1132
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:57,799
I know who he is.

1133
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,839
Anthony.

1134
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:08,569
He was just a kid,
just a...young lad.

1135
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:11,649
I mean, he was a simple kid.
He wasn't...

1136
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,089
Do you know what I mean?
He wasn't as--

1137
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,729
He was just...

1138
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,489
too simple to know
what he was doing.

1139
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,249
Until Rich
went in the army.

1140
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:24,569
And Anthony used
to hang about with us, like...

1141
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,689
We just had a laugh with him,
we had a laugh with him.

1142
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,729
But Sonny was just...

1143
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,369
just everything.
Everything was too far.

1144
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,009
Everything he took too far.

1145
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,169
And Anthony just didn't know
what was happening.

1146
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,289
He didn't know where he was.
He was-- He wasn't like--

1147
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,969
He just didn't
understand at all.

1148
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,089
He just--just...

1149
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,209
He didn't understand
any of it.

1150
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,009
We...

1151
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:50,329
all got in a van and...

1152
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:54,319
we were dropping acid and...

1153
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,639
And Sonny gave him some...

1154
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,689
And I could see
it was going wrong.

1155
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,449
I could see-- I could see
Anthony's face,

1156
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,649
and it was all...

1157
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:09,719
He was tripping
out of his mind, this kid.

1158
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:16,319
<i>Å?</i>

1159
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:25,799
You're all right, mate.
He don't mind me.

1160
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,879
Fall in!

1161
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,519
<i>Å?</i>

1162
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,279
Aah!

1163
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:26,279
<i>Å?</i>

1164
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,799
No! No!

1165
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,119
<i>Å?</i>

1166
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,839
Aah!

1167
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,409
Anthony, stop shouting.

1168
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:36,009
Because every time you shout,
your mother gets sick.

1169
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:39,809
And then Richard might
get a bullet in the army.

1170
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,879
And we don't
want that, do we?

1171
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:56,249
Move from there,
you're dead.

1172
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:00,679
Don't fuckin' move!

1173
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,799
Come on!
Get a move on!

1174
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,649
I was the last one--
I could have stayed.

1175
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,289
I could have stayed.
I could have kept with him.

1176
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,609
But everybody got
back in the van.

1177
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:23,289
Left him.

1178
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,729
I didn't want to leave him.

1179
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,559
<i>Å?</i>

1180
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,849
We found him.

1181
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,959
He's killed himself.
He's done himself.

1182
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,999
<i>Å?</i>

1183
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,489
Get up.

1184
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,329
Don't make a noise.

1185
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,959
Get up.

1186
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:44,959
Where are your
car keys?

1187
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:50,129
If you make a noise,
I'll push this

1188
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,759
in your spine.

1189
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,519
Get in.

1190
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:14,279
Here.

1191
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,999
Do you remember me?

1192
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:31,319
Yeah.

1193
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,559
Why have I brought you here?

1194
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,809
This is where
Anthony was--

1195
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:44,289
Was?

1196
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:47,919
When he what?

1197
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:55,439
Come on, have the bollocks
to say it.

1198
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:59,169
Where he hung himself.

1199
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,209
Why him?

1200
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:05,359
'Cause he was weak.

1201
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,649
'Cause he was a spastic.

1202
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,849
He wasn't a spastic.

1203
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:15,719
He fuckin' was a spastic.

1204
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:23,039
He was a fuckin' nana.

1205
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,009
He looked up to you.

1206
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:30,159
Well, he was a fuckin'
embarrassment to me.

1207
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:37,199
What did you do to him?

1208
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,879
What did you do?

1209
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,889
We were--
I said you!

1210
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:51,799
What did you fuckin' do?
Not them cunts.

1211
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,209
I didn't stop it.

1212
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,329
I didn't stop it.

1213
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,209
Well, I wish you had...

1214
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:09,639
'cause you could have stopped
a lot of carnage.

1215
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,449
What do you mean?

1216
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,369
They're all fuckin' dead.

1217
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,809
I executed them.

1218
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:20,199
And you're the last one.

1219
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:28,439
Now I'm the monster.

1220
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:38,129
Was he calling for me?

1221
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:43,879
When you were torturing him,
was he calling for me?

1222
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:48,159
Yeah.

1223
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:54,359
Was he screaming my name?

1224
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,929
Yeah, he was.

1225
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:03,839
He still is.

1226
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:24,959
I love you, Anthony.

1227
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:29,529
I love you, kid,
but I can't do him.

1228
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,449
I can't do him.

1229
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:36,639
I'm sorry.

1230
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:47,999
Take this from me.

1231
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,889
No.
You take it.

1232
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,249
No. I don't want it.

1233
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,569
If you don't take this
knife from me,

1234
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,849
I'm gonna do something
awful with it.

1235
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,479
Take it.

1236
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:06,129
Take it.

1237
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,759
Take it.

1238
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:23,329
You...

1239
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:27,599
you were supposed
to be a monster.

1240
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:32,919
Now I'm the fuckin' beast.

1241
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:40,129
There's blood on my hands.
