2
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:53,141
Approaching Terminator line.

3
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:59,232
Roger that, be advice radio static

4
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:04,822

00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:08,952
....

6
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,827
Seven, three, eleven

7
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,808
Looking good. Landing vector optimum
touch down in t-minus 12

8
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,062
11, 10, 9 ...

00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:06,983
8, 7, 6 ...

10
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:10,529
5, 4, 3 ...

11
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:15,077
2, 1.

12
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,125
Now drop the banners

13
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,754
- All set
- Must we?

14
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:31,097
- The Eagle has landed baby.
- Please keep that fool off the main frequency

15
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:36,312
Are getting a reading on you end too, Sanders?

16
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:40,692
Mission control I can confirm vast
quantity of Helium 3

17
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:47,492
- The reading are stronger this way
- You're breaking up, pls be advice
you may be nearing meteor shower...

18
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:49,578
Adjust to communicate....

19
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,209
No fucking way

20
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,964
Hey Sanders, what do you do with that thing
hopping around over there?

21
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:01,176
I thought you suppose to take
some photos of me?

22
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,494
Washington, have you got a visual on ...
- What was that, Houston?

23
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,124
- Hey Washington, it's Helium 3,
- What?

24
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:31,506
It's Helium 3 mine. Get over here!
Hey there's something over here you need to see

25
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:36,470
No, Sanders! Sanders!

26
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:41,727
Oh god

27
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:53,617
Houston!, Houston! Son-of-a-bitch
I need to get out of here

28
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:32,051
IRON SKY

29
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:01,429
Sieg Heil, Mondjugendunterführerin
Renate Richter!

30
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,138
Heil Hitler.

31
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,571
Boys and girls, please sit down.

32
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:12,513
Dieter, don't you know
where to put your behind?

33
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,954
Since Mondführer's 65th birthday

34
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:20,054
the appropriate salute has been
"Heil Kortzfleischr"!

35
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:24,163
You're such an exemplary boy.

36
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:31,271
Today, we'll start
with the most unpatriotic language.

37
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:34,429
It's the language we need to know

38
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:38,513
when we return to those
who need our help.

39
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:42,044
In English, now

40
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:46,383
Where are we from?

41
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:48,802
- Siegfried.
- The earth

42
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:51,514
and when did we leave?

43
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:54,851
- Brunhild
- 1945.

44
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:59,357
- And where did we go?
- The dark side of the moon.

45
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:02,403
Brilliant

46
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:58,423
THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON DC

47
00:07:58,423 --> 00:08:00,509
Don't try to play dumb with me

48
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,928
It was your bad idea to send
those idiots to the moon

49
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:07,100
- Talk about disaster
- No disrespect madam president

50
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:09,353
but i'm pretty sure it was your idea

51
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,317
It was my great idea have they succeeded,
now it's your stupid idea. Got it?

52
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:18,531
I didn't hire you for stupid ideas
I hire you because of your modest touch

53
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:22,745
Now my polls are in the toilet
and that election is just weeks

54
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:25,915
You'd drop the ball Vivian

55
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:29,670
Now, I need a miracle.
Get me a miracle

56
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:42,519
Actually how was sending those two astronauts
to the moon to getting me reelected?

57
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:47,108
We haven? been to the moon for
fifty years. One of them was black.

58
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:50,696
- Thought it would look good
- Look good how?

59
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,617
Like I said one of them was black

60
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:59,374
Just think of the opportunity we wasted
years ago with that errand boy, Alan Powell?

61
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,835
- Colin Powell.
- That was close

62
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:06,591
- And where are you going?
- The UN, to do my job

63
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:20,984
The Great Dictator
by Charlie Chaplin.

64
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:24,572
It is one of the world famous
short films.

65
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:30,329
which illustrates in ten minutes his
wish that one day, the entire world

66
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,668
that we will be in the great
fuhrer wise and gentle hands

67
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:37,672
- Any questions?
- I have a question.

68
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:48,519
In my classroom we are here to strictly
form a manner in addressing one another

69
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:52,857
To what do we owe the honor
of this visit?

70
00:09:55,945 --> 00:10:00,408
- We capture an earthling.
- Your expertise is required

71
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:25,231
I love sauerkraut.

72
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:29,528
And Volkswagen.
Driving pleasure.

73
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,699
German words.

74
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:37,622
Where I come from we speak
German too

75
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:44,255
You'll be sorry you did that white boy

76
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:55,886
You are a knock-out

77
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:02,144
How do I get out of here?

78
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:06,191
Thanks lady.
Have a nice day

79
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:10,446
No, Mr. subhuman.
This is the air lock

80
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:14,534
No.

81
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:03,888
You may cover up a bit

82
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:08,936
All good?

83
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:20,909
I know a lot of important people.

84
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,621
Even the President of America.

85
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:27,250
If you kill me, then it's really
fuck-up situation

86
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:34,509
You know the president of USA?

87
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:48,151
Thanks homie
I talk to you later babe

88
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:04,589
Question, what is this apparatus?

89
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,259
Look man, how would I know?
I'm just model.

90
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,222
- A model of what? Citizen?
- No, a model model

91
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:14,726
Damn, what's wrong with you two?
Blind or something?

92
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,229
- Shit, I'm pretty.
- Are you part of the short trip
before the invasion?

93
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:22,611
Invasion? Man, you all must be tripping

94
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,740
What is your mission?

95
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,537
Look dude, I just follow the paycheck,
you know what I'm saying?

96
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:34,585
- What is this device?
- That's my kick-ass cellphone

97
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,338
- and a computer.
- What?

98
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:43,053
That's not a computer.

99
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:49,186
This is a computer.

100
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:56,070
No, that's ancient history homie

101
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:34,034
UNTIED WORLD CONFEDERACY, NY

102
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,120
I am telling you once again..

103
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:42,169
One moment we receive conformation
that the ship has landed successfully on the moon

104
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:45,340
The next, all communication stop

105
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:49,553
- The signal simply vanished
- Or you're hiding something from us?

106
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:53,183
Yeah, we are hiding something on
the dark side of the moon

107
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:00,609
I still find it very difficult to believe
that entire purpose of the mission

108
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:04,655
to promote your president
reelection

109
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:07,451
Well believe what you like, we had
the senators spend

110
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:11,956
hundred-of-million of campaigns
to get her elected the dog-shit-post

111
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:16,504
But Mr Secretary, the expenses
involve this time only makes

112
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:18,172
sense if it were a military test

113
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,550
Okay, lets get this clear

114
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,306
The united state has no
military activity on the moon

115
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,726
What about natural resources activity?

116
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:30,771
We know how the US sometimes
mixes the two up

117
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:37,488
- Is there any chance that you are
looking for Helium 3 up there?

118
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:40,200
Helium 3? You just made that up didn't you?

119
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,370
That's so silly

120
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,919
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HQ, NY

121
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:05,148
I assume these are just preliminary idea?

122
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:09,403
Sir, we have a very small delivery window

123
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,322
- Sir?
- Yes, sir.

124
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:16,287
Ma'am, and this is all.

125
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,845
Anyone who does not head of the
department, should leave

126
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:41,443
You idiots.

127
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:46,074
You morons!
That's an insult to morons

128
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:50,413
What is this shit?

129
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:57,588
I have a meeting with the President
of the United States of America.

130
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,507
tomorrow fucking morning

131
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:03,095
Not with the President of Zambia.

132
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:06,307
Not with the President of
the Janitor's Union

133
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:11,105
But with the president of the country
which we all live.

134
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:15,778
Terrible useless idiots.

135
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:23,120
What am I suppose to tell her?

136
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:29,086
That my employees are not
intelligent enough

137
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,841
to be fucking morons?

138
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,894
Are you willing to work with the fuhrer ...

139
00:23:08,894 --> 00:23:13,275
in the name of the fatherland,
stand behind the Wehrmacht.

140
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:20,033
This decision does not resolve all of us ...

141
00:23:21,785 --> 00:23:26,166
Thank you.
I thought my ears would start bleeding.

142
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,585
You're welcome

143
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:44,772
May I ask what you name is?

144
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:47,442
James Washington.

145
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:50,029
- What yous?
- Renate Richter.

146
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:54,159
It is a pleasure to meet you, Washington

147
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:57,038
James Washington.

148
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:01,043
What's wrong with your skin?

149
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:05,214
Come on now please, you have
met a brother before, right?

150
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:10,721
- No, I'm an only child.
- No, I didn't mean like that

151
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:13,016
I meant a black man

152
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:16,479
No and this continues to confuse me

153
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:20,150
because you are much blacker
then we first met

154
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:24,614
Okay girl, look either i'm black
or you're blind

155
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:31,289
Look, what is going to happen to me?
I mean, what with this guy sticking need in me?

156
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,126
- What about that angry dude?
- My father sticking needles into you?

157
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:37,880
That freaking scientist guy? That your dad?

158
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:41,051
And what about you know....

159
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:44,555
Mr. Nachrichten羹bermittlungs-Oberf羹hrer Adler?

160
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:46,850
- I'm sorry, what?
- Klaus Adler.

161
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,980
He's going to be the next fuhrer.

162
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:55,110
And my husband.

163
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,033
Did you lose a bet or
something? I mean....

164
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:04,288
Lucky you

165
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:08,043
Actually, lucky him

166
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:16,637
- I shouldn't even be here
- You cannot leave me tied up like this

167
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:20,976
- Please do me a favor.
- What?

168
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:23,604
- Play a Nazi
- And if I don't?

169
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,736
- They will eliminate you.
- Oh great

170
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,868
Is there a different radio station?

171
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,914
With the upcoming war ...

172
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:41,126
He's back.

173
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:24,872
With the prisoner now is one of us
we go down to the earth.

174
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:29,295
He will help us to find more
telephone computers

175
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:32,590
And then get G繹tterd瓣mmerung flying.

176
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:49,687
UPSTATE, NEW YORK

177
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:18,806
- Can you smell that?
- No. We don? have time to waste

178
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:22,227

179
00:30:22,227 --> 00:30:25,523
What? The President?

180
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:29,361
Come on man, I thought you want me
to take you to Mac store or something

181
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:37,872
You said that you know the President
of The United States of America.

182
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:41,001
Right, of course

183
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,879
That President.

184
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:53,809
May I meet this President too?

185
00:30:56,854 --> 00:31:01,568
Hey, Mrs. Richter, welcome to my planet.

186
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:24,597
- Get the hell out of my property
- You got to get out of here

187
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:53,383
Hold on there Boss man

188
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:56,387
That may not be the sharpest move

189
00:31:56,387 --> 00:32:01,643
Let me go talk to those guys
They know me, I one of them

190
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:03,938
Are you with me?

191
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,277
Now you're talking

192
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:11,239

193
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:25,590
I am happy to see you all man

194
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,178
You all know me.

195
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,557
- Washington.
- I mean ...

196
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:38,940
That ain't one of yours, is it?
Because I... don't take that out

197
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,276
I'm a peace loving brother

198
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:54,668
- Are you alright?
- Do I look alright to you Mrs. Richter?

199
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:58,089
What the hell just happen?

200
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:01,009
You know..

201
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:09,270
No, mother-f way

202
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,740
What did you guys do to me?

203
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:22,202
- I should've told you
- What? That I look like a polar bear?

204
00:33:23,454 --> 00:33:27,542
You two really fuck up
a guy business

205
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:31,547
Idiots, what is wrong with you.

206
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:34,718
We made you Aryan, you one of us now

207
00:33:34,801 --> 00:33:37,471
- You should be thanking us
- Thanking you?

208
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:40,934
What I should have done is let those
brother come here with a size 15

209
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:45,398
put those foot so far up your ass to
can taste the toe nail for 2 weeks

210
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,442
Klaus.

211
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:56,787
Bring me to your leader,
James Washington.

212
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:12,515
Hey, what the fuck?
Excuse me

213
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,436
Get your hands off me,
you mother...

214
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:20,150
- You can use her to you boss?
- Yes, she's the cheese

215
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,945
- And she knows the president?
- Yes, they are really tight

216
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:29,495
Come on.

217
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:35,794
Dirty bastards.
Do you know who I am? huh?

218
00:34:35,836 --> 00:34:39,299
You just kidnapped the wrong woman
The wrong fucking woman

219
00:34:39,382 --> 00:34:44,555
I hope your having a good time
I'll kick your fucking ass.

220
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:58,031
Excellent.

221
00:34:59,073 --> 00:35:01,159
My turn.

222
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:05,540
I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th Reich
We are based on the moon

223
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:09,295
I'm told you know the president
of the United States of the Americas.

224
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:12,006
You will take us to that
the President, because ...

225
00:35:12,131 --> 00:35:15,970
- I have a very special present for him
- For him?

226
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:18,890
Well he'll loved that
He just loves presents.

227
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:21,059
As soon as my mission is accomplished

228
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:24,355
Nazi invading forces
will be called in under my direction

229
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,818
and we will end the good
times for the bad people

230
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:30,529
And how do you propose
to do that?

231
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:34,326
- We will simply eliminate them.
- What?

232
00:35:35,452 --> 00:35:40,208
- Sorry, that is not what we are told
- Renate, I do not think that you ...

233
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:48,427
Yeah. Why not?

234
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,809
Why tell you this woman why we are here
like you keep telling your children

235
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:56,479
I would love to do that

236
00:35:56,604 --> 00:35:58,231
You see...

237
00:35:58,314 --> 00:36:02,403
the National Socialist Party is the party
is the people's party, nothing more...

238
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:07,868
We wish to return to earth
with our message of peace and unity

239
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,538
love through virtue

240
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:13,959
and kindness, for example.

241
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:18,381
We are healthy,
in mind and body.

242
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:22,595
Our spirits are brave and true

243
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:28,477
We achieved that because we are strong,
disciplined in our cause

244
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,148
There is simply no believe
that they can match our ...

245
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:38,489
because peace and unity is the gift
that we bring to all mankind.

246
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:44,664
What you and all earthlings need to know ...
- Yeah, I get it

247
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:49,044
This is good.

248
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:52,549
This is going to work.

249
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:57,013
You, I need

250
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,891
And you ...

251
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:02,561
I want

252
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:06,733
Alright, lets go meet the president

253
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:30,471
Madam President ...

254
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:33,975
here's the miracle
you asked for.

255
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:58,005
- Who is that man?
- He will lead the campaign troops

256
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:10,146
Renate, please ...

257
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:16,988
It's very simple

258
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:19,282
The world is sick ...

259
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,703
and we are the doctors.

260
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:27,584
The world has anemia
and we are the vitamin.

261
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:31,214
The world is weary,
but we are the strength

262
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:35,386
We are here to make
the world healthy again.

263
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:37,972
With hard work ...

264
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:43,437
with honesty, with clarity,
with decency.

265
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:51,656
We are the product of
loving mothers and brave fathers.

266
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:57,705
We are the embodiment
of love and bravery.

267
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:03,587
We are the gift of both
God and science.

268
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:07,592
We are the answer to the question.

269
00:39:07,676 --> 00:39:12,849
We are the promise delivered to all mankind

270
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,939
For that we raise our hand,
to one nation.

271
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,317
We step to the beat of one drum

272
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,822
....of this world

273
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:28,744
We are the people that the children
on our shoulders.

274
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:33,917
In the same way as our fathers
carry us and their fathers before them.

275
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:38,256
We are the one people united and strong

276
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:44,096
We are the one people with certainty

277
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:49,103
We are invincible
and we have no fear

278
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:56,153
Because the truth makes us one.

279
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:15,260
The moon Nazis are coming. What's wrong
with you people, can't you see?

280
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:17,346
Look, I've been there.
I'm telling you.

281
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,645
They have all this moon base
space thing, and they come to take over

282
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:25,607
You must listen because
the Nazis are coming.

283
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:31,280
They coming to get us all. Why
don't you listen to me? I mean ...

284
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,744
Renata

285
00:40:35,828 --> 00:40:38,247
Washington.
James Washington.

286
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:41,376
I'm so glad to see you alive.

287
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,298
Look out young one,
this bitch that make me white

288
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,135
Come on people, help me.

289
00:40:57,814 --> 00:41:00,066
Help me.

290
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:03,070
I save your life

291
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:11,664
So, you're a formerly
dead, black model ...

292
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:15,628
who is now suddenly
a living white hobo

293
00:41:15,669 --> 00:41:19,716
after spending the weekend
on the moon. Is that correct?

294
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:23,471
- Yes, that's correct
- So I was listening

295
00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:29,979
And you are Neil Armstrong after
his sex change. Is this correct?

296
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:33,817
No, that is not correct
You were not listening at all.

297
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,487
My name is Richter.
Renate Richter.

298
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:41,785
I tried to save this man life and
I think he's stupid, childish and ungrateful

299
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:48,085
Ask Mrs. Moon-Nazi here, was I,
or was I not on the dark side of the moon

300
00:41:49,628 --> 00:41:53,383
Yes, Mr. James Washington was
on the dark side of the moon.

301
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:55,719
There, what did I tell you

302
00:41:55,803 --> 00:42:00,684
I am black, but now I'm white. I went to
the dark side of the moon, but i'm now back.

303
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,312
The Nazis are coming to kill us all

304
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:07,734
And you are going to be so sorry
that you don't listened to me.

305
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:15,869
Mr. James Washington,
Why are you sa upset?

306
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:19,249
- Get lost.
- But I didn't understand

307
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:21,835
We make you white

308
00:42:21,877 --> 00:42:25,590
We talked to your National Socialist
Party about peace and unity

309
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:29,303
You people have robbed me of everything.

310
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:32,098
My race, my identity, my career.

311
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:36,312
And I think I am losing my mind too
I mean just everything

312
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,982
Do you know this?

313
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:41,777
Yes.

314
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,328
Come on in. I will explain it to you
Then you'll understand it.

315
00:42:51,664 --> 00:42:55,544
You're a beautiful lady
I'll give you that

316
00:42:55,794 --> 00:42:58,005
You pay for the popcorn.

317
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:02,428
125 MINUTES LATER

318
00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:06,683
What bullshit

319
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:16,070
It was ...

320
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:21,785
- It was so long.
- They could edited down a bit

321
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:25,290
He was mocking the fuhrer

322
00:43:25,707 --> 00:43:29,336
I sensing a lot of nazis you don't know

323
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,925
- But I am a Nazi
- Yeah, I know but you not like

324
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:39,224
Well like them
A bunch of stupid bullies

325
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,145
No, I'm sure they're good boys

326
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,231
and loyal to the Reich

327
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,694
look, they are wearing the symbol of love

328
00:43:48,777 --> 00:43:51,364
The swastika?
Yes.

329
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:53,617
I have never heard they call that before.

330
00:43:53,658 --> 00:43:57,622
No.

331
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:07,718
What we got here, blond hair, blue
eyes, nice rack

332
00:44:07,718 --> 00:44:09,929
Even Hitler will get a hard-on

333
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:16,228
- Look guys, we don't want any trouble
- Get lost hobo

334
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:20,692
- I gotta plenty stories to tell
- Stop that, that is enough

335
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:26,491
What she needs is a good war

336
00:44:26,616 --> 00:44:30,121
A war always make the president popular.

337
00:44:30,162 --> 00:44:34,877
I might be able to help her there

338
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:38,423
What do you mean?

339
00:44:38,631 --> 00:44:42,511
One word from me, and the
invasion will begin soon

340
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:50,563
- You never break character do you?
- No.

341
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,942
I can never be broken

342
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:57,780
- You smell so good.
- The time has come

343
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,286
I will show you my plans.

344
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,039
Come here.

345
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:15,135
Look I want to show you something

346
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:18,056
Oh big fella

347
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:20,684
All work and no play?

348
00:45:26,107 --> 00:45:30,029
Now listen, don't you think
if I strangle the president ...

349
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:32,866
Will the troops stay in line with us?

350
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:38,456
When I ordered the moon invasion

351
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:41,502
It will be quietless bloodshed.

352
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,257
If I eliminate the moon fuhrer.

353
00:45:56,896 --> 00:46:00,484
Klaus Adler.

354
00:46:16,128 --> 00:46:21,802
So Klaus, is the clown joining us?

355
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:25,348
Did you bought tickets?

356
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:31,981
Don't you want to introduce me to your friends

357
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:36,779
Get your hooks off me your
piece-of-shit

358
00:46:37,572 --> 00:46:40,575
I make it worthwhile for you.
Let me go.

359
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:16,195
I am here to tell you that I
have nothing with you or your plan

360
00:48:16,278 --> 00:48:18,990
You Nazi-piece-of-shit

361
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,065
Nazis are stupid.

362
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:22,361
My compliments on your marksmanship

363
00:49:27,325 --> 00:49:32,457
Shame. She was such a nice girl
Just have to kill her later

364
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:35,920
So, it was real?

365
00:49:36,086 --> 00:49:40,759
- All this time.
- Never doubt a Nazi, beautiful woman.

366
00:49:48,477 --> 00:49:51,397
Goodbye, fasionista

367
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:55,277
I have a planet to conquer

368
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:26,608
I will just grab this

369
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,403
Bye

370
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,283
Good luck with the rest of your life.

371
00:50:34,827 --> 00:50:38,122
Unbelievable

372
00:54:10,137 --> 00:54:14,142
Thank you, Kelly.Moments ago
New York has been under attack

373
00:54:14,226 --> 00:54:19,774
Witness claiming seeing hundred of UFO's
appearing suddenly over the city and opening fire

374
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:24,155
Billy get that
Are you getting that?

375
00:54:24,238 --> 00:54:26,992
Kelly, the craft is at least 60 feet across

376
00:54:27,075 --> 00:54:31,581
I'm seeing what appears to be
a weapon of some-kind dangling around

377
00:54:31,581 --> 00:54:35,336
Oh my god it's opening fire
I'm going to hide

378
00:54:35,419 --> 00:54:40,175
There is little or no information.

379
00:54:40,217 --> 00:54:44,347
- Ok you see the thing is, Klaus
- I know this was you doing.

380
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,311
- It's wonderful
- It's wonderful?

381
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:52,399
It's brilliant. I'm a wartime
president now.

382
00:54:52,482 --> 00:54:55,319
All presidents that start
war in their first term of office

383
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:58,698
always get reelected, I was thought,
I have to bomb Australia or something

384
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:03,120
No, you bring me real

385
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:07,125
- Who are these guys anyway?
- Nazis.

386
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:11,965
- from the moon.
- Real life Nazis?

387
00:55:12,048 --> 00:55:15,135
Holy shit, this just getting better and better

388
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:18,264
You a miracles work of thing.

389
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:23,229
They are the only guys we actually
manage to beat in a fair fight?

390
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,943
I'm like Franklin D. Roosevelt.
but no, I'm not spastic.

391
00:55:28,068 --> 00:55:30,613
I knew you'll be excited

392
00:55:30,696 --> 00:55:37,413
So, if you're Roosevelt, who is your
General Patton or MacArthur.

393
00:55:37,747 --> 00:55:40,584
Minister of Defense.
Do you have any thought on this?

394
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:43,212
Send her.

395
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:47,092
- Me?
- Hey you're the miracle worker.

396
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:50,137
Apparently you dodged bullet too

397
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,476
- I wouldn't know..
- What to wear? You think of something

398
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,854
- You're always do..
- Madam President

399
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,799
Ready to face the music?

400
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:31,105
Escape from the Nazis.

401
00:56:49,253 --> 00:56:52,841
Take us upstate
We need to go back to the moon

402
00:56:52,924 --> 00:56:56,512
We?, rhymes with me.
I'm ain't going

403
00:56:56,595 --> 00:56:59,849
- They got a G繹tterd瓣mmerung all around the moon.
- I don't give a damn what they have

404
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:03,396
- I'm not going back.
- You want to look like that for the rest of your life?

405
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:06,274
Great, now this is my fault

406
00:57:08,068 --> 00:57:12,615
- Let me in
- I am no hero, James.

407
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,202
I need you.

408
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:58,506
Did you know how to drive this thing?

409
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:03,888
Well can't be any different
playing 'wing commander'

410
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,641
Lets try..

411
00:58:32,757 --> 00:58:36,804
I swear we do not have nothing on the moon

412
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:38,848
- Japan?
- It is not ours

413
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,600
- China?
- It is not us

414
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,686
It's bloody well not ours

415
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:46,483
- I confess
- Yes, North Korea? Confess to what?

416
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:49,320
The spaceships are ours.

417
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:54,827
Our beloved leader designed
and build it himself

418
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:06,049
- What's so funny?
- All right, North Korea. Sit down.

419
00:59:19,274 --> 00:59:24,113
- So, it was you India, I knew that
- No, no this is a sign of peace

420
00:59:24,197 --> 00:59:27,492
That is the sign of peace

421
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:32,958
These thugs are Nazis
I mean the real, original.

422
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:36,337
They have been hiding
on the moon waiting to pounce

423
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:40,133
My question is, what
you all planning to about it?

424
00:59:40,217 --> 00:59:43,512
We happen to have a little
something of our own

425
00:59:43,596 --> 00:59:46,808
And I'm sure that you'll
be thankful for it

426
00:59:46,892 --> 00:59:53,191
May I present to you tomorrow
exploration ship the USS George W Bush.

427
00:59:57,739 --> 01:00:00,742
Good work, take it to Officer Tyler.

428
01:00:03,996 --> 01:00:07,542
This is trajectory, how your status

429
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:10,254
Commander on deck

430
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:25,398
The hostile fleet's has launched
a full scale aerial attack against the US

431
01:00:25,482 --> 01:00:30,696
These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they
are operating fully within the thermosphere

432
01:00:30,738 --> 01:00:35,744
Each of them approximately carrying 200
enemy vessel and are extremely

433
01:00:36,495 --> 01:00:39,791
Hell have no fury, Mr. Adler.

434
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,921
Alright kiddies let get
this show on the road

435
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,812
Vivian, you look great.
How is it going up there?

436
01:00:56,896 --> 01:00:59,023
Madam President, I couldn't be better

437
01:00:59,107 --> 01:01:01,860
I am packing dozen of mega tonne
of nuclear warhead

438
01:01:01,902 --> 01:01:05,698
which I am going to carefully
place on Klaus's ass

439
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:09,703
- As soon I get him on my sight
- Carry on, kick butt

440
01:01:09,745 --> 01:01:11,956
Let what them baby can do

441
01:01:45,665 --> 01:01:50,171
Working at optimum capacity
Ammunition consumption within tolerance

442
01:02:04,272 --> 01:02:09,695
We going under extremes enemy fires
We need reinforcement right now

443
01:02:12,157 --> 01:02:13,825
What the hell is the meaning of this?

444
01:02:13,909 --> 01:02:16,954
Good day mate this Australian ship, the Indurain 1.
Ready to ass

445
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,041
Spitfire reporting in

Hanging there W
Canada joining the battle

447
01:02:22,795 --> 01:02:26,258
It's a direct violation of international
space treaty that

448
01:02:26,258 --> 01:02:27,759
you all signed, every single one of you

449
01:02:27,926 --> 01:02:30,346
Ready to join the battles

450
01:02:34,101 --> 01:02:36,812
That is suppose to be destroyed

451
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:41,902
It is an outrage, you all
lies just like my ex-husband

452
01:02:42,444 --> 01:02:46,867
- Come down lady, come down
- Don't you lady me, Russian

453
01:02:46,908 --> 01:02:49,328
Okay who didn't armed their spaceship?

454
01:02:49,912 --> 01:02:54,042
Great, great. That's just great

455
01:02:54,126 --> 01:02:56,879
- You all gave me your word
- You always broke yours

456
01:02:56,963 --> 01:02:59,382
We always break ours, this is what we do

457
01:02:59,466 --> 01:03:02,094
Okay fine fine fine

458
01:03:02,136 --> 01:03:06,600
Let just beat shit out of this prick
and talk about the details later

459
01:04:37,171 --> 01:04:39,424
This is beautiful

460
01:04:49,395 --> 01:04:53,859
- Where the hell are we going?
- To the G繹tterd瓣mmerung.

461
01:04:53,984 --> 01:04:56,821
I think Klaus will be there.

462
01:05:05,749 --> 01:05:08,627
What did you think of that?

463
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:11,130
Alright, what about this moon business

464
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:15,010
What you say we going there and
slap around a bit

465
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:19,808
Klaus, baby I coming to get you.

466
01:06:10,788 --> 01:06:15,502
- What the hell is this place?
- This is the G繹tterd瓣mmerung.

467
01:06:15,586 --> 01:06:17,630
It will liberate the earth

468
01:06:17,714 --> 01:06:20,634
Actually

469
01:06:21,051 --> 01:06:24,555
It is the biggest war
machine ever built.

470
01:06:29,311 --> 01:06:34,151
- This is the bridge. There's where I'm going
- I need to find your father.

471
01:06:34,234 --> 01:06:39,074
- Where do you think he at?
- I think you will find him over there

472
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:42,244
Try to sneak in, and please
paralyze the engine

473
01:06:42,578 --> 01:06:48,043
- Or otherwise the earth is destroyed.
- Note to self, paralyze the engine

474
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:52,465
No. You be careful

475
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:55,010
- I mean you know...
- What?

476
01:06:55,135 --> 01:06:58,681
- Because you likes me.
- Right...

477
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,393
Oh, come on, a little

478
01:07:06,316 --> 01:07:08,777
You like me....

479
01:07:26,132 --> 01:07:29,762
We have a visual on the
Nazi fortress, commander

480
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:35,227
Obviously i'm overstated Klaus

481
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:38,356
Alright, everyone,
let get those nukes in action

482
01:07:38,523 --> 01:07:41,777
- I declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone
- But there are woman and children there

483
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:46,116
The United States of America
does not negotiate with terrorists.

484
01:07:51,497 --> 01:07:54,543
- Prime warhead on secondary armament
- Roger that

485
01:07:54,668 --> 01:07:58,923
- Prepare all available warhead on ground...
- Fire the fucking nukes

01:08:01,009 --> 01:08:03,220
Nukes away

487
01:08:39,724 --> 01:08:41,977
Job well done

488
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,868
Do you remember me?

489
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,123
The moon spook you
turn into snowflakes

490
01:10:06,207 --> 01:10:08,961
Oh shit, it's alive

491
01:10:38,373 --> 01:10:43,087
He must have the smallest
dick in the universe.

492
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:53,016
Time

493
01:10:55,895 --> 01:10:58,273
to fight back.

494
01:11:11,956 --> 01:11:19,299
Everyone, take position around this fat fellas
and wait for my command to open fire.

495
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:29,478
- Offensive ground confirmed
- Let her rip

496
01:16:45,123 --> 01:16:48,961
- Washington, do you hear me?
- Where are you?

497
01:16:49,086 --> 01:16:52,716
- You need to shut down the engine
- I'm working on it.

498
01:19:06,967 --> 01:19:09,303
I congratulate you.

499
01:19:10,137 --> 01:19:12,515
High five

500
01:19:14,393 --> 01:19:17,146
Well that was disappointing

501
01:19:20,776 --> 01:19:24,280
Do you think he suffered?
Even just a little?

502
01:19:24,405 --> 01:19:30,538
Vivian, I knew you could do it.
Sensational, all the way. Congratulations.

503
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:34,293
- What's Helium 3'?
- Helium

504
01:19:34,376 --> 01:19:36,170
Did you say Helium 3?

505
01:19:36,295 --> 01:19:40,926
Yes, there like about 15 to 20 giant towers
that are full of these stuffs

506
01:19:41,051 --> 01:19:43,638
- That's ours.
- It is? Why?

507
01:19:43,721 --> 01:19:49,979
Helium 3, will make the U.S. independent
of all energy needs for thousand of years

508
01:19:50,021 --> 01:19:52,899
Yes, it's ours.

509
01:19:53,024 --> 01:19:55,986
Hear me out

510
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:59,616
The moon is American soil
moon flag, star and stripes

511
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:02,202
Who beat the moon Nazis?
We did, well...

512
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:06,875
Well, you help out here and there
but ultimately it is just like WWII ...

513
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:08,961
and who won that?
We did

514
01:20:09,086 --> 01:20:12,298
- You lie.
- Don't believe me?

515
01:20:12,382 --> 01:20:15,594
Watch the movie.
Movies don't lies.

516
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:18,473
Not the shoes, jesus

517
01:20:18,598 --> 01:20:21,226
Vivian, this is the Minister of Defense.

518
01:20:21,351 --> 01:20:25,148
- Defend Helium 3 at all costs.
- Defend against who?

519
01:20:25,273 --> 01:20:27,901
Against everybody

520
01:22:50,329 --> 01:22:56,087
Unfortunately that's the story of revenge

521
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:59,883
Never really works out the way
you wanted too

522
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,596
I feel lonely.

523
01:23:04,555 --> 01:23:08,602
Allowing our hearts,
or we will burn ...

524
01:23:08,727 --> 01:23:13,024
burn in hell,
burning in eternal damnation.

525
01:23:13,149 --> 01:23:15,277
Renata

526
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:19,908
Washington.

527
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,970
You are alive.

528
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:40,851
It's okay

529
01:23:47,609 --> 01:23:50,905
And you're in a way you meant to be

530
01:24:01,627 --> 01:24:06,508
Are you aware you are kissing a black man?

531
01:24:12,307 --> 01:24:18,022
I guess they have a lot of work cut out.
