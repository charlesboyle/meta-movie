1
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,267
Elianna the Powerful...

2
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,353
sorceress, shifter.

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:25,108
Running for her life through a forest she's
never seen until this moment in time.

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,780
Assassins - nameless and without mercy.

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,867
Soldiers of fortune,
mercenaries, hit men.

6
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,706
History is rife
with bastards like these.

7
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,655
You've been bested.

8
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,880
Elianna the
Powerful - sorceress, shifter.

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,926
Running through a forest
in a world she's never seen,

10
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,762
moving against time itself...

11
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,181
to save my life.

12
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,269
And who am I?

13
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,438
All right.
My name is Granger.

14
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,650
These nice gentlemen-
they're after my money.

15
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,777
They're not gonna get it.

16
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,094
There's more where that came
from if you want to keep going.

17
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,304
Jesus, Glenn, chill out!
The guy's trying to help us!

18
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,224
Why'd you go after his nuts like that?
You're right! You're right!

19
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,935
I lost my head a little, Major.
I'm sorry, man.

20
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,648
Yeah, all's fair in a real fight.

21
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,944
But I'm retired.

22
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,948
Help him up.

23
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,326
You all right?

24
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,162
Hey, look, sir.

25
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,998
Kick to the balls aside,

26
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,292
we really do appreciate you doing
these off-hours for the boys.

27
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,127
You boys are all improving.

28
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,797
And I'm willing to keep it up
as long as you keep feeding the gi fund.

29
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,135
Double for you.

30
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,221
All right?

31
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,265
Come on. Don't be shy.

32
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,601
That's good. Some of the kids
can't afford their own uniforms.

33
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,812
You know, one day, one of us
is gonna put you down.

34
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,273
Not very likely, Captain.

35
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,734
Yeah, you're probably
right about that.

36
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,444
Good night, sir.

37
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,946
Good night, Captain.

38
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,825
Wanna grab a beer?

39
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,080
All right, kids.
Line up.

40
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,541
Come on. On the mat.

41
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,629
Good. Take your position.

42
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,591
Good. All right.

43
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,843
We'll see you next week, okay?
Have a good night now.

44
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,261
Be careful, all right?

45
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,554
Get your shoes.

46
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,651
Another year.

47
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,838
Another 365, guys.

48
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,633
And I couldn't tell you
where the time has gone.

49
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,434
Wish I could trade places with you.

50
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,236
To the team.

51
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,663
Until next year.

52
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,807
Where the hell are
you people coming from?

53
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,310
The passage is open.
The prophecy...

54
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,145
We have but seconds.

55
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,376
The prophecy-
It's all that there is.

56
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,177
You gotta be kidding me.

57
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,779
The king's sorcerer.

58
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,034
We have work to do-
posthaste.

59
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,953
We must not be caught outside
the fortress walls in darkness.

60
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,667
The king requests your presence.

61
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,169
Get him up.

62
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,604
Open the gate!

63
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,124
Close the gate.
Close the gate!

64
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,099
I know you can't be here...

65
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,809
alive.

66
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,519
Quite right.

67
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,899
I have passed from this world.

68
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,571
Remember who you're meant to be.

69
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,366
Remember that you must
return to this place.

70
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,704
It was my prophecy to die for you.

71
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,623
It is your destiny...

72
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,085
to be here.

73
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,979
From what I've heard,
you've had quite an adventure.

74
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,397
The king!

75
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,317
You will stand when the king enters.

76
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,411
Well, that's not cool.

77
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,915
Indeed, it is warm.

78
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,292
I mean, it's...

79
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,211
hardly sanitary.

80
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,756
It is blood, not feces.

81
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,176
The blood of a champion.

82
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,305
The blood of the Chosen One!

83
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,853
For the record, it was your...

84
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,065
it was your men-
actually your man...

85
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,608
who did this.

86
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,778
My soldiers were to ensure
that you were not taken...

87
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,073
by the Dark One
at the enchanted place.

88
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,491
Dark One?

89
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,952
The fellow who followed you
through from the Time Beyond.

90
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,917
See, one has mere seconds to follow
the enchanted through the blue fire.

91
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,128
Had the Dark One hesitated,

92
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,589
he would have been
cut in half by its energy.

93
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,300
Or left in your world.

94
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,054
Instead, he chose to pass
through with you...

95
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,390
and our beloved Elianna.

96
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,268
God rest her soul.

97
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,652
All leave save the king's guard.

98
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:10,659
So, what do people call you
in your time?

99
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,539
Granger.

100
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,459
Granger?
That is a most unusual name.

101
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,713
Well, you'd be surprised
how many times it'd get me laid.

102
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,549
"Laid"? What is "laid"?

103
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,596
Oh, you mean to lay with a woman?

104
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,765
You will curb your common tongue
in the presence of the king.

105
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,602
It is inconsequential, Allard.

106
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,313
We're all the same man
underneath our cloth.

107
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,232
Right, Granger?

108
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,777
Yeah. And what's your name?

109
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,238
Other than "the king"?

110
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,115
Insolence!

111
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,242
Now you're starting
to seriously piss me off!

112
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,702
All right, silence!

113
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,662
There is darkness enough beyond...

114
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,373
without casting stones from within.

115
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,459
Take your men, Allard.

116
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,003
I wish to speak with
Granger in confidence.

117
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,715
Aye, my lord.

118
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,851
My noble and trusted guard.

119
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,895
He's a piece of work.

120
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,897
I am afraid...

121
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,775
that I might spend the rest of
my days trying to decipher...

122
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,944
your strange manner
of speech, Granger.

123
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:35,827
And to answer your question,
I was once known as Raven.

124
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,538
Raven?

125
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,248
From the hunter bird, yes.

126
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:45,462
Now you're, uh, the king?

127
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:51,385
Well, that is a story
for many, many glasses of ale.

128
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,851
I see that you still
harbor disbelief...

129
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,437
on how you've come to be in our time.

130
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,857
Yeah, you could say that.

131
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,610
We live in a time of powerful sorcery,

132
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,531
when men, or objects,

133
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:16,827
may be imbued
with wondrous capabilities.

134
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:21,540
Elianna worked tirelessly to open
the gates between our worlds.

135
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,542
She believed as I do.

136
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,378
She gave her life to find you...

137
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,463
and bring you to our time.

138
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:33,135
Our kingdom, our very existence,
is threatened from without.

139
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:37,639
You have been brought here,
as the prophecy has decreed.

140
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,896
With all respect
to your beliefs and...

141
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,898
and her sacrifice, I...

142
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,860
I think you got the wrong guy.

143
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:54,531
Selflessness is a trait
common amongst the uncommon.

144
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,450
Our journey...

145
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,493
has just begun, Granger.

146
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,373
Escort our guest to his quarters...

147
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,543
and make sure that the
doctor attends to his wound.

148
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,669
Aye, my lord.

149
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,674
Come.

150
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,428
Why have I been brought here?

151
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,431
At sunrise we shall speak at length.

152
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,350
But rest deep,
Granger, for tomorrow...

153
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,686
our adventure begins.

154
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,022
Rest deep.

155
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,955
I do not share my king's
devotion to the prophecy,

156
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,166
yet I pledged to honor the crown.

157
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,085
That is why you've not been
hung by the town gallows...

158
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,213
for that reason and that reason alone.

159
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,633
Well, that's good to know.

160
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,262
When the time comes-
and the time is nigh...

161
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,265
I shall be the one to draw
my blade across your skin.

162
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,939
Well, when the time comes,
we'll see what we see.

163
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,607
But until then,

164
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,445
be a good royal bitch
and show me my room.

165
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,968
I began my day with a protein shake,

166
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,762
and now I'm standing
in a medieval sleeping hut.

167
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,019
Acid trips don't get this weird.

168
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,729
Or maybe they do.

169
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,314
I wouldn't know.

170
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,697
No water purification to speak of.

171
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,908
Geez, there's got to be
everything from E. coli...

172
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,870
to dead sheep
floating around in this stuff.

173
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,663
When in Rome.

174
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,968
En garde!

175
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,720
Now it's you and me, knave.

176
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,562
Sorry.

177
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,522
They must have put me
in the wrong hut.

178
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,027
Excellent hardware though.

179
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,195
It is my honor to share your bed.

180
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,407
Well, look, there must have
been some kind of mistake.

181
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,618
I'm, uh, just a visitor here.

182
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,703
From the Time Beyond, yes.

183
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,246
I am honored to share your bed.

184
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,123
Oh, you know about that?

185
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,835
As it is written, so shall it pass.

186
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,462
You are the Chosen One.

187
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,256
Look, um...

188
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,050
Will you cover up for a second?

189
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,762
I shall mentally keep the time.

190
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,598
Look, I don't really need you
in my bed tonight.

191
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,851
But it is my honor.

192
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,980
I'm a little tired to have
a woman share my bed.

193
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,941
Wait. Would you
prefer a man?

194
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,109
I can have the guards summon a man.
No, no, no, no.

195
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,945
No men. No.

196
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,197
Look, I'm tired
and I need to sleep, okay?

197
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,202
Then I will keep your bed
with you for warmth.

198
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,580
For warmth? Okay.

199
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,082
If that is all you wish from me.

200
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,334
I suppose tomorrow is another day.

201
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,585
As it is written.

202
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,379
Hey, do you happen to know anything...

203
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,090
about that prophecy
everybody's talking about?

204
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,051
If I had any information
and betrayed its meaning,

205
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,387
I would be put to death immediately.

206
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,806
Oh. Okay.

207
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,516
Well, I suppose
that it can wait till...

208
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,241
A wound on his head and his arm.

209
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,537
He will lay with me for warmth,
but not for pleasure.

210
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,081
Nor does he require the use of a man.

211
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,458
Tired... and straight.

212
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,379
Yeah, well, so what are you,
Doc, the, uh...

213
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,425
What are you, like
the full-service job, Doc?

214
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,262
Like, medieval crack and patch, huh?

215
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,229
We both agree this is
a little awkward, right?

216
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:40,608
A physician for His Majesty's Royal
Court cannot indulge her pride.

217
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,786
Keep him limber.

218
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,735
I just want you to know that...

219
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,530
as tired as I am, this is really nice.

220
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,784
But it is my honor.

221
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,339
There is to be a fountain
of blood in your days ahead.

222
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,095
You mustn't sleep any longer.

223
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,638
Awaken now.

224
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,057
Danger is at hand.

225
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,142
What do you mean?

226
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,852
It is your fear that weakens you.

227
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,145
Awaken now!

228
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,565
Abomination!

229
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,873
My wound is fatal.

230
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,043
Why?

231
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,087
Why'd you do this?

232
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,798
He said the Holy Mother
has thus decreed.

233
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,800
It is not for my understanding.

234
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,428
They will retrieve
this empty shell alone.

235
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,931
- Who are you?
- Be clear...

236
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,058
I do not ask your forgiveness.

237
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,498
A simple wench.

238
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,417
The gods have been merciful.

239
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,380
The king will need to speak with you.

240
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,202
Leave us.

241
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,205
My lord, the Dark Ones pursue him.

242
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,081
It would be unwise to leave him...

243
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,334
Leave us.

244
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,003
My lord.

245
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,140
You are alive.

246
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,142
That is fortuitous.

247
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,228
You could have just sent champagne.

248
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,396
A wench.

249
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,817
Like a thief in the night did she
intend to rob you of your life.

250
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,697
My most gifted soldier
would likely have perished.

251
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,158
Well, I guess Lady Luck's
just on my side.

252
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,744
Blasphemy!
Your life is whole...

253
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,997
because the prophecy
decrees it to be such.

254
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,333
I'm sick of everybody riffing
about that prophecy...

255
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,377
about fate, destiny.

256
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,588
You can take that prophecy
and shove it up your ass!

257
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,761
Never have I been spoken to
in such a manner.

258
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:47,313
I find your insolence
oddly refreshing, Granger.

259
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,234
Our finest wine! My lord!

260
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,612
We have much to discuss, Granger.

261
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,409
You're not gonna rethink
the wine and have me...

262
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,786
dragged around by horses, are you?

263
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,708
Were you in contempt, Granger.

264
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,543
Were you in contempt.

265
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,382
Our finest grape.

266
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,722
Away.

267
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,231
The throne became mine
after a period of war.

268
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:35,403
Even from the Time Beyond you must
understand that after chaos comes stability.

269
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,781
And after stability follows chaos.

270
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,450
Yes.

271
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:44,454
Even as men of God, we are unable
to cease killing ourselves.

272
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,497
Our previous king,

273
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,292
a commoner who rose to the
throne, was a great man.

274
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,919
The people sang his praise,

275
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:56,174
and the kingdom knew
only prosperity in his time.

276
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,884
He was loved by all.

277
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,762
Until?

278
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,389
Until the Dark Ones rose.

279
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:07,602
The king and his followers
fought valiantly but succumbed.

280
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,021
It was only by divine will
that we managed...

281
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,899
to drive them from
our gates and survive.

282
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,861
Well, not to be overly
critical, but your, uh...

283
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,656
fortress is somewhat rustic.

284
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:25,328
We retreated to this
fortress out of desperation.

285
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,873
The Dark Ones carried
a plague in their blood,

286
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,250
and our walls were breached.

287
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,087
Well, who are the Dark Ones exactly?

288
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,255
Their origins are unknown.

289
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,051
They live in the mountains and
follow the word of their prophet.

290
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,178
The Holy Mother.

291
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,555
Yes.

292
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,227
They follow her word with a
reverence of that of a god.

293
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,479
Well, who is she, then?

294
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,150
Some say that she is a sorceress
of the black arts.

295
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,654
That her followers spill
their blood on her command.

296
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,949
And others say she demands
of her legions...

297
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,700
to eat one another.

298
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,787
Cannibalism?

299
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,956
I do not know this word.

300
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,625
It's to eat human flesh.

301
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,710
Yes.

302
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:18,005
Yes, to partake in that
would be unholy.

303
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:23,302
The meat of a human has become
intoxicating for these savages,

304
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,888
and it is now their way.

305
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,307
There's something wrong about this.

306
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,479
What about me?

307
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,106
Why do I matter to them?

308
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,442
And why have they targeted
your kingdom?

309
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:41,487
Because, Granger, we are
simply in their midst.

310
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,950
And you matter because
you are the Chosen One.

311
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,870
"Chosen"? What does that mean?
Chosen to do what?

312
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,206
Chosen to kill their Holy Mother.

313
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,672
Well, maybe this is just
mental exhaustion talking,

314
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,468
or maybe I'm just sick of people
chasing me down trying to kill me,

315
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,052
but...

316
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,557
tell me where to find
this crazy bitch.

317
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,145
Yes.

318
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,210
Chickens, my lord.

319
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,925
Fantastic.

320
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,945
The king!

321
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,572
On your feet.

322
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,616
I know. I know.

323
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,289
You shall feast like a king...

324
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,750
and fight like the God of War himself.

325
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,629
Pray you will remember which cloak
falls first upon your shoulders.

326
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,343
I appreciate this effort, but
I- I don't need all this stuff.

327
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,471
I only need my knife.
You will lower your blade.

328
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,557
I'm just making-
Lower your blade.

329
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,476
I'm making a point here.
I don't need an arsenal.

330
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,228
I move much quicker with my knife.

331
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,647
And if you want me to get
into this Holy Mother's camp,

332
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,857
it sure as hell won't be with a bag of chickens.

333
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,528
Haven't you people
ever heard of salmonella?

334
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,781
You have no need to carry additional
weapons or food supplies.

335
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,117
Exactly my point.

336
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,494
Allard and his men shall carry them.

337
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,205
Our doctor shall accompany
you and tend to your wounds.

338
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,292
You shall not be alone
in your quest, dear Granger.

339
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,168
That's what I was afraid of.

340
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,840
Sons of whores.

341
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,183
I'm unarmed. Stand down.

342
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,686
I have no personal quarrel with you.

343
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,896
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Would you mind?

344
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,861
May I?

345
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,363
Thank you very much.

346
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,576
I have acted hastily.
I shall take my leave.

347
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,124
Just for the record, I don't want you
to come tomorrow any more than you do.

348
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:46,297
It is the king's wish that I secure your
health on this quest, and it shall be done.

349
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,883
Well, lets face it.
It's not like you have a trauma team...

350
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,552
to stand by to stitch an arm back on.

351
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:55,139
In the Time Beyond, you
can re-affix a man's arm?

352
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,974
If the conditions are right.

353
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,269
This information pleases me.

354
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:04,023
You must tell me more tales about
your practices from the Time Beyond.

355
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,735
We'll speak... at night
while we make camp.

356
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,570
So you're coming?

357
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,530
Even though you don't want to.

358
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,909
The king has decreed it,
and it shall be done.

359
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,411
But you're not happy about it.

360
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,038
No!

361
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,999
Not in the slightest am I content
with my lot in this cursed life!

362
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,502
I will take my leave.

363
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,972
Very smooth, my man.

364
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,855
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't...

365
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,860
If we shall perish anon,

366
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,321
I will not die unfulfilled.

367
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,867
Unfulfilled?

368
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,455
Oh, right.

369
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,360
Our coupling was imprudent.

370
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:36,073
I was... rash and only
desired to satisfy my urges.

371
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,366
Well, did you?

372
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:42,580
I pray you will
tell no one of our union.

373
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,541
I will take my leave.

374
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,252
No one.

375
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,296
I'll tell no one. No one will know.

376
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,299
Mom's gonna love you.

377
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,017
He and he alone.

378
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,312
Do not fail me, Thane.

379
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,910
Royal affairs.
You have been summoned.

380
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,496
Of course.

381
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,332
It's been, what, an hour?

382
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,546
I don't suppose you're gonna tell me
why he wants to see me this time.

383
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,174
It is not the king for whom
you have been summoned.

384
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,884
It is the Seer.

385
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,636
Oh, "the Seer."
Aye.

386
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,932
Should I ask?

387
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,859
It is the king's wish that you listen to the
Seer's words and form none of your own.

388
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,987
Why?

389
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,407
Best you leave the chicken-fingered
wretch to her games in her tree.

390
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,702
No questions? You will hear her
words and stay your tongue.

391
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,746
And if I don't?

392
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,958
Then I shall take your tongue.

393
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,338
Allard, do you date a lot?

394
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,966
I mean, do people actually
like hanging out with you?

395
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,676
I mean, female people.

396
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:24,390
Or are you into that whole, uh,
sword-and-sweaty-sandals thing?

397
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,767
And the Turkish bath?
Huh?

398
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,477
Nope.

399
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,729
Hey, come on, man.

400
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:34,066
That's not a judgment, man.
Whatever floats your boat.

401
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,651
Come on, let's go.

402
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,922
There is to be a fountain of
blood in your days ahead.

403
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,133
A fountain?

404
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,055
My words unsettle you...

405
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,474
you, who has watched legions die,

406
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,895
yet who is the warrior who has
succumbed to the deeds of his past.

407
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,022
To the days ahead, woman.

408
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,318
By Your Majesty's divine wish.

409
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,653
You must complete
the two remaining trials.

410
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,072
Two of the three. Yes.

411
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,369
The first trial you passed
through from the Time Beyond.

412
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:31,665
The second trial, you-
you must slay the Dark Mother.

413
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,834
The third trial,
you must find the Catalyst.

414
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,545
The Catalyst alone...

415
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,882
shall release your restraints
and guide you to your destiny.

416
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,427
Pray, do not look to
these men for your salvation,

417
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,388
for they are mere worms
in destiny's eyes,

418
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,892
mere fodder for the winged serpent
of fate, so shiny are they.

419
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,938
Worms to the slaughter, you shall
find your end upon the high rocks.

420
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,690
You are alone, Chosen One.

421
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,777
You are alone, and there is
much fear upon your path.

422
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,528
The light remains-
The light...

423
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,699
remains only for a time,
and then you shall never be free.

424
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,452
You must cast the fear out of
your heart, or you shall fail.

425
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,536
Enough!

426
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,622
It is your fear that weakens you.

427
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,667
It is your fear the loosens
your hold upon this world.

428
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,211
You must leap into the void
to be truly free.

429
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,046
Enough, witch.
Know your place.

430
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,343
Your fear will carry you
to the pits of hell!

431
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,368
The king!

432
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,713
Your king commends your bravery.

433
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,757
You shall be honored as heroes.

434
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,051
Yeah, well, I hope we don't
get eaten by cannibals.

435
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,096
She's worried too.

436
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,599
You have a strange way
about you, Granger.

437
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,935
My lord.

438
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:27,281
May the gods shine upon you
and bring you home victorious.

439
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,326
Over there.
Right here?

440
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,827
By the line.

441
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,797
You okay?
Yes.

442
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,590
All right.
Hide behind that tree.

443
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,498
Why don't you guys want to kill me?

444
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,459
Because you are he.
So I've been told.

445
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,963
I pass knowing that I was
bested by the Chosen One.

446
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,715
I die a valiant death.

447
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,301
Talk to me.
Tell me what's going on.

448
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,470
Only the Holy Mother...

449
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,723
Only the Holy Mother...

450
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,060
You maniac!

451
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,478
Desist!

452
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,480
In the king's decree, desist.

453
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:09,151
This idiot just stabbed the best
way of getting into their camp!

454
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,694
Yeah, I'm talking to you, moron!

455
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,655
I follow the word of my king.
My king's word is law.

456
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,199
Desist!

457
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,743
We have wounded!
There are wounded!

458
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,333
I've worked with crazy
bastards like this before.

459
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,210
This is not gonna
end well for anybody.

460
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,463
He follows the word of our king.
Leave no Dark One alive.

461
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:35,260
To get in and out of the Holy Mother's
camp alive, we need information.

462
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,095
Harbor no mistruths, Granger.

463
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,431
We may reach
the Holy Mother's sanctum,

464
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,017
but the path shall be
drenched with our blood.

465
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,687
I'll keep that in mind.

466
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,929
If it is to be,

467
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,348
it is to be.

468
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,677
That's an impressive field dressing.

469
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,972
It's not my first.

470
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,224
Yeah.

471
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,479
In the Time Beyond,

472
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,357
would you have the knowledge
to save this man from his wound?

473
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,569
Probably.

474
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,904
Maybe.

475
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,073
Who's to say?

476
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,745
He will die, that soldier.

477
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,556
Your words...

478
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,600
"He must be calm."

479
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,357
Yeah, look- My anger has
left me since our fight.

480
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,609
I acted in haste.

481
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,862
Look, I grabbed you first.

482
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,782
I am my king's servant.

483
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,785
Pray, you forgive my actions.

484
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,121
No problem.

485
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,665
Listen.

486
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,376
They brought 18 men.

487
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,669
Seventeen under our boots, one fled.

488
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,715
Now, we're also 18, including
you, me and the doc.

489
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,425
Does that seem strange to you?

490
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,345
That they exactly
matched us in numbers?

491
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,641
They followed us to this point.

492
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,268
Or we have a spy.

493
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,561
Aye.

494
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,064
But why would they not dispatch
a legion to best us?

495
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,316
Why did they only match us to the man?

496
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,654
I think that 50 Dark Ones
raining down on our heads...

497
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,365
would increase the odds
of all of us getting killed,

498
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,367
intentionally or by accident.

499
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,412
Their attack, no matter how crude,
was with bloody intent.

500
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,996
For some of us.

501
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,833
Now, one of them had a chance
to kill me but didn't.

502
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:57,170
He was confused, like he wanted
to stab me, but he didn't.

503
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,590
I think the Holy Mother wants me alive.

504
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,176
For what purpose?
You are her death.

505
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,180
Perhaps there's more to this
than we understand.

506
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,349
Perhaps.

507
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,230
For now, we need to make ourselves
less conspicuous.

508
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:18,859
We must dispatch to higher ground.

509
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,695
It is certain.

510
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,880
I have told no one of your plans.

511
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,841
I have uttered not a word.

512
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,405
I'm done with it.

513
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,330
There's some weather moving in.

514
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,332
Weather is of no concern.

515
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,718
A bit tougher going
without the horses.

516
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,811
You don't like starting
conversations, do you?

517
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,440
It's not my place.

518
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,449
In the Time Beyond, are the
expectations of women alike?

519
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,037
No. Yes, no...

520
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,082
lt's complicated.

521
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,962
Could you tell me about the medicine
from the Time Beyond?

522
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,381
Sure.

523
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:07,467
Well, we have
something called antibiotics.

524
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:10,428
Anti-biotics.

525
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:14,015
"Antibiotics."

526
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,017
Like a potion.

527
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,228
Of sorts.

528
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,980
You inject it or you swallow it,

529
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,607
usually, and...

530
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,693
from what are they made?

531
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:28,572
I think it's made from moldy cheese.

532
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,032
Cheese?

533
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,577
Yeah. You know?

534
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,287
You know that green stuff?

535
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,205
The guy who discovered it,
he realized...

536
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,292
that the moldy cheese
killed the bacteria.

537
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,836
Mold. That's all I
remember from Biology.

538
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,714
I had too much fun in high school.

539
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,257
I guess I was just, ...

540
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,050
Mold.
I guess to you, uh,

541
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,677
high school was just...

542
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,305
was just a school high on a hill.

543
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,435
Cheese.

544
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,812
Mold.
Yep.

545
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,689
Cheese mold.

546
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,736
Sleep tight, Doc.

547
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,915
Weapons!

548
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,876
- Move!
- Come on, let's go!

549
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,379
Move!

550
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:31,259
Go, go, go!

551
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,345
Go, go, go! Now!

552
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,403
Take cover!

553
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,748
Guess they don't want me alive.

554
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,918
They changed their strategy
after our previous victory.

555
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,212
We have to go over and down.
It's our only chance.

556
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,382
There's too many to fight.

557
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,676
There's no time
for all of us to descend.

558
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,136
They shall rain fire on us
before we reach the bottom.

559
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,514
That's a chance we have to take.

560
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,474
That chance is yours and yours alone.

561
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,351
You will take the woman and flee.

562
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,852
We will defend this ridge
with our lives.

563
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,605
No way.
I'm not leaving you here.

564
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,358
If I believe that you ar
truly the Chosen One,

565
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,984
then you must not perish!

566
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,987
Go now. Complete the journey,
fulfill the prophecy.

567
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,948
Are you deaf?

568
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,909
I'm not leaving you here.

569
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,209
I shall never forget you,
Granger from a Time Beyond.

570
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,586
I trust you shall do me the same honor.

571
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,296
I must follow him.

572
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,305
My loyal soldiers,

573
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,392
it has been an honor to have led you.

574
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,728
To the other side,

575
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,980
through a shower of their blood!

576
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,481
Coward.

577
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,029
Elianna.

578
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,219
You okay?

579
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,262
I'm thoroughly bruised.

580
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,018
Let's go.

581
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,233
They have passed from this world.

582
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,738
Good-bye, soldier.

583
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,283
Come on.

584
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:45,411
Allard saved our lives that morning.

585
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,996
Let's face it:

586
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,500
he probably saved the
world as we know it.

587
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,377
Come on. Let's go.

588
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,132
The poor wretch.

589
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,301
When was this heinous act committed?

590
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,595
Perhaps two hours ago, my lord.

591
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,849
The witch was held fast
without guards.

592
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,560
What kind of a man enacts
such brutality on a woman?

593
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,937
What kind of a creature does this?

594
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,983
Search the fortress.

595
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:18,778
Comb the grounds.
Bring the perpetrator to me by nightfall.

596
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:25,577
Mark me, a dark curtain
has fallen around our kingdom.

597
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,289
Honor thy seer, and bury her deep.

598
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,875
Yes, my lord.

599
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,895
Are there parts of your body
to which I must attend?

600
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:52,979
Sorry?

601
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,898
Injuries.

602
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,066
I got lucky.
We got lucky.

603
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,737
Perhaps the gods
have seen fit to grant us...

604
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,161
Why are you covering your face?

605
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,996
It is cracked.

606
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,922
The liquid, it is poison.

607
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,382
The water corrects its form
and renders it harmless.

608
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,967
Poison?

609
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,677
For the Holy Mother.

610
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,680
Or is there something else
I should know?

611
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,852
If we were taken, I was to drink.

612
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,729
You mean like cyanide?

613
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,272
It kills you instantly?

614
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,441
It instantly kills its bearer...

615
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,152
and eradicates all
who come in contact with him.

616
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:45,281
You mean like a going-away, "don't
get captured" present from the king?

617
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:46,741
The king is an alchemist.

618
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,953
He has helped many
with his skills since taking the craft.

619
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,621
You sure it's okay there in the creek,

620
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,541
or did we just send a "get stuffed"
message to the people downstream?

621
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:58,544
The water corrects its form.
It is harmless now.

622
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,966
It is a plague.
Oh, great.

623
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,969
I was wondering who was
carrying our biological weapons.

624
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,896
We must reach the Dark
Mother's cabin by nightfall.

625
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,942
You're not going anywhere, Doc.

626
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,070
My flesh is bruised,
but my bones are intact.

627
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,155
You're not going anywhere.

628
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,074
Do not trifle with me.

629
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,868
I will accompany you
to the Mother's camp.

630
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,788
Not on this foot, Doc,
and you know it.

631
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,623
Sons of whores.

632
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,166
I have failed you.

633
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,836
This spot is secluded enough.

634
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,963
Got the woods behind you.
You got a fresh water supply.

635
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,842
- You'll be safe here. Do you have a weapon?
- Aye.

636
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:49,595
All right, if I'm not back within two days,
go back to the fortress.

637
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,766
And while you're here,
stab anyone who isn't me.

638
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,811
Wait!

639
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,273
If you believe what I do,

640
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,819
it is a protective talisman,
perhaps more.

641
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,613
If you don't believe what I do,

642
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,118
it is still something beautiful
at which to look.

643
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,168
Just keep yourself safe.

644
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,059
Reconnaissance...

645
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,979
terrestrial foreplay
to successful ground warfare.

646
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,731
Get in, get your information...

647
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,734
and get the hell out
with your scalp intact.

648
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,657
Dark Ones.

649
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,827
Stay down.

650
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:32,365
By the gods, I'm no cook.

651
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,451
Leave me alone and I'll poison myself.

652
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,218
Undercooked.

653
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:01,727
My lord.

654
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:04,647
- Speak.
- No news from the search.

655
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,482
The villain eludes our men...

656
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,777
for now.
As they are meant to do.

657
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,530
In your time you will learn
that villains often hide...

658
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,574
in plain sight.

659
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,451
Now leave me, soldier.

660
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:21,414
My thoughts are troubled
and require my utmost attention.

661
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,083
My lord.

662
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:30,131
I need to believe that you
are capable, Chosen One.

663
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,698
She's in there.

664
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,783
No guards, no armaments.

665
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:01,078
Something isn't right,
but she's in there.

666
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,539
I can feel she's in there.

667
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:06,584
Do this thing or let it pass.

668
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,464
He's here.

669
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,884
Watch him.

670
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,743
I have been waiting for you.

671
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:53,839
I have waited a lifetime
to once more set eyes upon you.

672
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,675
Have we met before?

673
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:59,720
Sorry. I'm not
that good with faces.

674
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:00,805
Go.

675
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:09,021
Many nights have I dreamed
of this moment.

676
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:12,942
You are not a man
who has found peace in his dreams.

677
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:22,368
My agility is not
what it once had been.

678
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:26,789
I'm afraid this withered shell has
betrayed my purest intention.

679
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:33,129
It was my hope to bring you
back to our time myself.

680
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,475
It was you.

681
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,603
The warning came in my dreams.

682
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:53,024
Visions of the attempt
on your life in the Time Beyond.

683
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,820
I myself ventured to your world...

684
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:01,282
to ensure that your life
was not taken...

685
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,076
before you could come back to us.

686
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,751
Alas, your weapon was formidable.

687
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,091
The King Before liberated our lands...

688
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,386
from an evil usurper
bent on domination.

689
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:27,391
We pushed through great darkness
to find peace, however fleeting.

690
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:30,644
- Raven.
- 'Twas barely a man.

691
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:34,857
The cursed snake
poxed the king's troops.

692
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,609
He released a plague...

693
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,570
which ran unrestrained
through the kingdom,

694
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,907
killing most with agonizing cruelty.

695
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,534
Its rein slipped
through his fingers...

696
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,578
the moment he gave it life.

697
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,663
The alchemist.

698
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,710
The King Before, his family,

699
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,921
all were lost.

700
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:59,799
Heroic to the end, were they.

701
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,343
Then Raven took the throne.

702
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:06,013
Coup d'etat using biological weapons.

703
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:09,266
The loyal were driven
to the mountains.

704
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,938
We fled with the clothes
on our backs...

705
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,773
and the sickness in our blood.

706
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:21,112
How many rotted
before its tide, I cannot say.

707
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:25,783
We believe Raven secrets the remedy...

708
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,868
inside the fortress walls.

709
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,790
Then what have I got to do
with all this?

710
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,584
When the castle
looked to fall to Raven,

711
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,755
your father entrusted me
to save your life.

712
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,173
My father?

713
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:45,094
You are the King Before's lost son.

714
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,972
You are our king.

715
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,811
We traveled to your time...

716
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,021
to the Time Beyond...

717
01:02:56,106 --> 01:03:00,401
where I hid you in a place
that welcomes lost children.

718
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,570
The orphanage.

719
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,156
And there you remained.

720
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:10,411
Then why send men to kill me?

721
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,538
Why did you send your men?

722
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:18,627
I tasked one man to
bring you back to me.

723
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:23,924
The others, the Dark Ones who
traveled with him through the gate,

724
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,594
were under his command.

725
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,223
He twisted my words...

726
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,934
for his own cause.

727
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:37,605
It appears we have a
traitor in our midst.

728
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:41,275
Thane abandoned our cause...

729
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,319
for his own vengeful blood-lust.

730
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,280
And this is how you seek
to avenge our fallen?

731
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:50,784
By making peace
with the tyrant that cast us out?

732
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:51,827
Never!

733
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:54,079
Mark my words, old woman.

734
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,958
We shall have our vengeance.

735
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:03,756
I have seen your
passing, and it is near.

736
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:10,471
You presume to weave the
truth, to shift my resolve.

737
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,850
As it is seen, so it shall pass.

738
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,186
To the gods I swear
your death shall be quick.

739
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,745
Raven...

740
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:38,874
butchered his family
before his very eyes.

741
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:41,669
We must not cast stones.

742
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,383
My lord, don't.

743
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,301
Don't, please.

744
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,972
God.

745
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,683
God has left this place.

746
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:05,025
A fortnight
after the king's sorcerer...

747
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,278
brings you back to our time,

748
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,239
your Time Beyond is no more.

749
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,993
A carrier travels
back to your world...

750
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,662
and releases the plague.

751
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,790
Raven's alchemy.

752
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:25,004
The lethal snake crawls
across your world without mercy.

753
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:27,214
A fortnight,

754
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,175
and all are lost in the Time Beyond.

755
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,849
My lord.

756
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,184
What say you?

757
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:42,229
Our spies tell us the Chosen One has
entered the Dark Mother's camp.

758
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,108
And any word of his plight?

759
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,693
He is alive.

760
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,242
She has him and he lives?

761
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:58,871
Aye. The Dark Mother lives,
as does the Chosen One.

762
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,457
How does this come to pass?

763
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,209
It is the blackest of sorcery!

764
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,004
He was supposed to slay
the witch in her bed!

765
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,175
Ready my horse,
and alert the royal guard.

766
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,509
My lord.

767
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:15,262
We shall flush out this
traitorous wretch from beyond.

768
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:27,566
I shall flush you out.

769
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,083
I have moments left in this life.

770
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,252
Is there a way to get back
to the Time Beyond?

771
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,088
I have medicine that could save you.

772
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,465
I am too weak,

773
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:55,552
and it is fate that I pass over
from my own time.

774
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:58,180
You keep talking
about destiny, about fate.

775
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,682
I don't believe in it.

776
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,976
I believe we make our own
destiny, follow our own plans.

777
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:06,146
Aye, I could see it no other way.

778
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:09,149
Then why do you keep talking about
destiny deciding this or that?

779
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:14,947
I have dreamt of the
passing of your world,

780
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:18,826
of the blackened corpses
lining your streets,

781
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:23,914
but I know not of how the
sickness came to find your time.

782
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,542
And in this uncertainty lies hope,

783
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:32,798
in this not knowing hides the
dragon that shall slay the tyrant.

784
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,804
You believe I can change my future?

785
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:43,267
I believe you shall change
all our futures.

786
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:51,024
I never asked you, why
do they cover their faces?

787
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,444
To honor the dead...

788
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,154
who have been taken
from us by the plague.

789
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,285
- Look, I have to get you back to your hut.
- No.

790
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,911
You're too sick.
No.

791
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,788
Soon I shall pass,

792
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,542
and until the moment...

793
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,670
that you return to the Time Beyond,

794
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,089
you are their king.

795
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:16,925
Lead them with your heart.

796
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,512
I hope your dreams bring
you peace, Holy Mother.

797
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,056
Safe home.

798
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,069
I am Dunyana, my lord.

799
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:42,910
What are you going to do with her?

800
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:45,913
We shall prepare her
for the honorable passage.

801
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:55,255
Our road becomes more
treacherous with her passing.

802
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,224
You shall enter the Black Forest
and retrieve the Catalyst.

803
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,435
Which is what?
I know not of its form.

804
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,938
Then how am I supposed to find it?

805
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,482
It is said the Chosen One
shall seek the Catalyst.

806
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,860
So it is written, so it
shall- lt shall pass.

807
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,653
Yeah, I know.
I understand.

808
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,697
But we just go
with the flow around here...

809
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,282
and hope not to get screwed, right?

810
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,284
Screwed?
Yeah.

811
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,661
You know, compromised,
left vulnerable.

812
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,205
Your words, yeah, I know.

813
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,499
It is literally black.

814
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:15,752
Thought that was just some medieval...
gloom and doom.

815
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:17,337
Pray you heed my words.

816
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:20,299
No man has entered the Black
Forest and lived to tell the tale.

817
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,926
There are dark forces at work
within its woods.

818
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:26,597
Some say sorcery, others speak
knowingly of enchanted beasts.

819
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,432
With the Holy Mother's passing,

820
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,184
our connection to the beasts
within is severed.

821
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:34,146
They roam freely without
her spells of containment.

822
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,148
I cannot speak to your safety.

823
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:39,276
Wonderfully cryptic.

824
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,070
We shall accompany you
to its edge and no further.

825
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:44,031
Thus it has been decreed
by the Holy Mother.

826
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,868
My lord.

827
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,245
Can't tell me anything
about this Catalyst?

828
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,372
I'm going in with zero intel?

829
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:54,374
My lord, I know not of its origins.

830
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:58,253
It is said the Catalyst shall bring peace
to our world, yet we know not how.

831
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,340
I've heard many stories how to
bring peace to a place in my time,

832
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,800
but your prophecy
is refreshingly vague.

833
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,636
Let's see what we can find in there.

834
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:09,056
Come on!

835
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,416
My lord.

836
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,961
What news have you?

837
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,463
The Holy Mother has passed.

838
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,173
And the Chosen One?

839
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:46,510
They accompany him
to the Black Forest.

840
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,012
For what purpose?

841
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:50,555
It...

842
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,727
is the location of the Catalyst.

843
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,564
So the prophecy rings true.

844
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:02,401
The gods themselves
conspire to make it so.

845
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,946
I shall rule the kingdom united.

846
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,365
You are excused.

847
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,077
My servant.

848
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,422
Your loyalty will be remembered.

849
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:36,476
Food for the hours within.

850
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,895
Thanks.

851
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,023
So I guess this is it.

852
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,442
Aye. We are at the impasse.

853
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:47,446
Follow the signs and the Catalyst
shall reveal itself to you.

854
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,865
Our people are watched from within...

855
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,200
Spies who pledge their
allegiance to the tyrant.

856
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:56,204
Raven.
Aye, the serpent himself.

857
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,749
Pray you, if you should cross
paths once again,

858
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:02,210
that you strike at him mercilessly
so that he is screwed.

859
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,797
Have I offended you, my lord?

860
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,382
No.

861
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:09,051
It's just...

862
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,178
you remind me of her.

863
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,972
You speak of the Holy Mother?
Yes.

864
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,516
I see now...

865
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,229
that you're her daughter.

866
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,939
It was my honor.

867
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,941
And when this is over,

868
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,526
when I've returned
with the Catalyst...

869
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,362
and Raven is screwed,

870
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,574
who takes over the kingdom?

871
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,327
My lord?
The throne.

872
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,872
Who sits on the throne if I manage
to return to the Time Beyond?

873
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:42,042
As King without son,
you select your rightful heir, my lord.

874
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,044
It is our custom.

875
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:46,713
And your people will return
to the fortress?

876
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:50,008
We shall await the Catalyst to show us
the way through their fortifications.

877
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,428
Then what?

878
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:55,889
Our people have been
on the outside for far too long.

879
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,476
We shall secure the antidote
to our sickness.

880
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,729
If we are able to heal our numbers,
to unite our people once again,

881
01:14:02,814 --> 01:14:06,691
it is my dream that a peace
shall become true.

882
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,152
Peace?

883
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:11,404
Aye. It is all that matters.

884
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,164
You should be a righteous queen.

885
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:23,625
No, my lord,
I cannot accept this honor.

886
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,961
You can and you will.
I've decreed it.

887
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,796
Hey, listen, guys.

888
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,048
I've decreed it. My lord.

889
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:35,971
My lord, perhaps you'd
prefer a larger blade.

890
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,515
I have a feeling in the Black Forest,

891
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,600
size does matter.

892
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:43,436
It is forbidden to
touch a king, but I...

893
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,492
Your mother advised me
to rule with my heart,

894
01:14:57,577 --> 01:15:00,245
but I'm not much of a poet,

895
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,082
so I can only offer you her words.

896
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,546
Oh, my God,
I'm starting to talk like you.

897
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,603
Godspeed, my lord.

898
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,287
I can't believe this medieval crap.

899
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,602
Pull forward!

900
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,314
Is he in there?

901
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,360
Halt!

902
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:22,494
Enter these woods
and bring me the Chosen One.

903
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,496
The woods are haunted, my lord.

904
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,249
Not man nor beast
have escaped its clutches.

905
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,377
My king.

906
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,425
Would your insolence betray
the peace of our kingdom?

907
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,928
No, my lord.

908
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,846
Then enter these woods...

909
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:46,059
and show the demons that you
are soldiers of the realm!

910
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,769
Retrieve the Chosen One,

911
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,647
and bring the Catalyst to me!

912
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:53,066
My lord!

913
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,694
My 10 best, follow me!

914
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,445
Move!
Yes, my lord!

915
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,948
Forward!
For the king!

916
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,201
For King and country.

917
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,289
Move!

918
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:13,003
Come here, lads!
All right.

919
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,297
Keep your mind fixed on the goal.

920
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:17,841
Find the Catalyst and get
your ass out of there...

921
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,385
before something eats you.

922
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,030
Doubt a grizzly could do that.

923
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,550
I suddenly wish you were a grizzly.

924
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:13,480
Easy, boy.

925
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,444
Here!

926
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,864
- Manhattan?
- Run!

927
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,262
Nice to see you.
How you been?

928
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:48,056
Never thought
I'd be chased by a dragon.

929
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,058
You have aligned yourself
with the Dark Mother!

930
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,851
Change of strategy.

931
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:53,728
I am confused by your betrayal.

932
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:56,314
Well, we're on a bit of a
schedule, so I'll keep it brief.

933
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,692
My king.
Yes.

934
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,195
It seems like he's responsible
for spreading a plague,

935
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,531
orchestrating a coup
against the King Before.

936
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:08,618
Now I have to find the Catalyst and
save this world and the Time Beyond...

937
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,912
because I'm the King Before's son.

938
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,455
This cannot be.

939
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,375
Yeah, what the hell?
Exactly, am I right?

940
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,545
Son of a bitch. We're still being
chased by a dragon. Let's go.

941
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,841
By the way, the Holy Mother's dead.
What?

942
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,358
Whatever you think you're here to do,

943
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,777
we all better
get the hell out of here.

944
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:45,405
We are the guardians of the realm.

945
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,282
We stand aside not for man,

946
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,033
nor for beast!

947
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,493
Good luck with that, Custer.

948
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,912
For king! For country!

949
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:56,833
Aaah!

950
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,178
No!

951
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,737
The end of the devilish woods.

952
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,490
I can't go with you.

953
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,366
I haven't recovered the Catalyst.

954
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:32,952
We shall return anon.
Up there only death awaits.

955
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,122
I have to go.
Do you not value your life?

956
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:37,916
To ascend is madness!

957
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,668
I'll circle around and
avoid the big nasty.

958
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,049
Surround them!

959
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:47,717
We're screwed, aren't we?

960
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:49,594
Watch her.

961
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,222
Yeah, don't let her run.

962
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:54,641
We're screwed.

963
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:58,478
I'll take four of you pussies
with me, and you know it.

964
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,523
To resist now
would be pure folly, Granger.

965
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:06,861
You were the one that brought
the plague upon our houses.

966
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:08,279
You!

967
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,949
Curb your tongue, Doctor.

968
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:12,951
I am still your king.

969
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:17,038
You are the true villain of this tale.

970
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:23,461
Well, Granger from the Time Beyond,

971
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:25,463
before nightfall...

972
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:29,926
your entrails will be hanging
from the fortress gate.

973
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:36,266
Bring them both.

974
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,351
Yes, sir.

975
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,186
Pick him up.

976
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:54,409
Welcome to your final moments
in this world, wretch.

977
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,995
The devil himself awaits your passing.

978
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,166
Blasphemy, you cursed witch!

979
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,796
This man is your rightful king...

980
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,590
the King Before's son.

981
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,216
On the life of my mother!

982
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:12,302
Lies!

983
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:15,638
You are the black-tongued
agent of the Dark Mother.

984
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:17,807
Take them from their steed.

985
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:20,226
I shall end their life
where they stand!

986
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:25,481
This one. Come on.
Bring them here.

987
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:29,944
I shall cut your guts out myself.

988
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,029
No!

989
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:37,785
- Stop him!
- Strike him!

990
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,705
Grab him!
He is your rightful King!

991
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:45,668
This looks bad.

992
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,630
It was an honor to fight by your side
and mate with you as your woman.

993
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,674
Run! Shit.

994
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:53,259
Incoming.

995
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,847
Run!

996
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,016
Raven is making way to the portal...

997
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,643
The portal to your world.

998
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:21,454
The gate! The gate!

999
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,922
Quick! Lock it!

1000
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:32,799
Look out!

1001
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:54,320
Our sister has brought down their walls.

1002
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,447
The dragon is the Catalyst...

1003
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,199
The Catalyst!

1004
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,159
We hold.

1005
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,044
Our time.

1006
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,338
Our time!

1007
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:20,531
Surprise attack!

1008
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:23,993
Look out!

1009
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,720
For the Holy Mother.

1010
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:01,989
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1011
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:12,416
He secrets two vials on
his person at all times.

1012
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,544
Two. Go!

1013
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,100
My actions are either that of a fool...

1014
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,893
or a conqueror.

1015
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,402
Go!

1016
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,493
Only you can save your world!

1017
01:26:48,996 --> 01:26:51,163
And I shall save mine.

1018
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:53,791
We may see each other again.

1019
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:36,876
Aaah!

1020
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:57,605
I could have brought peace to my time.

1021
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,190
Peace!

1022
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,508
I am your king!

1023
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,900
You were never king.

1024
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:57,957
History's full of losers like you.

1025
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:21,063
We did it.

1026
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,697
Will I ever see you again?

1027
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,161
What is it you said?

1028
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:39,331
Perhaps in my dreams tonight.

1029
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,584
Perhaps another time.

1030
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,963
Perhaps another time.
