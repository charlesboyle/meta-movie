1
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:20,123
Who's he?

2
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:26,422
Wait at the bar.
This is no way to greet an old friend.

3
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:29,097
You kept me waiting here for 2 weeks.

4
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:34,680
Right! It's Paris. See the sights.

5
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,817
I'm here for work.

6
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:43,213
There's a lot of ground to cover.
Difficult terrain. Remote.

7
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:46,656
They want me to send someone with you.

8
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:52,489
Two men is a security risk.

9
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:58,417
This is an important job.
There's no room for mistakes.

10
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:01,763
So don't make any.

11
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:06,968
It must be very nice for you.
Not to need anyone.

12
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,214
<i>The client is Red Leaf.
A military biotech.</i>

13
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:18,581
<i>They're after something
extremely rare.</i>

14
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:21,852
<i>You're to bring back
biological samples.</i>

15
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:25,869
<i>Blood, skin, hair, organs.</i>

16
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:32,363
<i>As for the rest, make sure no
one else can ever find it.</i>

17
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:40,480
<i>What Red Leaf wants
is very valuable.</i>

18
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,352
Tasmanian Tiger.

19
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:45,860
<i>But only if they have
exclusive ownership.</i>

20
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,394
<i>You are looking for something
most believe is extinct.</i>

21
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,973
<i>The rarest, most elusive
creature on the planet.</i>

22
00:02:57,683 --> 00:03:01,578
<i>The client has evidence
it still exists.</i>

23
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:05,941
<i>If so, it may be the very last one.</i>

24
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:53,659
THE HUNTER

25
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:28,007
<i>The client has reports
from a reliable source.</i>

26
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,225
<i>Two confirmed sightings
in the past year.</i>

27
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:38,056
<i>Until now, these sightings
have been kept secret...</i>

28
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:40,283
<i>...but word always gets out.</i>

29
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:47,775
<i>We have only a couple of
months, maybe less.</i>

30
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:53,991
<i>After that there will be competition.</i>

31
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,749
Perhaps there already is.

32
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,158
Hello?

33
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:59,430
<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

34
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,294
You can't wake her up.

35
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,136
I'm Martin David, from the University.

36
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:08,855
Hello, Martin David. My name's
Sass. This is my brother Bike.

37
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,214
Mom said we should take
you to see your room.

38
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:13,324
Come on.

39
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:26,402
- Bulb's burned out.
- Nah... No fucking power.

40
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:31,442
- Excuse me?
- It's the generator. Stopped working.

41
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,038
You gonna fix it?

42
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:41,877
I got a lot of equipment.
I need power.

43
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,907
Yeh. Used to work, but it stopped.

44
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:48,029
Dad says the fucken
fucker's completely fucked.

45
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:02,958
- Where's your father?
- Gone away. Up there.

46
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:08,242
He'll be back soon though.
He'll fix it if you can't.

47
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,835
There's water in the cold tap.

48
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:24,453
Oh, and the toilet's outside.

49
00:07:55,632 --> 00:08:00,917
- You right there mate?
- Ah, just need to use the restroom.

50
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,768
You wanna drink first?

51
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:07,493
Right.

52
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:12,226
- Beer?
- Sure.

53
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:24,963
SAVE OUR NATIVE FORESTS
( -- JOBS -- )

54
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:36,093
- How much to rent a room?
- No vacancies.

55
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,176
- Not even one small room?
- All regulars, mate .. Live-ins.

56
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:43,058
I can pay double.

57
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:46,371
Pay triple if you want.
Same difference.

58
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:50,222
Hey, you!...
Hey, you!

59
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:54,631
- You wanna room?
- Yeah.

60
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:58,535
Yeah.
Well, you can't have one.

61
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:08,731
- You're from overseas, aren't you? Some Uni?
- You got a room? I can pay.

62
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:12,251
Nuh. The thing is... mate,

63
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:15,310
We don't really like greenies around here.

64
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:21,215
So, unless you want to join your mate,
Jarrah fucking Armstrong...

65
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,719
...fuck off.

66
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:29,409
- You're up Dougie.
- Coming.

67
00:09:55,619 --> 00:10:00,086
I've arrived. The lodging
is... not what I excepted.

68
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:01,958
The communication may be a problem.

69
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:05,682
So, I'll call when I have
something to report.

70
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,020
What's she singing about?

71
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:08,876
She sounds sad. Yelling like that.

72
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:13,832
She's not yelling.
Don't you ever listen to music?

73
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,275
Sure. My Dad likes "The Boss".

74
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:18,208
Who?

75
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,027
"The Boss". Bruce Springsteen. He rocks.

76
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:22,408
Shouldn't come in here without knocking.

77
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:27,105
You're looking for my dad?

78
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:31,869
No, I'm researching Tasmanian devils.

79
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,825
But if you see him, you'll
tell him to come home?

80
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:41,897
I'll be up for twelve days, then I'll come back
for two days to resupply and do my paperwork.

81
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:46,064
If I'm not back,
Wednesday next week...

82
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:50,315
Take this, when you go up.

83
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,615
You can keep it for while.

84
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:58,388
Here's my Dad. We gave him that for
his birthday. It's what he looks like.

85
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:05,900
Okay.

86
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,974
44.30...

87
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:13,868
Those are my coordinates. They're
points on the map. Now, listen.

88
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:18,219
- When your mother wakes up...
- I know. Twelve days.

89
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,806
Jack's here!

90
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:25,726
- Where are my soldiers?
- Jack!

91
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:30,460
Hey, little princess. Hi, mate.

92
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:33,763
There he is.

93
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:40,104
- G'day, Jack Mindy.
- Martin David. How's it going?

94
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:42,186
- How's the room, alright?
- Yeah, it's fine, thanks.

95
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,913
Any problems, just let me know,
I'll sort it out.

96
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:51,649
It's a good spot for you here.
Quiet, convenient.

97
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:55,707
Now, the blokes from the university
told me you needed a guide.

98
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,671
- Really?
- Yeah. I can take can take you up there...

99
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,967
- No, no, I, I don't...
- No, no, no, it's not problem.

100
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:05,223
You can get your stuff and follow
me in your truck. Alright?

101
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:37,750
Who were they?

102
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:41,190
Blockade? It's Greenies
protesting the logging.

103
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:45,161
- Jarrah started all that.
- The children's father?

104
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:49,496
Jarrah, yeah. I've a lot of
time for Jarrah, he's a good bloke,

105
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,617
eco-warrior.

106
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,518
- Where is he now?
- He went missing last summer.

107
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,513
He was out doing his university
work, he never came back down.

108
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:06,505
- Didn't the university tell you?
- Different university.

109
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:11,430
Anyway. It was a bloody nightmare
Search & Rescue was out for two weeks...

110
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,344
...not a trace.

111
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:16,654
And his wife?

112
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:22,624
Lucy is not doing too good. She's
...um, I do what I can to help.

113
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:25,852
Your rent money will
go a long way.

114
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:35,721
This is all earmarked for logging.

115
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,129
- What is it you're studying?
- Devils.

116
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,889
Dunno why, they're pests.

117
00:16:46,926 --> 00:16:50,524
Still, makes a change.

118
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,695
From what?

119
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:57,613
We get a lot of tourists this way
looking for the Tassie tiger.

120
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,686
They think they can take
a bit of a day trip...

121
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:03,272
...and find an animal that's
been written off as extinct.

122
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:08,825
- What do you think?
- I heard one once.

123
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:14,293
I was a kid. I was up trapping with my dad.

124
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,944
50 years ago but I still remember it.

125
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,317
Every now and again some clown reckons
he sees one but...

126
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:24,174
...no one can ever prove it.

127
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,301
Not a Sunday stroll up where you
want to go Mr. David.

128
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:38,045
Part of it is highlands. Never been mapped.

129
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:43,538
There are satellite maps alright, but it
doesn't mean anyone's ever been there.

130
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:48,027
What do you think happened
to Jarrah Armstrong?

131
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:55,355
Slipped, fell, broke
a leg, froze, starved...

132
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,800
And then the devils got him.

133
00:17:57,837 --> 00:18:00,854
Eat you alive if you give 'em a chance.

134
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,252
Odd, though, not to find a trace.

135
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:07,760
Well, depends if anyone
wanted a trace left.

136
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:10,420
Made a few enemies, Jarrah.

137
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:13,264
He was a foreigner, like yourself.

138
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:16,085
Wanted to save the trees.

139
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,601
Logging trees is the only reason
there's any people here at all.

140
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:24,984
For a town. So you can imagine
when he arrived a few years back
he was as popular as...

141
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:27,886
...a snake in a sleeping bag.

142
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,538
- Good Lord!
- Good Lord indeed, Mr. David.

143
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,513
Thank you, Mr. Mindy.
I'll take it from here.

144
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,915
You what?

145
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:03,950
I'd like to go on alone.

146
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:09,329
- Are you sure? It's...
- Yes, I'm sure.

147
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:14,883
Well, suit yourself.

148
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,468
I'll leave you to it then.
See you in a couple of weeks.

149
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:24,302
And watch your step.

150
00:25:17,827 --> 00:25:22,528
<i>GO HOME GREENIE SCUM</i>

151
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:17,601
G'day.

152
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,853
You're back then.

153
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:26,019
- You get what you needed?
- Sort of.

154
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:31,596
- Seen many "devils"?
- Yes.

155
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,396
Sick or healthy?

156
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,984
Healthy.

157
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:44,769
Oh well, don't let me stand in your way.
Just brought 'round some supplies.

158
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:49,192
Your dinner's in the kitchen.

159
00:27:10,582 --> 00:27:16,460
- Is that your father?
- Which? Oh, yeah, he did it.

160
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,039
- Why is scratching his head?
- He's not.

161
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:26,167
He's looking for something. But
you'd never guess what for.

162
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:30,042
- A way out of here?
- A tiger.

163
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,884
Really? A tiger?

164
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:37,767
- What kind of tiger?
- A Tasmanian tiger.

165
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:40,032
A Tasmanian tiger?

166
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:45,395
- That's very interesting, but you
know, they don't exist. - Do so.

167
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:51,469
- They're extinct
- Are not! My dad saw one last summer. It's a secret.

168
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:57,097
He must have told somebody about it.
Somebody else besides you?

169
00:27:57,102 --> 00:28:02,053
- Have other people seen it?
- I do not know. Ask him.

170
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:15,764
Hello. I hear you're doing some
research on the plateau, "Devils", right?

171
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:20,088
- Yes, that's right.
- Very cool.

172
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:25,263
- I'm Free by the way. This is Simon.
- How's it going?

173
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:28,732
You should stop by some time.
We'd love to hear about your work.

174
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,834
I'm sorry, but I won't have any time.

175
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:34,221
You're not using traps up
there, are you? Steel traps?

176
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:36,633
No. I won't do that.

177
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,908
Thanks.

178
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:18,151
I bet you helped your dad too.

179
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:27,280
What is that? A monkey face?

180
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,003
OK. Here goes nothing.

181
00:33:54,961 --> 00:34:00,413
- Where did these come from?
- It's a prescription from a doctor.

182
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:03,666
Jack Mindy brings them.

183
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:09,967
Your mother doesn't need
these anymore. So, no more, OK?

184
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:11,869
OK.

185
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:17,550
Go run a bath.

186
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:39,343
Sass, here, help me.

187
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:41,971
Get her legs.

188
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:47,649
I have to go back up tomorrow. You're
going to have to take care your mother.

189
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,518
- She's gonna feel sick.
- OK.

190
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:55,192
Give her lots of tea, and water
and let her rest.

191
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:59,104
- OK?
- OK.

192
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:38,541
Out!

193
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,793
You can't come with me.

194
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:50,715
You know these are
exctint. They're gone.

195
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,886
I don't know what your father told
you but he couldn't have seen one.

196
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:59,346
Come on.

197
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,549
Ok, if I see one,
you'll be the first to hear.

198
00:42:47,102 --> 00:42:51,177
- Where's your mother?
- In town with Jack Mindy.

199
00:42:51,186 --> 00:42:55,808
She's better now. Did you find anything?

200
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:02,270
It's not my dad's.

201
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,259
- What are you doing?
- We're going in.

202
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,461
- No, you can't.
- But we always do.

203
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:53,207
- Wait until I finished.
- No, the water'll be cold.

204
00:43:53,777 --> 00:43:56,953
Besides, my dad says when
we have a bath it's shame...

205
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:58,254
...to waste all the hot water.

206
00:43:58,256 --> 00:44:02,581
I am not your dad and I do not
think your mom would like this.

207
00:44:02,592 --> 00:44:04,832
- He tells us a story.
- I do not know any.

208
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:06,234
- None?
- No.

209
00:44:06,335 --> 00:44:08,035
- Not even one story?
- No.

210
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:13,212
- What she keeps singing about then?
- She's just singing.

211
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,104
'bout what though? People
never sing about nothing.

212
00:44:17,229 --> 00:44:19,906
I've never met someone does it.

213
00:44:20,016 --> 00:44:23,430
She can't sing a song about nothing.

214
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:27,053
So what's she singing about?

215
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:33,097
<i>He's back.</i>

216
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:38,055
- I'll better come in.
- I'll be fine.

217
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:40,934
I'll see you soon.

218
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:45,445
Thanks.

219
00:45:08,682 --> 00:45:11,677
Want some water?

220
00:45:13,436 --> 00:45:17,352
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

221
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:23,401
They do not like to waste the hot water.

222
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:27,149
- You guys hungry?
- Yes.

223
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:29,571
I'll get dinner ready.

224
00:45:48,718 --> 00:45:51,963
A tiger in the trees.

225
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:59,889
Which trees? There are
lots of trees out there.

226
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:11,774
The winters up here are something else,
especially when the snow comes.

227
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:14,820
- Shiraz? ( Wine? )
- No.

228
00:46:14,824 --> 00:46:17,899
He drinks tea.

229
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:20,951
- Jamie! Dinner is ready.
- Jamie?

230
00:46:20,954 --> 00:46:26,815
- His new name's Bike.
- Bike? Not a bad name.

231
00:46:27,127 --> 00:46:31,124
What about you, Katie?
Do you have a new name?

232
00:46:31,131 --> 00:46:36,256
- Sass. From "Sassafras".
- That's very pretty.

233
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:39,882
- Jamie?
- I'll go get him.

234
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,890
Hey... time to eat.

235
00:47:05,244 --> 00:47:08,302
- So, Mr. David...
- Call me Martin.

236
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:12,473
Martin, how's the study going?
Those Devils giving you much trouble?

237
00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:15,507
No. Not too much trouble.

238
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:19,380
- I'm getting...
- Oh, Katie, that's disgusting! Sorry.

239
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:23,333
- He likes it stronger.
- Like Jarrah.

240
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:26,259
My husband only liked tea
if it was the colour of rust.

241
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:30,510
- Have you read his book?
- No, I haven't but it's on the top of my list.

242
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:34,309
Run and get daddy's book.

243
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,692
So, what do they teach in
zoology these days Martin?

244
00:47:40,728 --> 00:47:44,327
Same stuff. Hasn't changed
much in the past ten years.

245
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:53,073
Do you know Jude Morris? He's from
your neck of the woods,... Columbia, right?

246
00:47:54,538 --> 00:48:00,414
I couldn't find it. I'm Finished.
Can you tell us a story?

247
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,715
- Martin and I will just have to have a little chat.
After that... - You promised.

248
00:48:03,716 --> 00:48:06,903
After we've had our talk...

249
00:48:17,601 --> 00:48:22,225
Katie said that you
washed me. In the bath.

250
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:24,598
The children helped.

251
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:34,271
I am not a bad mother.

252
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:38,407
It's just hard.

253
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:48,168
What are those speakers in the trees?
Up there.

254
00:48:49,754 --> 00:48:52,015
Umm. Jarrah.

255
00:48:52,052 --> 00:48:55,691
He wanted to have concerts
up here when we first moved.

256
00:48:56,803 --> 00:49:01,928
He had this idea that everyone could gather
here, artists, scientist, town's people...

257
00:49:01,932 --> 00:49:05,303
...like a little Woodstock.

258
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:08,351
He had lots of ideas.

259
00:49:08,355 --> 00:49:12,682
Too many.
Too many to hold in his head at once.

260
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:27,444
We're lucky Jack sent you.

261
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:37,952
Hey everybody, this is Martin David,
like I told you.

262
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:39,689
Hello.

263
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:42,418
What happened to your eye?

264
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,835
- Caught a stick in it.
- Gross-ish.

265
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:51,397
- Where's your mother?
- She's inside. In the kitchen.

266
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:54,866
What's going on?

267
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,481
- We having a little Woodstock?
- You're back!

268
00:54:58,564 --> 00:55:02,349
- Your eye ...oh god! What happened?
- It's fine

269
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:04,874
Come and sit down.

270
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:09,289
Sit down.

271
00:55:16,392 --> 00:55:19,198
It's not too deep.

272
00:55:20,932 --> 00:55:25,631
We got a moratorium... for the logging
in the forest down the road...

273
00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:31,507
Forrestry aren't allowed to touch it for 6 months
not until there's a complete ecologic survey.

274
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,179
- We're celebrating.
- They're friends of yours?

275
00:55:38,182 --> 00:55:43,337
I helped them with their proposal,
interpreted some of their research.

276
00:55:46,766 --> 00:55:50,800
I was doing my PhD in Plant
Science when I met Jarrah.

277
00:55:52,998 --> 00:55:55,838
Ecophysiology.

278
00:55:57,703 --> 00:56:00,835
You look different.

279
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:04,422
Oh, this? Yeah I had it done in town.

280
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:09,826
- Do you like it?
- I liked it better before.

281
00:56:20,806 --> 00:56:26,883
And this has all the signs of a tiger kill.
She eats the heart first.

282
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,392
And this is the cave.
She's been there.

283
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:35,989
She probably has dens all around the
area, and she moved between them...

284
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,334
...but sooner or later
she'll move back here.

285
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,747
I wonder if she's the
last one. Alone. Just...

286
00:56:43,759 --> 00:56:47,217
...hunting and killing, waiting to die.

287
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:17,506
Go on.
We won't tell the University.

288
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:20,559
No.
Thanks, I'm fine.

289
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:26,358
Guess you will be heading home soon
since you got what you wanted.

290
00:57:26,395 --> 00:57:28,950
Nah, got offered a job.
Him 'n me.

291
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,861
- Working for the government.
- Searching for tigers.

292
00:57:34,238 --> 00:57:37,972
- National Parks found a footprint.
- Shhh. It's fucking top secret!

293
00:57:39,064 --> 00:57:40,578
And we know the area, so...

294
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:43,498
There's no tigers up there.

295
00:57:43,535 --> 00:57:47,809
- You don't know that. You only know what they want you to know. 
- Mmmm, Here we go.

296
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:54,233
We'd be sitting on a pile of money if you found
one man, I'm telling you. Cloning and shit.

297
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:59,308
You're a scientist. What would
you do if you found a tiger?

298
00:58:00,428 --> 00:58:01,922
Not my field.

299
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:05,898
I'd just point his nose due west
and tell him to run like the wind.

300
00:58:05,935 --> 00:58:08,757
That's what Jarrah would've done.

301
00:58:08,764 --> 00:58:11,898
Isn't that right Luce?

302
00:58:27,624 --> 00:58:31,943
- Take the kids inside.
- Come on. Katie. Come on.

303
00:58:40,881 --> 00:58:42,869
Listen, fellows...

304
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:44,474
It's not personal.

305
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:47,509
Taking away our jobs is personal mate.

306
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:50,077
- Come on man, there're women & children here.
- Shut up Feral.

307
00:58:50,078 --> 00:58:51,512
Hey, you don't want to do that mate.

308
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:53,827
Yeah.

309
00:58:54,388 --> 00:58:56,682
Ah, Run you little fairies.

310
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:19,595
Come in.

311
00:59:19,938 --> 00:59:21,667
I'm making tea. Would you like some?

312
00:59:21,704 --> 00:59:24,500
- No, thank you.
- You sure?

313
00:59:24,503 --> 00:59:29,892
No. I'm gonna turn it. I got to
go back up early tomorrow morning.

314
00:59:31,932 --> 00:59:34,860
Sorry about tonight.

315
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:40,593
Do you think those people have
something to do with y... your husband?

316
00:59:40,598 --> 00:59:45,361
No. They're angry that they're out
of work but they wouldn't hurt us.

317
00:59:45,545 --> 00:59:48,831
Their kids go to school with my kids.

318
00:59:51,078 --> 00:59:54,813
Jarrah thought that somebody
was following him though.

319
00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:56,855
Not one of the locals.

320
00:59:58,055 --> 01:00:02,133
Well, if not them, who?

321
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:06,256
My husband pissed off a lot of people.

322
01:00:06,266 --> 01:00:11,258
- Did you tell the police?
- Yeah, they said there was no evidence.

323
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:17,109
No, uhh, body. Besides, they knew Jarrah,
his theories, what he was like. So, ...

324
01:00:17,616 --> 01:00:21,610
Do you believe someone was following him?

325
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:25,597
I believe he believed it.

326
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,325
How is it going Mr. Mindy?

327
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:03,892
Hear you had a bit of trouble
up at the house last night?

328
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:05,405
Everything is under control.

329
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,276
Maybe I should talk
to the University...

330
01:01:10,286 --> 01:01:15,698
...find you somewhere else to live,
somewhere with fewer distractions.

331
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:21,496
Lucy is better. She is off the
pills and the kids are fine too.

332
01:01:21,905 --> 01:01:25,316
I don't think you need
to come around so much.

333
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:24,582
- Hello?
- This is Jack Mindy from Tasmania.

334
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:29,102
- Yes, Jack? - You said to call
if there was any problems. - Go on.

335
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:34,687
<i>Well, this scientist of yours,
he's... He's becoming a problem.</i>

336
01:04:43,284 --> 01:04:44,799
<i>Mum</i>

337
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,170
Beer, please.

338
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:49,200
Didn't think you'd be back in here.

339
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,085
Why aren't you up there with
all your other greenie mates, ha?

340
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:58,533
I know what you're up to mate.
Whole fucking town knows about it.

341
01:06:00,412 --> 01:06:03,699
It's a bloody waste of taxes.

342
01:06:08,866 --> 01:06:12,903
You and that fucking Armstrong
bitch deserve each other.

343
01:06:15,945 --> 01:06:17,900
Let him go!

344
01:07:56,542 --> 01:08:00,034
'kay. Good boy.

345
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:19,248
- My Dad was going to fix those.
- Just helping him out, while he's away.

346
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:23,573
- Can I help too?
- Sure.

347
01:08:58,456 --> 01:09:43,448
# MUSIC: Vivaldi <i>Gloria In Excelsis Deo</i>

348
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:00,954
Thank you!

349
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:12,659
- What kind of work was your husband doing up there?
- I don't know if you call it work...

350
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:16,455
Was he working for Red Leaf?

351
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:22,790
I saw their name on the back of
some of the drawings. On the fridge.

352
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:28,367
I thought he burnt it all.
He got very paranoid about, umm.

353
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:33,369
- Why?
- He was hunting a tiger up there.

354
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:40,076
He told me that the tiger had some
unique toxin that paralyzed its prey.

355
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:44,577
And that Red Leaf wanted to own it.
The DNA.

356
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:47,700
Jarrah was trying to stop them.

357
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:54,576
It's probably better off extinct.

358
01:10:54,583 --> 01:11:00,909
If its alive people would always
want to find it. Hunt it down.

359
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:07,866
- Mum? I can't sleep.
- What's the matter Katie?

360
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:13,074
- I'm scared, I want to sleep in your bed, with you.
- Okay, I'm coming.

361
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:17,430
Listen. If it's a nice day tomorrow,
do you want to go on a picnic?

362
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:18,986
Yeah.

363
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,699
- Good night.
- 'Night.

364
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,197
- Can we bring the chook?
- No! - Why not?

365
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:44,201
Because, ...
I don't even know what a chook is.

366
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:47,871
Chooks... the chickens!

367
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,118
Oh, My, Lord. Look at you!

368
01:11:57,417 --> 01:12:01,330
Are you sure you want to be seen with us?

369
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:17,406
Oh, okay, you want him?
It's is for you.

370
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:22,659
He's coming...

371
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:28,911
<i>- Martin David.
- I'm hearing reports.</i>

372
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:33,142
<i>You're attracting too much attention,
getting involved with locals.</i>

373
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:40,532
<i>You need to focus on the job,
or someone else will get there first.</i>

374
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:46,742
I've found a cave...
a kind of den. I've been there.

375
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:50,072
<i>Why aren't you up there now?</i>

376
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:53,655
<i>You need a result.</i>

377
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,822
You'll get your result.

378
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:08,116
Exscuse me.

379
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:26,036
- What are you doing?
- I have to go back up.

380
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:30,706
- I have to finish my work. I have no choice.
- What about the kids?

381
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:35,657
- These are my coordinates, if I'm not back...
- Don't bother.

382
01:18:53,535 --> 01:18:57,133
Get down on your knees,
face away from me.

383
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:11,794
Where's the cave?

384
01:19:11,805 --> 01:19:14,136
What cave?

385
01:19:17,856 --> 01:19:19,508
Hands by your sides, palms up.

386
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:38,661
Where is the cave?

387
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:51,283
- Up there.
- How far?

388
01:19:53,044 --> 01:19:56,615
Two hour climb.

389
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:04,495
You're going to take me there.

390
01:20:13,163 --> 01:20:15,904
Let's go!

391
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:19,324
I can't navigate like this.

392
01:24:06,098 --> 01:24:08,430
Jack!

393
01:24:09,847 --> 01:24:12,633
Jack?

394
01:24:13,349 --> 01:24:15,596
You stay there! You stay there!

395
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:23,667
- Don't you make me.
- Where are they?

396
01:24:26,626 --> 01:24:29,477
It was an accident. Police...

397
01:24:30,454 --> 01:24:31,535
...said it was an accident. All the...

398
01:24:32,765 --> 01:24:38,441
candles, & lanterns, open fire up at that
place, was bound to happen sooner or later.

399
01:24:38,477 --> 01:24:40,334
Where are they now, Jack?

400
01:24:49,885 --> 01:24:53,448
Lucy and the girl... they're dead.
They're. They're dead.

401
01:25:04,568 --> 01:25:06,327
And the boy?

402
01:25:07,498 --> 01:25:12,490
They took him away. I couldn't
look after him, not at my age.

403
01:25:14,163 --> 01:25:17,950
We'll find him a place, somewhere good...

404
01:25:27,493 --> 01:25:32,190
Was someone paying you to
follow me, to keep an eye on me?

405
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:37,022
No. I thought you were
a scientist, like Jarrah.

406
01:25:37,032 --> 01:25:40,194
No one was paying me.

407
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,943
You should never've come here.

408
01:25:44,945 --> 01:25:48,391
What did you tell them, you idiot?

409
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:53,067
They sent someone to replace me.
They'll send someone to replace him...

410
01:25:53,069 --> 01:25:57,515
...and they'll keep on sending people
until they get what they want.

411
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:09,628
What you want is gone forever.

412
01:34:09,639 --> 01:34:14,507
Don't bother looking for me.
I'm going to see the sights.
