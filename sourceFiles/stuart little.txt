1
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:47,046
It's today! lt's today!

2
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,133
It's today! lt's today! It's today!

3
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,968
It's always today, George.

4
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,471
-I mean, this is the day.
-That's right.

5
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,682
-Can't l come?
-You have to go to school, George.

6
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,977
-Will he be here when I get home?
-I think so.

7
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,897
I'll play ball with him.
I'll wrestle with him.

8
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,024
I'll teach him how to spit.

9
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,693
-It's gonna be so much fun.
-For all of us.

10
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,488
How will you know
if you're picking the right one?

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,656
I don't know. We'll....

12
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,075
You'll just know.

13
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,244
Yeah. Bye, sweetie.

14
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,669
Remember, l want a little brother,
not a big brother.

15
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,345
We've been through your paperwork.
Everything seems to be in order.

16
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,305
Adoption isn't for everyone...

17
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,433
...but you seem like people
with plenty of love to share.

18
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,520
So how are you feeling?

19
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,313
-Goodness, we're--
-Tingling--

20
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,731
With anticipation.

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,191
Oh, recess.

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,360
Time for you to meet them.

23
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,696
Feel free to walk around.
They're used to having strangers here.

24
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,657
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

25
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,870
Lovely people.

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,219
Nice move, Red.

27
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,736
Oh, Frederick, look at them.

28
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,739
-How could we possibly--?
-Choose? l know.

29
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,075
-They all seem so--
-Wonderful.

30
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,661
You know what's wonderful?

31
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,374
What's wonderful is how you both know
what the other one is gonna say...

32
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,668
...before you even say it.

33
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,089
Not that it's any of my business.

34
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,927
Yes, well, that happens when you've
been together as long as we have.

35
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,429
From being a family.

36
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,849
A family, wow.

37
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,145
Well, for a family, you've certainly
come to the right place.

38
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,732
I think we can find just
what you're looking for.

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,276
If you want a girl,
Susan can read French.

40
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,863
And Edith over there can tap-dance
while blowing bubbles.

41
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,449
Or maybe you wanted a boy.

42
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,118
Actually, I think we were leaning
towards a boy.

43
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,786
Well, in that case...

44
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,956
...Benny can do handstands.

45
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,460
And Andy can run 1 00 yards faster
than you can say, "Ready, set, go."

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,962
You certainly know a lot
about everyone.

47
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,591
That's what happens when
you've been here as long as I have.

48
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,471
Let's face it. Not everyone wants
to adopt someone like me.

49
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,849
You shouldn't worry about choosing.

50
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,643
It happens the same way every time.

51
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,146
First, you won't know what to do.
You'll be a little bit scared.

52
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,981
Then you'll meet one of them.

53
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,900
You'll talk to him.

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,235
And somehow...

55
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,237
...you just know.

56
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:11,833
Are you quite certain you're prepared
to handle his uniqueness?

57
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,669
Oh, my, yes, yes.

58
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,922
His uniqueness is a perfect fit
for the Little family.

59
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,340
Perfect.

60
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,636
Mr. and Mrs. Little,
we try to discourage couples...

61
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,722
...from adopting children
outside their own...

62
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,226
...species.

63
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,728
It rarely works out.

64
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,356
Well, it will in this case.

65
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,426
Bye, Stuart!

66
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,803
Bye! We'll miss you!

67
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,103
So, what do I call you?

68
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,730
-Mom.
-And Dad.

69
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,733
We haven't told you the best news
of all. You have a brother.

70
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,984
Named George.

71
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,402
A brother!

72
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,822
-What do I call him?
-George.

73
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,580
Well, Stuart, here we are,
the family home.

74
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,291
They say every Little in the world
can find this house.

75
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,251
Even if they've never
been here before.

76
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,630
It's just something inside them.

77
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,557
Something inside.

78
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,143
So would you like a tour?

79
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,187
I don't have any money.

80
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,817
That's Uncle Crenshaw,
Cousin Edgar, Grandpa Spencer.

81
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,652
That's Aunt Beatrice.

82
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,196
And that's George, your brother.

83
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,324
Look, he's already happy to see me.

84
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,079
Well, that's just about everybody,
except for--

85
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,333
Snowbell! Drop him right now!

86
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,003
You spit Stuart out this instant,
Snowbell. Spit him right out.

87
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,340
Stuart, are you all right?

88
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,008
Wait!

89
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,011
I'm fine.

90
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,180
You must never harm Stuart.
You understand?

91
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,391
Never, or out you'll go, Mr. Snow.

92
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,936
Stuart is family now.
We do not eat family members.

93
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,105
Mom, Dad, l'm home!

94
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,400
Is he here? Is my brother here?

95
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,735
-He certainly is.
-Where is he?

96
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,613
He's here. Stuart, this is George.

97
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,076
George, this is Stuart,
your new brother.

98
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,704
No. Really?

99
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,040
Really, George.
This is your new brother.

100
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,878
You look somewhat like a mouse.

101
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,882
Yeah, well,
I am somewhat like a mouse.

102
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,633
I see.

103
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,635
I have to go.

104
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,107
Is it just me or did he seem
a little disappointed?

105
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,195
Well, he's always a little tired
after school.

106
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,447
Perks up around dinnertime.

107
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,248
Meat loaf is delicious, dear.

108
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,042
Cajun.

109
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,755
Shall we get to know each other
a little?

110
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,008
George, don't you have anything
you wanna ask Stuart?

111
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,928
Sure, George. Go ahead.
I'm an open book.

112
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,598
Ask me anything, the first thing
that pops into your head.

113
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,308
Could you pass the gravy?

114
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,024
-Your new bedroom, Stuart.
-We hope you like it.

115
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,027
Sure is roomy.

116
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,204
Good night, Mom.

117
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,165
Good night, Dad.

118
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,627
-Good night, son.
-Good night, sweetie.

119
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,614
Nice kitty.

120
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,366
Nice kitty. Pretty kitty.

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,494
Are you cozy?

122
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,081
Yes, thanks.
I'm quite comfortable.

123
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,167
All I've got to sleep on is a rag
in the corner, you little rat.

124
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,381
-You seem tense.
-Tense? Oh, I'm way past tense.

125
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,842
Well, maybe l can help.

126
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,886
What do you like?
Can I scratch your ears?

127
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,930
I could rub your tummy.

128
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,850
How'd you like to rub it
from the inside, mouse boy?

129
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,353
Sorry, I'm a little confused.
I thought that's what you do with a pet.

130
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,606
A pet? I am not your pet!

131
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,609
I'm a cat. You're a mouse.
You should be living in a hole.

132
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,527
This is my family.

133
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,362
Can't we share them?

134
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,283
Read my furry pink lips: No.

135
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,953
I can't believe this.
I'm arguing with lunch.

136
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,580
And stay away from the windows.

137
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,458
The other cats find out about this,
I'm ruined.

138
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,254
I gotta relax.
Where's my tinkle ball?

139
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,471
-George, time to get up.
-Okay, Mom.

140
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,723
Stuart, you too.

141
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,892
Okay, Mom.

142
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,111
George, l'm trying to get
the laundry started.

143
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,862
Okay.

144
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,453
-In the laundry chute, please.
-Okay.

145
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,835
Thank you.

146
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,595
Oh, dear.

147
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,057
Mom! Hello! Mom!

148
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,644
It's Stuart!
I'm in the washing machine. Mom!

149
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,646
Hello, Mom!

150
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,362
Where are you going?

151
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,959
-That's odd.
-What is?

152
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,588
-I thought someone was at the door.
-You look beautiful, dear.

153
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,508
Honey, should we talk to George
before you go?

154
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,677
-About what?
-About Stuart.

155
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,930
He hasn't exactly
embraced the situation.

156
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,932
Snowbell!
Thank goodness you're here.

157
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,393
Do you believe this?
I'm locked in the washer.

158
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,521
Can you help me?
Can you turn this thing off?

159
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,358
Why would I turn it off?

160
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,944
It's my favorite show.

161
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,032
That's funny.
That's funny, Snowbell.

162
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,618
-You can't leave me!
-Talk to the butt.

163
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,244
Snowbell, where are you going?

164
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,872
I've gotta stare at traffic,
yawn, lick myself.

165
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,794
And believe me, that could take hours
if you do it right. Ciao!

166
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,131
Are you sure that Stuart
is happy here?

167
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,217
Oh, he's having the time of his life.

168
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,553
Help! Somebody, please help me!

169
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,057
Bye.

170
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,150
Hi, Stuart.

171
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,736
Help!

172
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,154
Stuart!

173
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,700
Stuart, where are you?

174
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,161
Stuart. Stuart.

175
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,583
Stuart, are you all right?

176
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,045
I'm okay, Mom. I'm--

177
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,022
Is he gonna be all right?

178
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,777
Well, a lad that size
swallowing all that detergent....

179
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,155
Amazingly,
I think he's gonna be fine.

180
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,577
Also he's very clean.

181
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,793
-Glad you're feeling better, Stuart.
-Me too.

182
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,337
So exciting.
We'll pick out a whole new wardrobe.

183
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,756
Here you go.

184
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,470
Come on, George. This'll be fun.

185
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,390
-I don't wanna go shopping with Stuart.
-George!

186
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,602
-Oh, maybe you should--
-Talk to him? You're right.

187
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,649
So, George, I wanted to talk
to you about Stuart.

188
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,028
I just want you to know that
if you and he were to spend...

189
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,031
...some real time together,
you know, brother time--

190
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,490
Look at that one.

191
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,746
Come on, George.
You have a boat, a beautiful one.

192
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,331
It's not finished.

193
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,917
Well, you better get moving.
The race is soon.

194
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,710
So?

195
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,505
Don't you want to race your boat?

196
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,675
-I'm not so good at the racing part.
-So what?

197
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,679
It doesn't matter about winning.
You try like heck and you have fun.

198
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,265
It's fun to finish last?

199
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,353
Something formal, I should think.

200
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,230
I'm not sure of the fabric,
but it should breathe.

201
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,524
He has a tendency to burrow
and climb...

202
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,777
...and generally scurry about.

203
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,698
Well, I'm sure we can find something
to suit your particular need.

204
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,578
Here we have Barbados Ben.

205
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,039
Chef Ben.

206
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,793
Lumberjack Ben.

207
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,420
And, of course, Gladiator Ben.

208
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,007
Yes.

209
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,636
-Does Ben always dress like this?
-No, no, no, madam.

210
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:17,433
There are many moods of Ben
and it all depends on the occasion.

211
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:22,105
Well, what if the occasion were
a simple family party?

212
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,816
I think I have just the thing.

213
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,404
There they are.

214
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,493
George?

215
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,415
-Shopping?
-Stuart?

216
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,292
-Everything all right in there?
-Don't come in.

217
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,753
Shy.

218
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,174
How do I look?

219
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,344
-Fantastic. l hardly recognize you.
-Very smart.

220
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,096
And you look just like a Little.

221
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,557
I do?

222
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,392
Good.

223
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,270
I was worried
I was gonna look just like Ben.

224
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,738
Hi, auntie.

225
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,158
-Crenshaw!
-Frederick!

226
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,617
Little high, Little low.

227
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,620
Little hey, Little ho!

228
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,790
We come bearing gifts
for young Stuart.

229
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,959
Yes, where is my new nephew?

230
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,378
The Little family's getting
bigger and bigger.

231
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,423
Boy.

232
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,011
That's a lot of Littles.

233
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,388
Uncle Crenshaw!

234
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,561
There's my favorite little nephew.

235
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,980
You can't say that anymore,
Crenshaw.

236
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,858
Right. Now we have two
favorite little nephews.

237
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,403
-Where is the lad?
-He has a lot of gifts to open.

238
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,489
Are any of those for me?

239
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,204
You see, George, well, we thought--

240
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,372
That's exact--
We thought that later--

241
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,752
Attention, everybody.
We'd like to introduce you to someone.

242
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,921
This is Stuart.

243
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,848
Hello, everyone.

244
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,314
-He's a-- A--
-Adorable!

245
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,358
-Adorable.
-Yeah, that's right.

246
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,235
I couldn't think of the word.

247
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,573
Oh, Stuart, look.

248
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,536
Look at that.
This is a real Schmelling.

249
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,372
-Those are the best kind.
-You know what they say:

250
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,708
-"If it ain't Schmelling...."
-"It ain't bowling."

251
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,544
Look here, Stuart.

252
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,714
Climb on up here, son.
Plant your caboose right up here.

253
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,307
He may have to grow into it.

254
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,269
I think he's grown a little
since we've been here.

255
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:11,023
That's what happened to me.
One summer, l just shot right up.

256
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,902
May I say something?

257
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,906
In the orphanage,
we used to tell fairy tales...

258
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,326
...of finding our families
and having a party like this.

259
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,622
A party with cakes and presents
and all varieties of meat loaf.

260
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,793
A party with a big family who came
from far away just to wish us well.

261
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,588
I don't know much about families...

262
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,591
...but this must be the nicest family
in the world, I think.

263
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,760
So I just wanted to thank
each of you.

264
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,221
Because now I know...

265
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,182
...fairy tales are real.

266
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,391
Oh, Stuart.

267
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,977
Fairy tales are real?

268
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,689
I think I'm gonna cough up a fur ball.

269
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,151
Now it's time
for the best present of all.

270
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,779
-It's something for you and George.
-George.

271
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,325
Stand next to Stuart.

272
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:07,330
This is something that gave your father
and me hours of enjoyment...

273
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,791
...when we were young brothers
just like you and Stuart.

274
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:20,301
This ball belonged
to your great-great-grandfather...

275
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,095
...Jedediah Little.

276
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,185
Remember, Frederick, those
long summer days playing catch?

277
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,147
Why don't you take your brother outside
and toss around the old horsehide?

278
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,191
Yeah, what do you say, George?
You ready?

279
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,235
Are you all nuts?

280
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,487
Bicycles and bowling balls?

281
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,158
How will he toss a baseball?
How will he do any of those things?

282
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,702
He's not my brother. He's a mouse.

283
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,834
-Time to go.
-Excellent idea.

284
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,603
What, what, what? Where?

285
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,776
Stuart. Did I hurt you?
What's the matter?

286
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,031
I just wanted to ask you something,
but you were already asleep.

287
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,617
-What did you want to ask us?
-About my real family.

288
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,869
You know, the ones I look like.

289
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,165
He hates us.

290
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,918
We've never been hated before.

291
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,046
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's not that at all.

292
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,382
It's just that...

293
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,010
...something's missing.

294
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,971
I feel an empty space inside me...

295
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,390
...and l just want to know
what was there before.

296
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,059
You have an empty space.

297
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,478
That's so sad.

298
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:59,233
Oh, dear. I hope I haven't left you
dismayed and disappointed.

299
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,152
-No, no, no.
-No. No.

300
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,154
We don't feel dismayed
and disappointed.

301
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,072
Not at all.

302
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,992
-Are you sure?
-We're certain, Stuart.

303
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,747
And if you want us to,
we'll find out about your real parents.

304
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,834
Well, good night, then.

305
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,512
It's out of the question.
And it's against the rules.

306
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,308
Besides, it's very hard
to track mouse families.

307
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,852
They're not very good
with paperwork.

308
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,521
But he has an empty space.

309
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,816
Are there problems with Stuart?

310
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,487
-Problem--? No, not at all.
-No, no.

311
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,281
-Well, there's been a few....
-Difficulties.

312
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,532
Difficulties?

313
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,828
Well, like the cat trying to eat him
when we first brought him home.

314
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,123
He spat the boy right out, of course,
in one heck of a jiffy.

315
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,294
Mrs. Keeper...

316
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,798
...he wants to know about his family.

317
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,217
Any child would have questions
about that.

318
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,804
Yes.

319
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,613
Hey, Snow?

320
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,908
I know that you and I
got off on the wrong paw.

321
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,953
I just wanted to see
if we could start out fresh.

322
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,830
You know? Clean slate.

323
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,582
What do you say?
Wanna be friends?

324
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,044
No.

325
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,339
Okay then.

326
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,677
He's playing with my head.
He's trying to psych me out.

327
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,345
Sick little rodent.

328
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,057
Hey, Snow, let me in! l'm starving!
What's in the dish today?

329
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,226
Oh, no. Monty the Mouth.

330
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,812
He sees Stuart,
it'll be all over the neighborhood.

331
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,272
Let me in.

332
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,940
Go away. There's no food here.

333
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,233
Please.

334
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,988
I'm not picky,
as long as it ain't meat loaf.

335
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,574
That stuff gives me gas
something awful.

336
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,367
Sorry, it's meat loaf.

337
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,620
Oh, well. Beggars can't be choosers.
Load me up and light a match.

338
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,206
Oh, no, no, Monty.
Stop. You don't wanna do that.

339
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,959
Why? I eat from garbage cans,
drink from public toilets.

340
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,713
-Like a little gas is gonna bother me.
-No, wait. Don't!

341
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,382
Oh, great.
What am I gonna tell him now?

342
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,470
Monty, l can explain.

343
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,306
-I-- He's a--
-Explain what?

344
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,309
Explain that you should
stuff your face.

345
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,352
Oh, thanks.

346
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,524
Gee, I don't wanna rush you,
but you really have to leave.

347
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,570
The Littles are due back, and they
don't like strange cats in the house.

348
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,572
Not that you're strange.

349
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,743
Hey, Snow, what's wrong with you?

350
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,244
Nothing.

351
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,413
You know,
you're the one acting strange.

352
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,457
What is it? Worms? Fleas?

353
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,334
Yeah, you look pale.

354
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,922
-Maybe you should see a vet.
-A vet? What a swell idea.

355
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,257
Do you know anybody?
I'm not so happy with mine.

356
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,760
He makes us wait
and his hands are always cold.

357
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,262
-What was that?
-What was that what?

358
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,431
What was that--? What?

359
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,393
Well, I hate to eat and run.

360
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,646
No, no, please. By all means, run.

361
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,731
Run like the wind!

362
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,943
That was gross.

363
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,030
Hey, Snow,
I almost forgot to thank you.

364
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,907
Hey.

365
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,536
What the...?

366
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,913
Oh, no.

367
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,297
Oh, my pants.

368
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,634
Say, they're really putting
some wild prizes in there, huh, Monty?

369
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,515
Oh, hello.
You must be a friend of Snowbell's.

370
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,808
I'm Stuart.

371
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,561
-Aren't you gonna run?
-Why?

372
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,396
Because you're a mouse.

373
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,481
I'm not just a mouse.

374
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,817
I'm also a member of this family.

375
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,154
A mouse with a pet cat.

376
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,535
A mouse with a pet cat!

377
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,497
I guess that is pretty funny.

378
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,251
Pretty funny?
I'm gonna wet my fur!

379
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,045
A mouse with a pet cat!

380
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,840
Your new little master.

381
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,342
Wait till the boys hear about this.

382
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,262
The humiliation.

383
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,891
-I'm gonna kill you!
-Oh, dear.

384
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,269
Come back here!

385
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,418
All right. No more Mr. Nice-Kitty.

386
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,378
You!

387
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,883
Get out of there.
You can't go in there.

388
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,552
That's George's room.
Come back. Come on out.

389
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,264
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna
show you something. Come on.

390
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,784
What are you doing here?

391
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,747
I just thought I'd drop in.

392
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,417
Did you build all these?

393
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,503
Me and my dad.

394
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,924
Wow, this is incredible.
It's like being in a real live Western.

395
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,717
Howdy, partner.

396
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,971
Draw, you lily-livered, yellow-bellied
son of a one-eyed prairie dog.

397
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,435
I'm trying to concentrate.

398
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,313
Sorry.

399
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,985
Is that a train?

400
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,530
What's it look like, picklehead?

401
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:24,034
Could we play with it?
Please, please, please?

402
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,126
Help! Somebody help me!

403
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,673
Help! Please! Somebody help me!

404
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,349
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
-You're crazy.

405
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,394
Hey, I have an idea.

406
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,826
Hop in.

407
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,834
Wow, a roadster.

408
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,420
Go ahead, check it out.

409
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,179
Stuart, what's wrong?

410
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,598
Nothing.

411
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,644
It's just it's the first time I've fit in
since I got here.

412
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,565
What's that?

413
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,943
Oh, that.

414
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,738
That's the Wasp.

415
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,537
She is beautiful.

416
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,874
-Yeah, but she's not finished.
-When are you gonna finish it?

417
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,961
Well, me and my dad were building her,
but I decided to stop.

418
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,296
How come?

419
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,465
I'm too little for a race like that.

420
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,884
Little? You're not little.

421
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,469
Well, not to me.

422
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,180
Stuart, you've never seen
one of these races.

423
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,225
There's hundreds of people there.
Everybody from school.

424
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,602
I mean...

425
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,604
...what if you lost?

426
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,441
Well, at least
you'll have been somewhere.

427
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,571
Come on, George.
What do you say?

428
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,407
Let's get started.

429
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,202
You know...

430
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,412
...I'm not really sure l want a brother.

431
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,250
Well, how about a friend?

432
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,295
I guess I can always use a friend.

433
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,632
-George?
-Yes, Dad?

434
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,133
Have you seen Stuart?

435
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,302
He's down here with me.

436
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,638
What are you doing to him?

437
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,350
He's helping me finish the Wasp.

438
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,604
That's-- That's wonderful, son.

439
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,897
That's terrific.

440
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,316
Can't race her like this.
Right, George?

441
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,610
-Right.
-Well, when's the next race?

442
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,779
-Two days.
-Two days?

443
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,447
We'll be ready.

444
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,075
-Well, how about we all go together?
-Wonderful idea.

445
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,619
-That would be great.
-All of us together.

446
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:17,958
The whole family.

447
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,255
I'm telling you, Snowy,
this guy can fix anything.

448
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,464
But they're alley cats.

449
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,551
They're mean, they're vicious,
they're all hopped up on catnip.

450
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,762
Quit being such a scaredy-cat.
You wanna get rid of the mouse?

451
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,848
-Of course I do.
-All right, then.

452
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,975
Hey! Hey, Smokey!

453
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,853
Smokey, it's me. It's me, Monty.

454
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,062
What is it now?

455
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,982
Well, my friend Snowbell here
needs a favor.

456
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,692
Snowbell?

457
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,527
Now there's a manly name.

458
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,156
Yeah. You see, sir,
I've got this mouse at home l can't eat.

459
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,741
Sensitive stomach?

460
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:55,662
No. I can't eat him because
he's a member of the family.

461
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,706
A mouse with a pet cat?

462
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,499
Isn't that funny?

463
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,501
That's not funny.

464
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,087
That's sick.

465
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,506
A cat can't have a rodent
for a master.

466
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,718
What's this world coming to?
It's against the laws of nature.

467
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,721
Word of this gets out,
it'll be bad for cats all over.

468
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,099
-So you think you can help me?
-Consider it done.

469
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,020
Did you hear that, Monty?
Thank you, Mr. Smokey, sir.

470
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,189
I'll never forget this. Really.

471
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,858
Don't worry, Tinker Bell.
I'm all over it.

472
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,112
Tinker Bell!
He called me Tinker Bell.

473
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,365
-You're a funny guy.
-Yeah, whatever.

474
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,034
Jeez, house cats.

475
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,203
Are you sure
he'll keep this hush-hush?

476
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,039
You kidding? Cat's got his tongue.
Get it?

477
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,208
Cat's got his tongue,
because he's a cat.

478
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,377
-Shut up.
-Okay.

479
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,298
Ahoy, fellow yachtsmen!

480
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:53,553
And welcome, everyone, to the
92nd annual Central Park Boat Race...

481
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:57,808
...undoubtedly model racing's
most prestigious event.

482
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,103
Children from all over New York
gather here every year...

483
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,230
...to see whose boat will prevail.

484
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:07,734
Who will win the race
and take home the magnificent trophy?

485
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,738
-Anchor up?
-Check.

486
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,616
-Stays all battened?
-Check.

487
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,952
-Rudder?
-Check.

488
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,246
-Sail?
-Check.

489
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,915
-Third line?
-Check.

490
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,291
They're doing checks.

491
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,752
So, George, Stuart,
would you like a hot dog?

492
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,087
-Check.
-Check.

493
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,798
And from Manhattan's
Upper West Side...

494
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,551
...the Wasp,
piloted by George Little.

495
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,554
Well, everything appears
to be in shipshape.

496
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,099
But to be on the safe side,
I better check the hull for leaks.

497
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,270
--the Lillian B. Womrat,
piloted by Anton....

498
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,439
Oh, no. Anton.

499
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,777
Gee, George, what did you do,
get that out of a cereal box?

500
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,947
I'm glad you're here, George.

501
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,283
Someone's gotta finish last.

502
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,372
I don't like that child.

503
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,208
All set to get under way.

504
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,471
It's time to get those boats in the water
and grab your remote.

505
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,473
Stuart, could you get the remote?

506
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,807
Aye, aye, captain.

507
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,366
Doesn't she look great?

508
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,750
Are you okay?

509
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,544
-Maybe we should go home.
-Why?

510
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,838
I'm not wearing my lucky underwear.

511
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,882
You don't have lucky underwear.

512
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,844
Well, maybe we should get some
and then come back for another race.

513
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,525
George, listen, l know how worried
you are about losing, believe me.

514
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,402
But you know what we say?
The thing that really matters...

515
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,405
...is to never stop trying. Okay?

516
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,200
-Okay.
-That's the spirit.

517
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,706
Everyone to your places.
The race is about to start.

518
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,878
Where's Stuart?

519
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,216
Look out, sir!

520
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,429
One minute to race time,
ladies and gentlemen.

521
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,766
-Stuart, are you hurt?
-Stuart, what happened?

522
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,561
It was completely my fault.
I couldn't grip it.

523
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,563
Nice going, Captain Loser.

524
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,276
All set to get under way.

525
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,444
All boats on the starting line
immediately.

526
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,238
George, wait.

527
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,576
Oh, honey.
Everything will be all right.

528
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,911
No, it won't.

529
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:10,125
Maybe we could fix it, huh?
A little glue. Who'll know?

530
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,252
Mom.

531
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:17,757
This is awful. Our first family outing.
I ruined everything.

532
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,636
Well, you know, Stuart...

533
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,680
...these things happen.

534
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,850
But what about George?

535
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,188
I'll be right back.

536
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,531
George, you know what?

537
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,450
Just because
we can't be in the race...

538
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,203
...doesn't mean our family outing
has to be ruined.

539
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:51,458
-I really think--
-All boats to your marks. Ready and:

540
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,170
And the race is on.

541
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,797
I think we should just go home.

542
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:02,135
The sails are full and--
There's a mouse on that boat?

543
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,180
Stuart!

544
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,143
-George!
-Stuart!

545
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,856
-What are you doing?
-Sailing. I hope.

546
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,358
Come back here this minute.

547
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,984
-I can't.
-Why not?

548
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,653
I don't know how!

549
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,948
The competitors are jockeying
for position.

550
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,242
Frederick, l don't like this one bit.

551
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,160
Your mother doesn't like this one bit.

552
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,204
I'm okay, Mom!

553
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,705
Go, Stuart!

554
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,000
-Tighten the mainsail!
-What's a mainsail?

555
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,337
Once the boats
get past the footbridge....

556
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,841
Move!

557
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,302
Come on, Stuart!

558
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,514
-Gee, George, you all done crying?
-Yeah.

559
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,017
-You all done being a jerk?
-No.

560
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,144
Don't worry, George!
I won't let you down!

561
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,856
Away the boats are sailing....

562
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,704
Frederick, what if he falls?

563
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,957
Remember,
he's quite a fine swimmer.

564
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,146
Hey, that's cheating.
You can't do that.

565
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,815
Well, I just did.

566
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,572
Oh, dear.

567
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,693
-What is he doing?
-I think he's hiking out.

568
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,959
Hope that mouse can swim.

569
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,465
-The Wasp is gonna take the lead.
-Stuart, look out!

570
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,396
That can't be good.

571
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,731
Look what that stupid mouse did
to my sail!

572
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,483
He's not a stupid mouse.

573
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,902
You're right. He's a stupid rat.

574
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,331
-Hey, hey, hey, come on.
-Get off me. Get off!

575
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,166
George.

576
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,007
Stuart!

577
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,605
Something's wrong.

578
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,358
What's happening?

579
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,923
Yeah!

580
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,937
Who is that mouse, anyway?

581
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:26,232
That's no mouse.
That's my brother.

582
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,957
Little high, Little low!

583
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,001
Little hey, Little ho!

584
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,090
Oh, Frederick, look at them.

585
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,180
You know what?

586
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,599
This calls for a picture.

587
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,108
What's wrong?

588
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,694
Well, it's just...

589
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,948
...you four look great together.

590
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,869
This is the happiest moment
of my life.

591
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,498
I feel 1 0 inches tall.

592
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,004
I'll get that.

593
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,510
-Mr. Little.
-Yes?

594
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,512
Down here.

595
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,931
Very sorry to disturb you
at your lovely abode.

596
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,141
I hope we're not intruding.

597
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,603
My name's Reginald Stout.
This is my wife, Camille.

598
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,480
An extreme pleasure.

599
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,482
We're looking for Stuart.

600
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,526
Are you friends of his?

601
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,945
Well, not exactly.

602
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,573
-Fellow yachtsmen?
-Guess again.

603
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,491
Reggie, just tell them.

604
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,493
We're his parents.

605
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,341
Reggie, stop it!

606
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,432
It's so good to see you again, Stuart.

607
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,518
There's so much
we have to catch up on.

608
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,105
Why didn't you want me?

609
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,066
Stuart, it shames me to say this...

610
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,569
...but you weren't born
into a prosperous home.

611
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:38,031
That's right.
We couldn't feed you, dear.

612
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,575
Couldn't feed him?
How much could he eat?

613
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,035
George, please.

614
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:46,205
Letting you go was the toughest
choice we ever made.

615
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,374
-It was?
-Yes.

616
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,002
But now we can be a family again.

617
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,047
Absolutely. Are these salted?

618
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,260
Dear. The children.

619
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:03,556
Yeah. George, Stuart, l think
we need to talk to the Stouts alone.

620
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,271
Don't worry.
Mom and Dad will take care of it.

621
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,237
-I'm afraid there's been a mistake.
-Right.

622
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:21,199
Stuart can't leave with you. He's--

623
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,950
-One of the family.
-Exactly.

624
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:26,746
You may feel like he's family,
but he'll never really be family.

625
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:31,125
You may not realize it,
but I'm sure he does.

626
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,753
There's something
you'll never be able to give him...

627
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,546
...because you're human.
No offense.

628
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,091
It's a place that
you'll never be able to fill.

629
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,594
An empty space.

630
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,931
Mom...

631
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,101
...Dad, you want me to leave?

632
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:52,105
-No.
-Dear, we just want what's best for you.

633
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,107
But Stuart lives here.

634
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,651
George, come on.
This is hard for all of us.

635
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,194
This stinks!

636
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,035
I don't understand.

637
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,246
I thought I was in a fairy tale.

638
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,665
Fairy tales are made-up stories,
Stuart.

639
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,835
This is real.
This is about where you belong.

640
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,422
Please, come home, Stuart.
Your real home.

641
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,883
You're gonna love it, son.
We live on a golf course.

642
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,011
-We look right over the main fairway.
-It's beautiful.

643
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,013
Beautiful.

644
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,060
Hey, taxi!

645
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,647
What's a mouse have to do
to get a cab in this city?

646
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,825
You'll speak to George for me,
won't you?

647
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,203
I'd hate to say goodbye
to a basement door.

648
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,248
Of course.

649
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,833
Taxi!

650
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,836
Yo, yo, taxi!

651
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,423
Time to go, Stuart.

652
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,306
Well, goodbye.

653
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,816
We love you.

654
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,863
I love you, too, Mom.

655
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,033
Mrs. Little.

656
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,903
Boy, that looks heavy.
You need some help with that?

657
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,571
Camille?

658
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,992
Frederick, let's do something.

659
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,244
What?

660
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,997
Let's just make them go away.
We're bigger than they are.

661
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,167
We'll say, "Go, shoo."
We'll scare their little whiskers off.

662
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,378
Eleanor, you're not being rational.

663
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,671
Rational, shmational.

664
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,924
Something about this is not right.
I just know it.

665
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,094
Look at them. They just fit.

666
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,806
So what? l have shoes that fit
and I hate them. As Stuart's mother--

667
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,516
But you're not.

668
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,018
She is.

669
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,189
Stuart!

670
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,277
Wait!

671
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,529
George?

672
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,618
I want you to have this.

673
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,453
Oh, George.

674
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,791
Not the roadster, George.
You love this car. I couldn't.

675
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,293
I want you to.

676
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,670
Thanks, George.

677
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,797
I wish you didn't have to go.

678
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,757
I'm gonna miss you.

679
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,302
I'll miss you, too, George.

680
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:32,385
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie

681
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,553
That's amore

682
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,847
Sing with me, Stuie!

683
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:41,936
When the world seems to shine
Like you had too much wine

684
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,527
Tell me your favorite foods
so I can fix them for you, Stuart.

685
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,320
What for? You can't cook.

686
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,656
But I can learn. We're a family now.

687
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,242
There's a lot of adjustments
we'll all have to make.

688
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,246
-Right, Reggie?
-Right, Camille.

689
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,416
Here we are, Stuie, the family home.

690
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,251
The family home.

691
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,378
Mind you,
this is just our summer place.

692
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,172
Winter, we live in a crawlspace
above a delicatessen.

693
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,424
You like corned beef?

694
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,592
-How's it prepared?
-Prepared?

695
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,846
It drops out of a fat guy's mouth,
we grab it and run.

696
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:22,268
-Sounds like an acquired taste.
-Acquired taste? l love this kid!

697
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,437
Your new bedroom, Stuart.

698
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,522
We hope you like it.

699
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:32,111
Well, good night. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

700
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,993
Hey, I'm serious about those bedbugs.
Keep an eye open.

701
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,834
It's very kind of you
to check on us like this.

702
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,880
Actually, I had something to tell you.

703
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,342
But first, how are things going?

704
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,220
-Oh, it's been difficult.
-Difficult?

705
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:42,306
-No, very difficult.
-Very difficult?

706
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,725
-Worse.
-Worse than very difficult?

707
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,521
-Yes, it's been almost--
-Unbearable.

708
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,606
Just the word I was looking for.

709
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,692
Oh, maybe
this isn't a good time, then.

710
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,612
You see, I came over
to give you some news.

711
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,905
What type of news?

712
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,201
-They had an accident.
-Who?

713
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,536
Stuart's parents.

714
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,123
Oh, my goodness.
Well, are they all right?

715
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,126
No. They didn't make it.

716
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,045
-Oh, no. Oh, my--
-What happened?

717
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:17,591
Well, apparently they were grocery
shopping, canned-food aisle.

718
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:21,053
There was an unsteady pyramid of cans
and it collapsed.

719
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,264
Took three bag boys to dig them out.

720
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,975
They had to identify them
by their dental records.

721
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,227
Oh, how horrible!

722
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,856
Cream of mushroom soup.
Two-for-one sale.

723
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,150
That's a very heavy soup.

724
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,235
How is Stuart taking it?

725
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,736
Well, he doesn't know.

726
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,738
You mean no one's told him?

727
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,116
Does he have to know?

728
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:45,744
Six months after they don't come back,
won't he wonder where they went?

729
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,122
But they've been gone for years.

730
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,167
Years? How is that possible?

731
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,962
Because they died years ago.
Which part is confusing you?

732
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,590
Stuart's parents took him away
three days ago.

733
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,134
Three days ago?
Stuart's parents died...

734
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,470
...in a tragic cream-mushroom-soup
incident years ago.

735
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,930
I just told you.

736
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,058
Dear, we have to take this up
with the police.

737
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,906
-Mrs. Little?
-Yes.

738
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,326
I'm Detective Sherman.
This is my partner, Detective Allen.

739
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,537
-We understand your son is missing.
-Thank you for coming.

740
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,373
They know about the Stouts!
They know about the Stouts!

741
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,960
-The jig is up! What are we gonna do?
-Hey, get ahold of yourself.

742
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,130
I'm in big--!
I'm in deep poopy-do!

743
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,133
Calm down, calm down.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.

744
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,718
All we need is a new plan.

745
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,305
We do what we should've done
in the first place.

746
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,141
-We scratch him out.
-Scratch him out?

747
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,018
But, Smokey,
the police are involved.

748
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,062
I don't wanna get kicked out
of my house.

749
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,189
I'm not a street cat.
I'm a house cat.

750
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,984
I don't wanna lose my furry basket or
my tinkle ball that I push with my nose.

751
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,153
No, buddy, pull yourself together.

752
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,738
It's settled.

753
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,700
Stuart Little gets scratched tonight.

754
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,509
Okay. Very good.

755
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:27,221
Mr. and Mrs. Little,
you'll have to come downtown.

756
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,356
Detective Sherman, what are
our chances of seeing Stuart again?

757
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,566
You want it straight?

758
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,070
-No.
-Absolutely not.

759
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,198
Well, in that case...

760
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,368
...Stuart's probably home right now
waiting for you.

761
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,708
Maybe we should hear it
a little straighter than that.

762
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:59,295
Okay. In a case like this...

763
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,548
...if the kidnappers have not called
by now...

764
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,426
...then they're not interested
in money.

765
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,720
-What are they interested in?
-Kicks.

766
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:08,929
Exactly.

767
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,181
It's my guess these two sickos...

768
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:15,311
...are on some kind of cross-country
mouse-killing spree.

769
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,771
-Oh, no.
-Well, thank you.

770
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,025
-Yes, you can kiss this boy goodbye.
-Thank you, detective.

771
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,986
It's over. The things l've seen.

772
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,072
Phil, where is that book
on the grisly photos?

773
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,117
-Believe me, you don't want to see this.
-No. Well--

774
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,910
It'll only take a second.

775
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,459
Right off the bat. Look at this one.

776
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,502
This one kept me awake for weeks.

777
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,938
What did they want?

778
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,776
Where's the boy?

779
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,153
Oh, no.

780
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,950
Stuart, wake up.

781
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,495
-Get dressed.
-Why?

782
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,122
-We're taking you for a ride.
-Where are we going?

783
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,291
Friends of ours have gathered
to meet you.

784
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,127
A gathering? What should I wear?

785
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,213
It doesn't matter. Wear anything.

786
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,841
-Is it formal?
-Just put something on!

787
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,804
Why is Mom crying?

788
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:37,309
Mom? I'm not angry at you
for putting me up for adoption.

789
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:43,107
And now that l'm a Stout again,
I'll always be here to take care of you.

790
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,319
Because that's what families do.

791
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,822
Mom, they take care of each other.

792
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,704
Tell him the truth!

793
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,083
You made a deal with a cat?

794
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,836
He cornered us at the bottom
of a cup on the fifth hole.

795
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,003
It was curtains.

796
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,173
-So you agreed to pose as my parents?
-Yes.

797
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,218
-You lied and cheated?
-Yes.

798
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:15,013
You took me away from the Littles
just when we were all so happy?

799
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,807
-Yes!
-Yes!

800
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,559
That's wonderful.

801
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,019
I think you missed something.

802
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:24,982
That's why I've been feeling so sad.
That's why I keep thinking of them.

803
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,026
I'm not a Stout. I'm a Little.

804
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:33,991
I'm Stuart Little!

805
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,120
Stuart, please.
You have to listen to us.

806
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,206
The cats have decided you're too risky
to keep around anymore.

807
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,375
They ordered us
to hand you over to them.

808
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:47,045
As your fake father,
I order you to run.

809
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,547
-I'll go home.
-Home?

810
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,759
That's miles from here. lt's dark out.
Every cat in the city is looking for you.

811
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,803
Besides, you could get lost.

812
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,055
No. No, l can't.

813
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,975
Every Little in the world
can find the Little house.

814
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,565
Bye, fake father!
Goodbye, fake mother!

815
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,568
-Goodbye, fake son.
-Goodbye, Stuart.

816
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,571
I'm gonna miss that boy.

817
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,073
I'm gonna miss that car.

818
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,124
-George.
-Well, l think we have to--

819
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,251
-Tell him.
-Yeah.

820
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,426
-Who has the glue?
-I'm the glue man.

821
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,096
-What's going on?
-We're making posters.

822
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,349
-We'll put them up all over the city.
-Right.

823
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,101
They describe Stuart
and offer a reward.

824
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,436
Isn't it wonderful?

825
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,356
It was all George's idea.

826
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,403
George.

827
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,366
Never stop trying. Right, Dad?

828
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,453
Listen,
I'm afraid this isn't gonna work.

829
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,955
Why not?

830
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,542
Frederick.

831
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:12,297
Because there's no picture.
We need a picture of Stuart.

832
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,799
The family photo.

833
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,730
Smokey. Hey, Smokey!

834
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,900
-Keep it down.
-Hey, it's me, Lucky.

835
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,821
I just heard from the Brooklyn cats.
Bad news. The Stouts squealed.

836
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,656
I knew those mice were rats.

837
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,950
The kid's on his way home.
What do we do?

838
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,953
No problem. He's gotta go
through the park, right?

839
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,372
Let's meet him
and have ourselves a little picnic.

840
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:50,919
-Oh, great. I'll bring herring.
-Hey, moron! The mouse is the picnic.

841
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,570
Every Little in the world
can find the Little house.

842
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,740
I'm a Little. I'm a Little.

843
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,742
I'm a little lost.

844
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,096
How you doing?

845
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,514
You must be Stuart.

846
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:29,101
Actually, I must be going.

847
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,519
What's your hurry, Murray?

848
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,272
Yeah, where are you going, Murray--?
Stuart? What's his name?

849
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,360
Hey! Come back here, you little rat!

850
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,279
-He's getting away!
-Lucky, Red, get him. Come on!

851
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,366
-Going backwards!
-He's a hell of a driver!

852
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,118
-Go, go, go!
-Oh, cool. We got him.

853
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,121
-I got him, Smokey.
-No, I got him.

854
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,457
The only thing you guys got
are big mouths.

855
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,959
So shut up and run.

856
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,217
-Geronimo!
-Banzai!

857
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,553
Come on, come on, come on.

858
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,638
-We got him now.
-Come on.

859
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,397
-I got him! I got him!
-Get him, Red, get him!

860
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,869
-I hope he runs out of gas.
-I hope you do.

861
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,037
-Run in the back.
-I can't help it.

862
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,539
I have a nervous stomach.

863
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,375
And l have an empty stomach!
Now get that mouse.

864
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,724
Did you see that? Damn.

865
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,851
Nobody could've survived that.
Right, boss?

866
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,228
Yeah, the mouse is sleeping
with the fishes.

867
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,814
Long, wet nap.

868
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,401
Hey, the sewer rat's alive! After him!

869
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,029
No way. I'm a cat. l don't do water.

870
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,280
All right, Red, you go.

871
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,949
Oh, no.
You want to do water, hire a spaniel.

872
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:12,454
I don't believe this. What are you guys,
a bunch of house cats?

873
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,925
Oh, no.

874
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:27,260
Oh, no! Oh, dear.

875
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,388
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

876
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:43,443
Crenshaw, Tina, Uncle Stretch,
you go uptown.

877
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,570
Cover as many streets as you can.

878
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:49,741
Edgar, Beatrice, Spencer,
you take downtown.

879
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,286
-Every side street and back alley.
-All right.

880
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,913
Estelle.

881
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,250
You better go with them.

882
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,253
Where do l go?

883
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,880
You come with us.
We're gonna circle the park.

884
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,387
Okay.

885
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,936
You're making a lot of stops.

886
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:26,611
I made it.

887
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:30,699
I can't believe it. l'm home.

888
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:31,950
Mom! Dad!

889
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,869
I'm coming!

890
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,634
Mom, Dad, George!

891
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:53,305
It's me, Stuart! l'm back!

892
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,641
Mom!

893
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,978
Dad! George!

894
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,479
Where is everybody?

895
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,315
There's nobody else here.

896
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:06,192
It's just you and me, kid.

897
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:07,819
Where'd they go?

898
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,155
Movies, I think.

899
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,157
-Movies?
-Oh, yeah.

900
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,910
Ever since you left,
it's just movies, parties...

901
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,621
...roller-skating, amusement parks.

902
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,998
They're having the time
of their lives.

903
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,709
-They are?
-Oh, sure.

904
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:27,881
Stuart, I hate to have to tell you this,
but they're celebrating.

905
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:29,758
Celebrating what?

906
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,594
-Can't you guess?
-No.

907
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,430
They were just so happy
to get rid of you.

908
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:39,351
That's a lie. I don't believe that.

909
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,394
Oh, boy.

910
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:45,607
I wish I could spare you this.
This is gonna break your little heart.

911
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,192
Look up there.

912
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,277
At what?

913
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,239
See for yourself.

914
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,224
They did that right after you left.

915
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:22,978
Mrs. Little said, "Who wants to look
at that face anymore?"

916
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,105
-She did?
-Yeah.

917
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:29,234
-And George?
-She gave it to him, and he tore it up.

918
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,236
-He did?
-Yeah.

919
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:34,823
I'd give you the pieces,
but Mr. Little set them on fire.

920
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:39,744
I tried to warn you, Stuart.
I told you it wasn't gonna work out.

921
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,997
I should've known.

922
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,124
It was too good to be true.

923
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,251
What are you gonna do now?

924
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,420
I don't know. l guess I'll just--

925
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,547
Leave immediately? Good idea.

926
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,465
I'll tell the family you dropped by...

927
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:55,427
...although it'll probably just
make them sick.

928
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:14,446
Bye, Snowbell.

929
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,990
Goodbye, buddy.

930
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:20,577
This is killing me.

931
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:23,747
George.

932
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,373
But I'm almost done.

933
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,792
Come on. lt's getting late.
Time to go home.

934
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,254
-I don't think I missed a single tree.
-You did a great job.

935
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:34,799
-It was a good idea, wasn't it?
-You bet it was.

936
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,218
It's a really good picture of Stuart.

937
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,680
I don't think you could take
a bad picture of Stuart.

938
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,474
Now all we have to do...

939
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:47,312
...is wait until somebody calls
and tells us where Stuart is.

940
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,938
Right.

941
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:44,202
If we don't find Stuart,
it's gonna break his heart.

942
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:52,168
Snow! One of the guys spotted Stuart
in the park. Smokey sent me to get you.

943
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:55,547
Gee, Monty, I'm in for the night.
It's late.

944
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,758
Besides, Stuart is gone.
Can't we just give the kid a break?

945
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,426
Of course we could.

946
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:03,221
First we'll break his little arms,
then his little legs.

947
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,681
And then we'll take a break.

948
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:07,433
First we gotta find him.
Come on, we gotta run.

949
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:10,562
Why do we have to run?
What is it, festival seating?

950
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:16,192
Come on! l think we're getting closer.
I can smell him.

951
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,902
Sorry, Smokey, that was me.

952
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,197
Didn't your mothers warn you not
to go into Central Park at night?

953
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:24,409
My mother was the reason you didn't
go into Central Park at night.

954
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,077
Yeah, you tell him, Smokey.

955
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,956
Yeah, she was one tough broad.
She was a saint.

956
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,419
Quick question. Who knows CPR?

957
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,130
There are mouse prints
going everywhere.

958
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,174
-How will we find him?
-We'll split up...

959
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,135
-...and go in different directions.
-What a brain.

960
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,429
That is why he is
gatto di tutti i gatti.

961
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,599
You guys go ahead.

962
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:50,101
I'll just collapse right here.

963
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:06,951
Stuart, is that you?
What are you doing up there?

964
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,245
I'm settling in.

965
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,497
Look, Stuart,
you gotta get out of here.

966
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:15,126
This is Central Park. It's dark out.
There are hungry cats all over.

967
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,462
-Stuart, where are you?
-It's your pal, Monty.

968
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,130
-What's he doing here?
-Come out!

969
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,633
-He'll hear you.
-Why shouldn't he hear me?

970
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:26,304
Snowbell! Buddy!
What are you doing up there?

971
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,181
Oh, no. Perfect.

972
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:32,185
Hey, you found him. Attaboy!

973
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:36,147
Hey, everybody!
Over here! Hey, guys!

974
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,191
Snow found him!

975
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,984
Nice going, house cat.

976
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:43,655
Just for that, when we carve up
the mouse, you get the big half.

977
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:47,033
Big half? Snowbell,
what's he talking about?

978
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,369
Do you know those cats?

979
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,663
Not really.
We went to a few parties, but--

980
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,164
What's the matter?

981
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:57,043
-What are you waiting for?
-Bring him down! I'm starving!

982
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,298
-Snowbell.
-Sorry, kid.

983
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,509
Snowbell-- Wait, no. Stop. Wait!

984
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,010
-No! Put me down!
-Buddy!

985
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:09,639
Hit me! l'm open!
I'll break his fall with my mouth!

986
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,516
I guess you do know them.

987
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,018
Hey, let him go!
I can almost taste him!

988
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,187
What are you waiting for?

989
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,647
Hey, where are you going?

990
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,691
He's hogging the mouse.
He ain't sharing.

991
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,859
-Get him!
-He's getting away!

992
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,695
-Let's get him!
-Go! Go!

993
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:27,323
Snowbell. Watch it.
Where are you going?

994
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,200
Hold that branch for me.

995
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,412
-My face.
-Get him!

996
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:39,085
Snowbell. You saved me?

997
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,837
Yeah, yeah.

998
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:44,632
Look, let's get one thing straight.
I'm doing this for the Littles, all right?

999
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,801
They love you. George loves you.

1000
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,554
They're all miserable without you.

1001
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,889
But, Snowbell, you said--

1002
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,225
I know what I said. I--

1003
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:57,729
I lied, okay?
Welcome to Manhattan.

1004
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:00,023
I'm the one that hates you.

1005
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:04,402
Snowbell. You do care.

1006
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,535
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
That's enough.

1007
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,412
Snow, what's he doing to your leg?

1008
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,624
I can't help but think this is wrong.

1009
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,251
What the hell's going on here?

1010
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:25,089
Look, Smokey, call me fickle...

1011
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,842
...but I want to call
this whole thing off, okay?

1012
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,094
Too late.

1013
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,972
Come on, Smokey.
Can't we talk it over?

1014
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,975
You know, Stuart's not so bad
once you get to know him.

1015
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,852
And he's got his own car.

1016
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,396
Careful, house cat.
You're asking for it.

1017
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:43,858
Snow, what are you doing? Come on!
He's just a mouse.

1018
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,778
He's not just a mouse. He's--

1019
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,281
He's--

1020
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,492
He's family.

1021
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:56,454
Oh, yeah.
I can see the resemblance.

1022
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:01,376
Is that what you think?
You have to look alike to be family?

1023
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:05,630
You don't have to look alike.

1024
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,424
You don't even have to like each other.
Look at Snowbell.

1025
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:12,553
He hates me.
And still, he's trying to save me.

1026
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,931
Sure, you'll probably
scratch him up pretty bad.

1027
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:17,183
You'll tear him to shreds.
May even kill him.

1028
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,143
But Snowbell will not run away.

1029
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:26,150
And that is what family is all about.
Right? Snow?

1030
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:29,487
Maybe "family" is too strong a word.

1031
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,531
-Scratch them both.
-Both?

1032
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,577
Hey, it's me you want!
Come and get me!

1033
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:39,163
-Here we go!
-Let me at him!

1034
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,418
Get him!

1035
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:47,839
-Let's go!
-Watch it! Out of my way!

1036
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,592
Get him! Get him! He's getting away!

1037
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:06,232
-Did he fall in the water?
-I don't know. I saw something hit.

1038
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,527
Man, did you see that?
Gone. He just disappeared.

1039
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,195
Hey, there he is!

1040
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:13,865
Up there!

1041
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,825
He's too far. l can't reach him.

1042
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:21,122
In that case, you can all go home.
Prowl safely.

1043
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,584
Here you go, boys. Dinner's served.

1044
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:26,377
All right, Smokey. Way to go!

1045
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:27,879
Oh, dear.

1046
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:30,631
Look, it's mouse on a stick.
I love mouse on a stick.

1047
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:35,720
A little further.
Keep him coming. Keep him coming.

1048
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:38,806
All right, I can almost reach him.
Keep it coming.

1049
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,433
I got him. He's mine.

1050
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,480
-Hey!
-What the--?

1051
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,398
The branch is gonna....

1052
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,775
Well, what have we got here?

1053
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:52,236
Snow, don't come out here!
The branch is breaking!

1054
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:56,908
-Stuart, are you all right?
-Yeah. Yeah, l'm okay.

1055
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,951
Hang on. I'll take it from here.

1056
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:00,745
Take what?

1057
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,001
Hey, come on, Snow.
You wouldn't do this to me.

1058
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,921
Not your old buddy.

1059
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:14,842
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm sure you'll land...

1060
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,136
-...on your--
-Snow, what are you doing?

1061
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,305
Wait! I gotta ask you something!

1062
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,098
--feet!

1063
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,313
Cold! Cold! Cold water!

1064
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,981
I can't swim.

1065
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:32,068
-Dog paddle.
-Dog paddle? l'd rather drown.

1066
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:34,278
And l had my fur
just the way l like it.

1067
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:37,406
I'll be licking myself for days.

1068
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:43,120
How could he do this to me,
after all we've meant to each other?

1069
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,042
I mean, I love that guy!

1070
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,795
Hey, you guys! Wait up for me!

1071
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,924
Pack up the pineapple, Stuart.
This luau's over.

1072
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,635
Thanks, Snowbell. You were great.

1073
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:00,388
Well, it must've been quite a show
from up there.

1074
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:05,309
-Snowbell.
-Those cats think they're so tough.

1075
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:07,687
-Snowbell?
-I guess I showed them.

1076
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,231
Not bad for a house cat.

1077
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,400
Not bad for a dead house cat.

1078
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,865
Say good night, Tinker Bell.

1079
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,577
Hey, Smokey!

1080
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,331
His name is Snowbell.

1081
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:41,345
Oh, this water's damn cold.
I can't believe this!

1082
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:47,393
Beaten by a mouse and his pet cat.
What could be worse?

1083
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,604
Nice doggy! No! No!

1084
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,649
Little high, Little low.

1085
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:56,193
Little hey, Little ho.

1086
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:00,031
Let's go home.

1087
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,578
You know, Snow,
I don't know how to thank you.

1088
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,706
How about not kicking me in the sides?
I'm beginning to bruise.

1089
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:12,960
Sorry. I was getting excited.
I've never ridden a cat bareback before.

1090
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,712
Well, don't get used to it.

1091
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,839
Hold on, cowboy.

1092
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:28,559
-Thanks for the ride.
-Don't mention it. Ever.

1093
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:52,416
Mom! Dad! George!

1094
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,420
It's me, Stuart! l'm back!

1095
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,594
Stuart!

1096
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,265
Mom! Dad! George!

1097
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,811
I missed you all so much.
I thought I'd never see you again.

1098
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:14,021
I don't understand.
How did you manage it?

1099
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:18,901
Every Little in the world can find
the Little house. And Snowbell.

1100
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,070
I just couldn't have done it
without him.

1101
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,281
Really?

1102
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:26,075
What's the matter?

1103
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,285
I was just thinking.

1104
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:29,787
What, dear?

1105
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,248
That this is how people look....

1106
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,959
At the end of a fairy tale.

1107
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,002
Yeah.

1108
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:38,504
Exactly.
