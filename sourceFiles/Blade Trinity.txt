1
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,931
<i>In the movies, 
Dracula wears a cape,</i>

2
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:38,350
<i>and some old English guy
always manages to save the day</i>

3
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:41,020
<i>at the last minute
with crosses and holy water.</i>

4
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:44,690
<i>But everybody knows
the movies are full of shit.</i>

5
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:50,571
<i>The truth is it started with Blade,
and it ended with him.</i>

6
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:53,115
<i>The rest of us
were just along for the ride.</i>

7
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:03,870
What's this chicken scratch?

8
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:06,331
It's cuneiform.

9
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:08,792
It's about 4,000 years old.

10
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:10,585
So why here?

11
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:13,588
Because this is the cradle 
of civilization.

12
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,634
He would've been comfortable here.

13
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:20,178
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.

14
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:21,513
There's something beneath us.

15
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,515
You find a watch?

16
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:27,936
Is it a body?

17
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:33,400
Guys?

18
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:38,905
Aah!

19
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:43,368
Go! Aah!

20
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:45,287
What the fuck?!

21
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:57,507
Aah!

22
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:17,272
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.

23
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:18,732
Got it. Heading westbound.

24
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,691
I'm just beneath ya.

25
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:21,192
Go!

26
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:39,414
I got him. Pull!

27
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:41,708
You all right, man?

28
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:00,852
He's got a gun!

29
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,327
Oh, my God!

30
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:29,881
Ouch.

31
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,636
Staked you with silver.

32
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,555
Why aren't you ash?

33
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,808
Why aren't you smarter?

34
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,395
Not a vampire, dumb shit!

35
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,944
Set your sorry ass up.

36
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:11,047
Damn.

37
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:40,493
Oh, Blade.

38
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:19,616
What the fuck happen tonight?

39
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:23,870
How should I know?

40
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:26,373
He was human.

41
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:28,500
You're gettin' reckless, Blade.

42
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,377
Killing vampires is clean.

43
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,214
They ash- don't leave
any evidence behind.

44
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:35,840
Killing humans is messy.

45
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:37,842
You better hope nobody ID'd you.

46
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:40,845
This worked really good.

47
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:46,184
What's this?

48
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,603
A new delivery system 
for your serum.

49
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,647
It's an effervescent inhaler.

50
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,566
Just bite down on the mouth guard.

51
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,734
Delivery's automatic.

52
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:56,403
Some friends of mine made it.

53
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,613
Friends?

54
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:01,491
Yeah.
You remember those?

55
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,034
<i>It was horrible.</i>

56
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:06,538
<i>The one car crashed, and then the guy
in the coat was shooting the other guy.</i>

57
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:08,957
<i>- It looked like there was a lot of blood.
- Thank you.</i>

58
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:11,251
<i>That was just a taste
of the mayhem that occurred</i>

59
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,044
<i>during tonight's 
brazen shootout</i>

60
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:15,338
<i>that left at least four 
people dead.</i>

61
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,299
<i>Now, apparently, 
an anonymous citizen</i>

62
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:19,175
<i>captured the whole event on video.</i>

63
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,052
Hey, Ray.
Hey, we got a lead.

64
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:22,596
Let's catch a plane, Wilson.

65
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:24,347
It's time to take these cowboys down.

66
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:25,974
That's what I'm talkin' about.

67
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,426
What's he been doing?

68
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,219
Fuck all. Just feeding.

69
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:04,888
Been through five of them so far.

70
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,514
Do you think we have enough security?

71
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:09,809
We didn't capture him.
He allowed us to take him in.

72
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:10,894
You understand?

73
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:12,395
I'm gonna go in.

74
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:24,009
You shouldn't have woken me.

75
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,136
We had to.

76
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:35,270
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.

77
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,690
What makes you think I care?

78
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:40,108
Your people need you.

79
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:41,526
My people?

80
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:48,700
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.

81
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:51,077
Look how far you have fallen.

82
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:53,330
The world's changed since your time.

83
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,248
The humans have a new hunter.

84
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,209
Blade.

85
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:01,379
And you'd like me
to kill him, wouldn't you?

86
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:03,632
Yes.

87
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:32,577
Subject is heading west.

88
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:34,788
Got him.

89
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:41,419
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist

90
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:47,259
<i>and author of the New York Times
bestseller Human Health,</i>

91
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:49,511
<i>The Whole Being Breakthrough.</i>

92
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:53,598
Also with us, Martin Vreede,
Chief of Police.

93
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:57,435
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls,

94
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,939
<i>next on Bently Tittle Live.</i>

95
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:03,448
Ok
Chief Vreede.

96
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:07,404
What's your take on all these rumors
we've been hearing about vampires?

97
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:11,741
If vampires existed, don't you think
we would've found them by now?

98
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,705
They should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.

99
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,504
Now, that's the guy 
I wanna hear about.

100
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:20,333
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?

101
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,211
He's a sociopath
that we've been pursuing.

102
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:27,132
Blade is a troubled individual.

103
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,801
I understand that he is
under the impression

104
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,262
that there is a vast conspiracy
of vampires.

105
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:37,726
Now, you've got to look
at the psychiatric underpinnings

106
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:43,398
Congratulations.
You're famous.

107
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:44,941
Somebody nailed us.

108
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,611
Your face is all over the papers
and television.

109
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:49,446
Media's eatin' it up.

110
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,197
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.

111
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:55,076
Something like this-
taking out a human-

112
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:57,787
as far as the rest
of the world is concerned,

113
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:00,081
you're public enemy number one.

114
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:03,084
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.

115
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,796
Damn it, Blade.
Don't you see what they're doing?

116
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,966
They're waging
a goddamn P.R. Campaign.

117
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,261
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about,

118
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:16,473
we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world, too.

119
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:21,436
You worry too much, old man.

120
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,772
That's why we're still alive, 
goddamn it.

121
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:27,359
I've been doing this
since before you were born, Blade.

122
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,152
You're like a son to me.

123
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:32,030
I'm sorry I got old on ya.

124
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:35,283
I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.

125
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,285
And it breaks my heart.

126
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,789
We can't win this war alone.

127
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,460
Oh, got it! Got it!

128
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:47,427
Baby on board.

129
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:51,299
Oh! Looks like we got ourselves
a combo meal!

130
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:08,233
Chicky, chicky, chicky, 
chicky, chicky!

131
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:58,783
Oh, yeah, baby!

132
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,702
What's for dinner?

133
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:13,840
Aah!

134
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,717
Hey, pretty lady.

135
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:25,477
No! No!

136
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:27,812
No!

137
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:33,151
Scream if this hurts, chica.

138
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:38,073
Aah!

139
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:39,991
Fuck you?

140
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:42,869
Aah!

141
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:44,579
Garlic!

142
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,060
<i>Scream if this hurts, chica.</i>

143
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:54,190
Aah!

144
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:58,797
What is it?

145
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:01,716
What you were worried about.

146
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,485
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

147
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,241
<i>Shoot to kill!</i>

148
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:05,238
Aah!

149
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:01,670
Move a finger and you're dead.

150
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,463
How's about this one?

151
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:04,923
He's got something in his hand!

152
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:06,424
Get out, Blade!

153
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:13,098
Shit!

154
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:30,824
What's going on in there?

155
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:32,284
Somebody talk to me!

156
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:40,333
Aah!

157
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,876
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

158
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:31,384
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

159
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:39,684
Special Agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale, FBI.

160
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:42,312
- We've been tracking you a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

161
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:44,439
Whistler.

162
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:45,732
Dead.

163
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:49,319
Just like all your victims.

164
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:52,739
Say, how many people
have you killed, Blade?

165
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:55,158
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?

166
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:58,703
1,182.

167
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:01,998
But they were all familiars.

168
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:04,084
People who work with them.

169
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:08,004
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?

170
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:15,887
You can keep doing your song
and dance as long as you want, Blade.

171
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,472
It's not gonna play.

172
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,975
We know what you are.

173
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:21,810
You're a stone-cold killer.

174
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:23,562
And you're sick as fuck.

175
00:26:23,603 --> 00:26:26,189
Let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.

176
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:29,109
Hello, Blade.

177
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:30,986
My name is Dr. Vance.

178
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:34,864
I've been charged with giving you
a psychiatric evaluation.

179
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:39,202
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?

180
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:41,121
He's all yours.

181
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:55,594
I know you must find this
very frightening...

182
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:59,264
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

183
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,100
And in order for me to do that,

184
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:06,396
I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

185
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,315
Do you know what day it is?

186
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:16,573
<i>How about the President?
You know who that is.</i>

187
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,073
An asshole.

188
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:27,375
<i>But I want to hear you
talk about vampires.</i>

189
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:29,377
What can you tell me about them?

190
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:33,465
They exist.

191
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,134
Are you one of them?

192
00:27:39,763 --> 00:27:41,723
Tell me about blood.

193
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:43,725
When you drink blood,

194
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:46,728
do you ever feel sexually aroused?

195
00:27:51,107 --> 00:27:55,237
Just strikes me
that this business of vampirism

196
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,949
has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.

197
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:11,002
And I'm wondering what your
relationship with your mother was like.

198
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:11,037
A nocturnal visit.

199
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:15,382
Were the two of you very close?

200
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:25,225
He's psychotic.

201
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:26,309
No shit.

202
00:28:26,351 --> 00:28:27,519
For his safety and for the public's,

203
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:29,896
I'm recommending that he be transferred
immediately to County Psychiatric-

204
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:31,731
Fuck that!
That man is my prisoner.

205
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:34,067
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of federal crimes.

206
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,403
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.

207
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:38,905
You got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.

208
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:40,907
- That man is my prisoner!
- The call has already been made.

209
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:42,200
Don't fuck with my thing!

210
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:45,036
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.

211
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:47,038
You're supposed to be
working with us on this, Chief.

212
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:48,081
Not this time.

213
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:57,257
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.

214
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:02,429
The usual dose for this sort of thing
is two, three hundred milligrams,

215
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:07,517
but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself,

216
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:10,103
I'll kick it up to a 
couple thousand.

217
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:12,647
You don't have a problem
with needles, do ya?

218
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,484
There.

219
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,028
That wasn't so bad, was it?

220
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:22,115
Ooh, you're weak.

221
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:24,701
In need of your serum.

222
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:27,454
That must be a bad feeling.

223
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:31,416
I mean, who would've imagined

224
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:34,586
that a mere human like me
could overpower you.

225
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:39,299
You're one of them.

226
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:42,344
A familiar.

227
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:48,475
Going on five years now.

228
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:54,189
It's the endgame, Blade.

229
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:57,275
All their plans are 
coming to fruition.

230
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:01,947
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?

231
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:13,166
I hate familiars.

232
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:25,595
<i>It's why we're still alive, 
goddamn it.</i>

233
00:30:25,845 --> 00:30:28,139
<i>You're like a son to me.</i>

234
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:34,729
<i>Sorry I got old on ya.</i>

235
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:40,318
<i>I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.</i>

236
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:42,362
<i>It breaks my heart.</i>

237
00:31:08,722 --> 00:31:10,015
Hi, Blade.

238
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:11,892
So glad to finally meet you.

239
00:31:11,975 --> 00:31:13,935
I am such a fan.

240
00:31:15,145 --> 00:31:17,272
I like your tattoos.

241
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:19,733
Do they mean anything?

242
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:22,152
Stupid.

243
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,529
Are you okay?

244
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:26,323
Are you tired?

245
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:29,409
You're weak.

246
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,249
We moved the humans around.

247
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,543
Like pawns.

248
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:41,087
We used them...

249
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,506
...to flush you out.

250
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:54,226
You're not so big.

251
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:58,313
You're all alone, Blade.

252
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:01,441
No one's gonna help you now.

253
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:25,173
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!

254
00:32:29,177 --> 00:32:30,679
Wake up, Blade.
This is your rescue.

255
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:20,520
Go!

256
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:09,444
Freeze!

257
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,751
Whistler!

258
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:27,337
This way!

259
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,097
Blade!

260
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:38,682
You're dead!

261
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:40,559
Get down!

262
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:48,984
Blade.

263
00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:57,867
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

264
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:58,952
Where are you going?

265
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:00,745
Where the fuck is he going?

266
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,039
This is supposed to be a rescue!

267
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:10,422
Get back, get back!

268
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:14,676
We're pinned down.

269
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:15,927
I can't shoot around corners.

270
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:17,053
<i>I can.</i>

271
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:57,969
Aah!

272
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:22,827
Okay. We're fucked.

273
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:24,037
We're fine.

274
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:39,010
Forgot my sword.

275
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:49,521
Whoo! Come on!

276
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,495
Abby.

277
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,958
Aah!

278
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,670
We got him.

279
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:15,380
We'll be there soon.

280
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:17,215
Who the hell are you people?

281
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:20,093
Well, my name is Hannibal King.

282
00:37:20,176 --> 00:37:22,512
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.

283
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:24,389
Whistler's daughter.

284
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:39,696
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.

285
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:43,325
They did.
I was born later out of wedlock.

286
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,662
When I came of age,
I tracked my dad down,

287
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:49,122
and I told him I wanted in.

288
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:51,708
Been doing it ever since.

289
00:37:58,423 --> 00:38:00,467
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

290
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:03,595
How do you bankroll 
this operation?

291
00:38:03,678 --> 00:38:05,180
I date a lot of older men.

292
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:08,558
Come on, man, I'm joking.

293
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,352
You met Dex.

294
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:11,728
This is Hedges.

295
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:14,689
Sommerfield- she's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.

296
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:19,945
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter Zoe.

297
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,823
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.

298
00:38:24,532 --> 00:38:27,953
Hmm. Sounds like rejects
from a Saturday morning cartoon.

299
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:31,831
We were gonna go with the Care Bears, 
but, uh, that was taken.

300
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:36,628
How many of you are there?

301
00:38:36,711 --> 00:38:37,837
There's enough.

302
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:39,548
We operate in sleeper cells.

303
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:42,050
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.

304
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:44,928
Consider us your reinforcements.

305
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:48,723
What, you amateurs
are supposed to be helping me?

306
00:38:50,892 --> 00:38:52,352
You?

307
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:54,729
Look at you.

308
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:56,106
You're kids.

309
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:58,525
You're not ready to 
roll with this.

310
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:01,111
I mean, look at the 
way you're dressed.

311
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:03,947
What, that's supposed to
be tactical?

312
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:06,992
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you."

313
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:08,451
It's a joke, huh?

314
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:11,580
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?

315
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:14,332
You think this is a 
fucking sitcom?

316
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:17,419
Okay, first off, that's just rude.

317
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:21,339
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.

318
00:39:23,884 --> 00:39:25,677
I'm impressed.

319
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:28,889
Look, Blade, my father meant
for us to help you.

320
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:31,892
Like it or not, 
we are all you got.

321
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:35,228
What the hell makes you think
you know about hunting vampires?

322
00:39:35,312 --> 00:39:39,024
Well, here's for starters.

323
00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:41,234
I used to be one.

324
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:44,070
Do I pass the audition?

325
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:47,240
Rookies.

326
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,452
Fucking Hannibal King!

327
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:54,247
I should've ripped his bleeding heart
out when I had the chance!

328
00:39:55,624 --> 00:39:56,958
Ugh!

329
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:00,128
Ugh!

330
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:03,798
We had Blade.

331
00:40:03,882 --> 00:40:05,258
We had him!

332
00:40:05,342 --> 00:40:06,635
Ugh!

333
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,180
And don't tell me 
"I told you so," Asher.

334
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:12,182
What's wrong, half pint?
You need a time out?

335
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:13,475
Blow me.

336
00:40:14,893 --> 00:40:17,062
We got caught with our 
pants down.

337
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:18,521
Pants down?

338
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:21,775
They pretty much
fucking ass-raped us.

339
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:23,276
Oh, you loved it.

340
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,986
Has he been told?

341
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:27,656
About your failure?

342
00:40:28,865 --> 00:40:29,866
Yes.

343
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,870
Maybe it's time I joined the game.

344
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:44,172
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?

345
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:47,968
You see her and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off,

346
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:52,097
but you still manage to ask
for her number.

347
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,140
Well, that's all I ever 
hook up with.

348
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:55,976
<i>But this betty...</i>

349
00:40:56,935 --> 00:41:01,273
Whoa! She blew 'em all away
in the shitstorm sweepstakes.

350
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:03,525
Her name is Danica Talos.

351
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:05,151
You met her earlier.

352
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:08,780
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.

353
00:41:11,575 --> 00:41:13,159
Moving on.

354
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:16,162
The man on her left
is her brother Asher,

355
00:41:16,246 --> 00:41:19,749
and this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.

356
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,501
I picked Danica up in a bar

357
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:23,753
and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck

358
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:26,339
as her little vampire cabana boy.

359
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:28,925
Eventually, Abigail found me.

360
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:32,596
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.

361
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,100
And that's basically
turning a frown upside-down.

362
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:41,146
We need to pool our resources, Blade.

363
00:41:42,022 --> 00:41:43,148
"We"?

364
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,568
Yeah, we.

365
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,195
He's come back.

366
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:53,199
Take a look at this.

367
00:41:58,413 --> 00:41:59,831
You gotta be kidding me.

368
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:05,260
He is real.
BLADE BABA

369
00:42:05,295 --> 00:42:06,504
This is a piece of his armor.

370
00:42:06,588 --> 00:42:10,050
With it, we were able to extrapolate a
basic idea of what this fucker looked like.

371
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:11,384
Check this out.

372
00:42:12,552 --> 00:42:15,096
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.

373
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:19,434
The Babylonians worshipped him
as Dagon, and now they call him Drake.

374
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:22,896
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.

375
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:35,450
Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this.

376
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:41,039
He was the first of his kind.

377
00:42:42,082 --> 00:42:45,710
<i>The patriarch of 
hominus nocturna.</i>

378
00:42:51,132 --> 00:42:53,635
He was born perfect.

379
00:42:56,596 --> 00:43:01,560
And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.

380
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:03,770
Forget the movies, 
forget the books.

381
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:05,522
There's no happy ending 
with this guy.

382
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:10,360
He's been there,
moving behind the scenes,

383
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:14,864
cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...

384
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:18,451
...just like that...

385
00:43:22,163 --> 00:43:24,457
...he up and disappeared.

386
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:26,209
And then we heard a rumor.

387
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,420
The vampires were searching for him.

388
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:30,964
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages,

389
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:34,134
that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.

390
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:38,471
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.

391
00:43:38,513 --> 00:43:40,348
And he was pissed.

392
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,627
Don't try to use my name,
that's fatal

393
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:11,338
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

394
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:14,591
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

395
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:17,594
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

396
00:44:17,677 --> 00:44:20,472
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

397
00:44:20,555 --> 00:44:24,059
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

398
00:44:37,572 --> 00:44:39,866
In the window...

399
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:42,285
You sell vampire merchandise?

400
00:44:44,621 --> 00:44:45,872
Uh, yeah.

401
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:47,332
Look around.

402
00:44:47,415 --> 00:44:49,084
We might have a few things.

403
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:53,713
We've got Dracula lunchboxes.

404
00:44:53,797 --> 00:44:55,131
Did you see those?

405
00:44:55,215 --> 00:44:58,843
There's bobble heads, key chains.

406
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:02,055
We've got just about anything.

407
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:04,975
Even vampire vibrators.

408
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,648
Was there something special
you needed?

409
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:14,609
Hey, guy.

410
00:45:15,527 --> 00:45:16,987
She's talkin' to ya.

411
00:45:24,744 --> 00:45:26,288
What?

412
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:28,290
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?

413
00:45:28,373 --> 00:45:30,876
Aah!

414
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:32,085
No!

415
00:45:32,168 --> 00:45:34,296
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

416
00:45:34,337 --> 00:45:37,591
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

417
00:45:37,674 --> 00:45:39,926
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

418
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:45,140
Aah!

419
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:48,602
Aah!

420
00:45:55,984 --> 00:45:59,404
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

421
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:01,197
Why wake up Drake now?

422
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:03,366
That's exactly what we've been
trying to figure out.

423
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,701
When I was under the fang,

424
00:46:04,784 --> 00:46:08,830
there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.

425
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:10,874
But I could never figure out why
they'd want to destroy their food source.

426
00:46:10,957 --> 00:46:12,959
I mean, that makes no sense, right?

427
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:14,586
They've always had plans
for the human race,

428
00:46:14,669 --> 00:46:17,172
and it seems likely
that whatever they're cooking up,

429
00:46:17,214 --> 00:46:19,049
Drake's return is part of it.

430
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:20,091
Let's face it.

431
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:22,302
We are fighting a losing battle here.

432
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:24,888
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year- big deal.

433
00:46:24,971 --> 00:46:27,933
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.

434
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:29,226
We need a new tactic.

435
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:30,477
Like what?

436
00:46:30,602 --> 00:46:32,062
A biological weapon.

437
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:35,232
For you sighted people...

438
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:39,986
...here's a little show and tell.

439
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,614
For the last year,
I've been working with synthesized DNA

440
00:46:42,697 --> 00:46:46,660
in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.

441
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:48,828
We're calling it DayStar.

442
00:46:48,912 --> 00:46:50,538
Think about it, Blade.

443
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:53,750
We could wipe 'em all out
in one single move.

444
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,585
So what's been holding you back?

445
00:46:55,627 --> 00:46:58,004
The lethality in vampires 
is still spotty.

446
00:46:58,088 --> 00:47:01,216
The bottom line is we need
a better strand of DNA to work with.

447
00:47:02,092 --> 00:47:04,135
We need Dracula's blood.

448
00:47:04,177 --> 00:47:06,805
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race,

449
00:47:06,888 --> 00:47:09,272
his DNA is still pure.

450
00:47:09,307 --> 00:47:13,979
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.

451
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:19,859
We get his blood, we can boost
DayStar's viral efficacy to 100%.

452
00:47:19,943 --> 00:47:22,112
All the vampires go bye-bye.

453
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:26,324
So, can we just
go right ahead and sign you up

454
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:28,660
for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?

455
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,584
Oh.

456
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,043
Holy shit.

457
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:39,838
Um, gentlemen and hottie,

458
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:42,716
uh, we have a wide assortment
of ass-kickery

459
00:47:42,799 --> 00:47:44,801
for your viewing pleasure today.

460
00:47:44,926 --> 00:47:48,638
Electronic pistol- comes in a variety
of tasty calibers.

461
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,057
Explosive rounds.

462
00:47:51,141 --> 00:47:53,268
Yeah, but with
a concentrated burst of UV light

463
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:55,312
instead of your standard 
hollow points.

464
00:47:55,395 --> 00:47:57,147
I call 'em sun dogs.

465
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,442
Hedges. Super-size me, sweetheart.

466
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:05,322
This little pea shooter-
it's a modified version

467
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:08,116
of the Army's objective
individual combat weapon.

468
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:09,910
Pick your poison- sun dogs, stakes,

469
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:11,536
heat-seeking mini rockets.

470
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,956
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy'll pump 'em out.

471
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,001
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...

472
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,795
Oh, God.

473
00:48:20,879 --> 00:48:23,298
Over here, we, um-

474
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:27,093
we call this the UV Arc.

475
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,304
Whoa. Sorry.

476
00:48:29,387 --> 00:48:32,265
The two points are connected
by a powerful UV laser-

477
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:34,351
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.

478
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:37,604
This bad boy is half as 
hot as the sun.

479
00:48:37,646 --> 00:48:41,024
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.

480
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:44,402
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.

481
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:46,821
Turning into mist?
Kinda doubt it.

482
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:50,408
General shape-shifting?
Maybe.

483
00:48:51,117 --> 00:48:53,703
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that,

484
00:48:53,787 --> 00:48:57,749
but another human,
with practice, could be possible.

485
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:01,253
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.

486
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:04,631
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones-

487
00:49:04,714 --> 00:49:08,176
I have a- I have a question
about that, Hedges.

488
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,136
Have you ever been laid?

489
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:12,681
Many times.

490
00:49:12,764 --> 00:49:13,848
With ladies.

491
00:49:15,767 --> 00:49:17,352
Time for a little pressure.

492
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:20,730
The weakest link
in the vampire chain of command

493
00:49:20,772 --> 00:49:22,899
has always been their familiars.

494
00:49:22,983 --> 00:49:25,235
Since the vampires can't go out
in the daylight,

495
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:28,113
they get the humans to do
all their dirty work.

496
00:49:28,196 --> 00:49:30,115
We bleed the wannabes...

497
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:33,034
Sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.

498
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:35,287
I got you some new wheels.

499
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,830
You take care of it now.

500
00:49:43,003 --> 00:49:44,379
She's making playlists.

501
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:47,299
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.

502
00:49:47,424 --> 00:49:49,801
It's like her own
internal soundtrack, you know?

503
00:49:49,885 --> 00:49:53,930
Dark core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.

504
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:57,475
Me, I'm more of
a David Hasselhoff fan, you know?

505
00:49:59,352 --> 00:50:01,563
Come on, come on
like that, ya'll

506
00:50:03,607 --> 00:50:05,734
Come on, come on,
like that, y'all

507
00:50:06,776 --> 00:50:08,778
Let me see you say ho

508
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:32,761
Let me see you say ho

509
00:50:37,682 --> 00:50:41,561
Aah!

510
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:47,400
Ah! Aah!

511
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:55,700
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.

512
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:58,078
Fuck! No, no!
Please, please! Please.

513
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,371
Who's your handler?

514
00:50:59,454 --> 00:51:00,997
I don't know my fucking handler.

515
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:02,874
I swear. I swear!

516
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,126
Oh, shit! Please! Please!

517
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:11,424
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

518
00:51:12,175 --> 00:51:13,260
I'll take that.

519
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:15,095
Come on!

520
00:51:15,178 --> 00:51:16,680
Let's go! Come on!

521
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:23,144
<i>Hello?</i>

522
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:27,190
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.

523
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:29,651
It's for you.

524
00:51:29,734 --> 00:51:31,111
Yeah, go ahead.

525
00:51:31,695 --> 00:51:33,363
Hello?

526
00:51:33,446 --> 00:51:35,824
Aah!

527
00:51:36,616 --> 00:51:38,368
You know, at some point, you, uh,

528
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:40,787
you might want to consider
sitting down with somebody.

529
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,831
You know? Have a little share time?

530
00:51:42,873 --> 00:51:45,250
Kick back? Get in touch 
with your inner child?

531
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,334
That sort of thing?

532
00:51:46,418 --> 00:51:50,964
Also- just a thought- but you might
wanna consider blinking once in a while.

533
00:51:55,969 --> 00:52:00,015
I'm sorry, I, uh,
I ate a lot of sugar today.

534
00:52:17,365 --> 00:52:18,366
Hey.

535
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,702
You just can't walk in 
here like- aah!

536
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,669
Excuse me, sir.

537
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:38,178
Don't do that.

538
00:52:56,029 --> 00:52:57,030
Where's Vance?

539
00:52:57,113 --> 00:52:59,199
I'm sorry, but you can't see
Dr. Vance right now.

540
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:09,584
Sit.

541
00:53:14,464 --> 00:53:15,799
Can I, uh, can I help you?

542
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,009
Remember me?
Time for payback.

543
00:53:18,093 --> 00:53:20,428
All right, Vance,
what the hell do you know?

544
00:53:23,098 --> 00:53:24,182
Oh, Jesus.

545
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:25,433
It's him.

546
00:53:25,517 --> 00:53:27,227
Abby. It's Drake!

547
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:35,610
Aah!

548
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:45,537
So, you're the hunter 
they all fear.

549
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,080
I had a feeling about you.

550
00:53:47,163 --> 00:53:48,415
Just shoot him!

551
00:53:48,498 --> 00:53:50,083
Go ahead, Blade.

552
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:51,501
Show me what you're made of.

553
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:52,627
Aah!

554
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:24,344
Aah! Oh, my God!

555
00:55:24,427 --> 00:55:26,555
He got my baby!

556
00:55:26,638 --> 00:55:29,474
Aah! No! My baby!

557
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:31,328
Ah, careful, Daywalker.

558
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:33,371
I've been told about you.

559
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:35,498
Your weakness for humans.

560
00:56:35,582 --> 00:56:37,125
Why'd you kill Vance?

561
00:56:37,209 --> 00:56:39,461
He'd outlived his purpose.

562
00:56:40,003 --> 00:56:41,087
He died a good death.

563
00:56:41,421 --> 00:56:43,131
Quick, clean.

564
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:45,217
I wouldn't know anything 
about that.

565
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,676
You will.

566
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:51,139
How are you able to 
survive in sunlight?

567
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:53,475
Haven't you read Stoker's fable?

568
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:57,229
I was the first of the vampires.

569
00:56:58,647 --> 00:57:00,440
I am unique.

570
00:57:00,523 --> 00:57:01,983
So that's why they 
brought you back.

571
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:03,443
Of course.

572
00:57:03,526 --> 00:57:06,613
They believe through me
they could become Daywalkers.

573
00:57:12,118 --> 00:57:13,620
Look at them down there.

574
00:57:13,703 --> 00:57:16,540
Scurrying around like insects.

575
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:20,794
They don't know anything about honor
or living by the sword,

576
00:57:20,877 --> 00:57:22,504
not like you and I do.

577
00:57:23,046 --> 00:57:26,550
Do you think they could ever grasp
what it means to be immortal?

578
00:57:26,675 --> 00:57:27,926
You're not immortal.

579
00:57:28,718 --> 00:57:32,305
I must've heard hundreds of you 
rodents make the same claim.

580
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:35,892
Each one of them have tasted
the end of my sword.

581
00:57:35,976 --> 00:57:37,936
Perhaps I will too, then,

582
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:41,648
but I think it is more likely
the next time we meet,

583
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:44,025
<i>you fall before mine.</i>

584
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:46,111
Catch!

585
00:58:05,005 --> 00:58:06,423
Cootchie coo.

586
00:58:08,425 --> 00:58:09,509
Did you see that guy?

587
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:11,136
We're gonna lose, man.
We're gonna-

588
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:13,471
Oh! God!

589
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:15,473
We're gonna fucking lose!

590
00:58:15,932 --> 00:58:16,975
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

591
00:58:17,183 --> 00:58:18,852
What are you- what is that?
What are you doing?

592
00:58:18,887 --> 00:58:20,353
It's an elastic protein, okay?

593
00:58:20,437 --> 00:58:21,897
It's gonna stop the hemorrhaging.

594
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,064
Okay.

595
00:58:23,148 --> 00:58:24,274
Is it gonna hurt?

596
00:58:24,357 --> 00:58:26,192
Yeah, it's gonna sting a little.

597
00:58:26,234 --> 00:58:27,736
Really?

598
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,032
Fuck me!

599
00:58:32,115 --> 00:58:33,283
Aah!

600
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,955
<i>I had a family once.</i>

601
00:58:39,706 --> 00:58:42,083
<i>Wife, two daughters.</i>

602
00:58:46,463 --> 00:58:49,049
<i>Then a drifter came calling
one evening.</i>

603
00:58:50,383 --> 00:58:51,635
<i>A vampire.</i>

604
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:55,263
<i>He toyed with 'em first.</i>

605
00:58:57,182 --> 00:59:01,144
<i>Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.</i>

606
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:04,689
<i>I've been doing this a long time.</i>

607
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:07,025
<i>Since before you were born.</i>

608
00:59:08,151 --> 00:59:10,528
<i>I don't want this 
life for you, Abby.</i>

609
00:59:53,488 --> 00:59:54,781
Hey, Blade.

610
00:59:54,864 --> 00:59:57,534
I got a question for you.

611
00:59:57,617 --> 01:00:00,203
Say we're successful.
Say we wipe out all the vampires.

612
01:00:00,287 --> 01:00:01,872
What then, huh?

613
01:00:02,622 --> 01:00:04,541
You ever ask yourself that?

614
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:06,751
I mean, somehow,

615
01:00:06,835 --> 01:00:12,132
I- I don't picture you teaching karate
at the local Y.

616
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:24,561
He hates me, doesn't he?

617
01:00:24,644 --> 01:00:25,937
Yeah.

618
01:00:40,827 --> 01:00:42,245
Why do you do that?

619
01:00:43,038 --> 01:00:47,334
Because there's something bad
inside of me.

620
01:00:48,877 --> 01:00:50,837
This keeps it from getting out.

621
01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:53,006
Why can't you just be nice?

622
01:00:58,637 --> 01:01:00,972
Because the world isn't nice.

623
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,271
I found where the vampires 
are working.

624
01:01:08,605 --> 01:01:10,774
Biomedica Enterprises.

625
01:01:10,857 --> 01:01:13,652
They've been buying up
all sorts of supplies.

626
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:15,278
Check it out.

627
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:18,031
Taq polymerase,

628
01:01:18,114 --> 01:01:20,992
bone marrow growth supplement,

629
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:24,037
genetic sequencing enzymes.

630
01:01:25,205 --> 01:01:26,790
You want a party favor?

631
01:01:26,873 --> 01:01:28,416
Lucky seven.

632
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,126
Silver hollow points.

633
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:31,711
Done.

634
01:02:01,283 --> 01:02:02,576
You wanted to see me?

635
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:04,786
We've got trouble.

636
01:02:05,328 --> 01:02:07,622
Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?

637
01:02:07,664 --> 01:02:09,165
Shit!

638
01:02:20,886 --> 01:02:22,345
What are you doing here?

639
01:02:22,929 --> 01:02:23,972
Talk.

640
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,683
Talk.

641
01:02:30,395 --> 01:02:31,771
Spill it!

642
01:02:31,855 --> 01:02:33,064
You know what we're doing.

643
01:02:33,815 --> 01:02:35,233
What's inside?

644
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:38,653
Aah!

645
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:45,785
Now, what's behind door number one?

646
01:02:47,787 --> 01:02:49,831
I can't tell you.
They- they'll kill me.

647
01:02:49,915 --> 01:02:52,042
<i>Kill you?
Motherfucker, I'll kill you.</i>

648
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,627
I'll just enjoy it better.

649
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:03,511
You know the routine.

650
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:21,738
Lights.

651
01:03:24,908 --> 01:03:26,034
God in Heaven.

652
01:03:42,008 --> 01:03:43,677
What is this place?

653
01:03:44,636 --> 01:03:46,680
It's a blood farming facility.

654
01:03:52,852 --> 01:03:56,982
Vampires decided that hunting humans
on a piecemeal basis was...

655
01:03:57,023 --> 01:03:58,358
too inefficient.

656
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,320
Why kill your prey
when you can keep them alive?

657
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:07,576
Under optimal conditions,
a donor can generate

658
01:04:07,617 --> 01:04:10,412
anywhere from 50 to 100
pints of blood.

659
01:04:11,037 --> 01:04:12,706
Productive.

660
01:04:14,457 --> 01:04:16,042
Where do you get all these people?

661
01:04:17,711 --> 01:04:20,630
They got processing centers
in every major city.

662
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:22,883
At any given time, there's what,

663
01:04:22,966 --> 01:04:26,678
two, three million homeless
wandering around America?

664
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:28,638
They just pull 'em in off the streets.

665
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,434
Nobody cares about them.

666
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,062
We're doing this country
a service, really.

667
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,192
Vampire final solution.

668
01:04:42,193 --> 01:04:44,237
Are they aware?

669
01:04:44,321 --> 01:04:46,281
Do they feel anything?

670
01:04:47,032 --> 01:04:49,242
They're in a chemical-induced coma.

671
01:04:49,326 --> 01:04:50,869
They're brain dead.

672
01:04:54,664 --> 01:04:56,082
Look at this.

673
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,460
This the future you want?

674
01:04:58,543 --> 01:05:02,923
<i>Don't you think that they have
a place for you in their future?</i>

675
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:05,300
We don't have a choice!

676
01:05:06,301 --> 01:05:08,803
They're going to win.
Can't you see that?

677
01:05:09,346 --> 01:05:10,555
He's come back!

678
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:12,891
There's nothing stopping them now.

679
01:05:12,974 --> 01:05:14,476
There's me.

680
01:05:15,644 --> 01:05:16,895
Go!

681
01:05:18,146 --> 01:05:20,315
You got 20 seconds.

682
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:24,569
Twenty.

683
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:33,495
Shutdown password- what is it?

684
01:05:33,578 --> 01:05:35,288
Harvest.

685
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:37,457
Put it in.

686
01:05:53,515 --> 01:05:54,641
Let's go.

687
01:06:07,195 --> 01:06:10,156
Where'd you go?
See? I turned my back on you.

688
01:06:10,198 --> 01:06:12,909
- Oh! You win.
- One more, one more.

689
01:06:12,993 --> 01:06:16,746
"Now, Nome King,
having never tried to be good,

690
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,583
was very bad indeed."

691
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:23,545
"Having decided to conquer
the land of Oz

692
01:06:23,587 --> 01:06:27,215
and to destroy the Emerald City..."

693
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:35,640
This ain't no video game.

694
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:37,183
This ain't no video game.

695
01:06:41,229 --> 01:06:42,272
Come on, now.

696
01:07:08,048 --> 01:07:11,092
Dude, you're dead.

697
01:07:18,683 --> 01:07:21,019
Mom, the lights are weird.

698
01:07:22,604 --> 01:07:23,897
What do you mean?

699
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:25,482
They're going on and off.

700
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,612
Guys?

701
01:07:32,072 --> 01:07:35,242
Zoe, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide, okay?

702
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:37,869
Like we talked about. Go on.

703
01:10:15,402 --> 01:10:17,195
Something's not right.

704
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,981
Zoe?

705
01:11:38,109 --> 01:11:39,319
Whistler.

706
01:12:55,812 --> 01:12:57,355
Use it.

707
01:12:59,816 --> 01:13:01,109
Use it.

708
01:13:05,155 --> 01:13:07,282
Use it.

709
01:13:12,078 --> 01:13:14,956
Aah!

710
01:13:28,345 --> 01:13:30,013
Back off, pooch.

711
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:36,102
Jesus Christ!

712
01:13:37,562 --> 01:13:39,147
What the fuck?!

713
01:13:39,231 --> 01:13:40,523
Good dog.

714
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,151
What the fuck?!

715
01:13:46,363 --> 01:13:47,614
His name's Pac-Man.

716
01:13:48,698 --> 01:13:52,619
We've been porting the vampire gene
into other species- experimenting.

717
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:56,665
You made a goddamn
vampire Pomeranian?

718
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,292
Yeah.

719
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,841
Precious, isn't he?

720
01:14:06,925 --> 01:14:09,177
Well, that depends who you ask,
because clearly,

721
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:11,263
this dog has a bigger 
dick than you.

722
01:14:12,389 --> 01:14:16,434
And when the fuck
did you see my dick, fuckface?

723
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,354
Ow!

724
01:14:19,396 --> 01:14:22,023
<i>I was talking to her!</i>

725
01:14:25,777 --> 01:14:27,612
Poor King.

726
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:31,825
You look so distraught!

727
01:14:36,121 --> 01:14:37,622
Give me that chair.

728
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,925
You're tasting a little bland, 
lover.

729
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:51,970
Are you getting enough
fatty acids in your diet?

730
01:14:52,012 --> 01:14:54,973
Have you tried lake trout?

731
01:14:55,056 --> 01:14:56,766
Mackerel?

732
01:14:56,850 --> 01:15:00,228
How about you take
a sugar-frosted fuck

733
01:15:00,312 --> 01:15:02,397
off the end of my dick?

734
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:07,527
And how about everyone here
not saying the word "dick" anymore?

735
01:15:07,611 --> 01:15:10,363
It provokes my envy.

736
01:15:18,163 --> 01:15:20,081
Tell us about Blade, King.

737
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:22,834
What's this weapon
he's been planning?

738
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,462
I can tell you two things.

739
01:15:27,088 --> 01:15:33,053
One... your hairdo is ridiculous.

740
01:15:34,137 --> 01:15:39,434
Two, I ate a lot of garlic,
and I just farted.

741
01:15:39,476 --> 01:15:41,019
Silent but deadly.

742
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,856
Spit it out, 
you fucking fruitcake!

743
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,941
All right! Fuck!

744
01:15:46,024 --> 01:15:47,734
I'll tell you about the weapon.

745
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,661
It's a new flavor crystal formula.

746
01:15:57,702 --> 01:15:59,579
Twice the chocolaty goodness,
half the calories.

747
01:15:59,663 --> 01:16:01,456
Plus, it helps
prevent tooth decay. There.

748
01:16:11,049 --> 01:16:13,134
You're brave, King.

749
01:16:13,218 --> 01:16:14,678
I'll give you that.

750
01:16:15,762 --> 01:16:19,683
But underneath all that swagger,

751
01:16:19,766 --> 01:16:22,686
I know what you really fear.

752
01:16:23,186 --> 01:16:26,690
What would hurt you
more than anything else.

753
01:16:40,078 --> 01:16:44,958
You don't want to go back
to being one of us, do you?

754
01:16:53,341 --> 01:16:57,429
I'm gonna bite you again, King.

755
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:02,267
And I'm gonna leave you here
while you turn.

756
01:17:02,309 --> 01:17:06,104
I'm going to watch you 
day after day

757
01:17:06,146 --> 01:17:10,567
as the thirst
keeps building and building.

758
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:14,613
And then,

759
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:18,408
when you can't stand it anymore...

760
01:17:23,914 --> 01:17:26,666
...I'm gonna bring the 
little girl in here...

761
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:30,170
...for you to feed on.

762
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,299
Would you like that, King?

763
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:39,054
Would you enjoy taking her life?

764
01:17:55,111 --> 01:17:57,113
Now we're getting somewhere, 
my pet.

765
01:18:19,302 --> 01:18:20,595
Are you all right?

766
01:18:21,888 --> 01:18:23,890
Yeah. I'll be fine.

767
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:28,562
Don't let it turn inward.

768
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:33,942
I already has...

769
01:19:32,459 --> 01:19:33,752
He's one of ours.

770
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,337
My name is Caulder.

771
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,464
I'll be your driver this evening.

772
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:49,768
Sommerfield left you 
a video message.

773
01:19:53,813 --> 01:19:56,066
<i>If you're watching this,
I'm already dead.</i>

774
01:19:56,983 --> 01:20:01,655
<i>If Zoe's alive, I want you to promise me
that you'll take care of her, okay?</i>

775
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:04,407
<i>I've been reading her
the Oz books every night.</i>

776
01:20:05,617 --> 01:20:08,119
<i>We just started reading
The Emerald City of Oz.</i>

777
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,622
<i>You know, the one
with the Nome King?</i>

778
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:17,170
<i>I think I've managed to cultivate
a workable strain of the DayStar virus.</i>

779
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,382
<i>As a precaution, I transmitted
the genetic sequence to Caulder</i>

780
01:20:20,465 --> 01:20:22,634
<i>in case our main stock 
was destroyed.</i>

781
01:20:23,468 --> 01:20:25,554
<i>In order for it
to achieve maximum lethality,</i>

782
01:20:25,637 --> 01:20:27,931
<i>you're gonna need to interfuse it
with Drake's blood.</i>

783
01:20:28,807 --> 01:20:32,811
<i>Now, if it works, every 
vampire in the immediate vicinity</i>

784
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,396
<i>should die almost instantly.</i>

785
01:20:35,647 --> 01:20:37,148
<i>There's one other thing.</i>

786
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:40,485
<i>Blade, you need to know</i>

787
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:43,238
<i>that there's a chance
the virus could destroy you, too.</i>

788
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,531
<i>Because you're a hybrid,</i>

789
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:47,993
<i>l- I'm not sure if your immune system
will be able to tolerate it.</i>

790
01:20:49,202 --> 01:20:53,582
<i>I'm sorry. We just didn't have
enough time to properly test it.</i>

791
01:20:56,126 --> 01:20:59,754
So, shall we take a look
at the plague arrow?

792
01:21:00,839 --> 01:21:04,342
I only had time to fabricate
a small amount of DayStar.

793
01:21:05,218 --> 01:21:10,265
However, I was able to outfit it.

794
01:21:11,474 --> 01:21:13,643
A compressed gas projectile...

795
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:20,901
...that can be shot from one
of the four-barrel rifles or a bow.

796
01:21:23,403 --> 01:21:27,032
Either way, you must be sure
that the shot counts.

797
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:30,410
You would simply not have enough
for a second shot.

798
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,088
Do you know who I am?

799
01:21:42,589 --> 01:21:44,216
You're the Nome King.

800
01:21:45,717 --> 01:21:46,760
Ah.

801
01:21:46,885 --> 01:21:48,887
The Nome King.

802
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,931
How sweet.

803
01:21:51,014 --> 01:21:54,142
Tell me, child,
do you want to die?

804
01:21:54,226 --> 01:21:55,727
I'm not afraid.

805
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:57,312
I'll go to Heaven.

806
01:21:58,188 --> 01:21:59,397
There is no Heaven.

807
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:02,859
No God, no angels.

808
01:22:02,943 --> 01:22:06,196
The only thing in your future
is nothingness.

809
01:22:06,279 --> 01:22:08,573
But what if you could 
change that?

810
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:11,576
What if you could
remain a child forever?

811
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:13,954
Wouldn't you like that?

812
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,997
Wouldn't you accept that gift?

813
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,293
My friends are coming to kill you.

814
01:22:42,983 --> 01:22:45,110
This blood

815
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:56,371
Wake the night!

816
01:23:04,296 --> 01:23:06,715
It's gonna wake the night

817
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,139
It's gonna wake the night

818
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,974
Wake the night!

819
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:17,934
This blood

820
01:23:21,146 --> 01:23:22,397
This blood

821
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,900
It's gonna wake the night

822
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:27,110
This blood

823
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,905
This blood

824
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:32,616
It's gonna wake the night!

825
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:49,299
- This blood
- Wake the night!

826
01:23:56,556 --> 01:23:58,266
It's gonna wake the night

827
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:07,692
- This blood
- Wake the night!

828
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,118
Wake the night!

829
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:18,703
This blood

830
01:24:19,871 --> 01:24:22,165
This blood

831
01:24:22,207 --> 01:24:24,376
It's gonna wake the night!

832
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,929
Gonna be sorry you did that.

833
01:24:36,012 --> 01:24:37,013
Why?

834
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:41,810
Nobody's coming for you, Kingshit.

835
01:24:43,937 --> 01:24:44,938
Sure they are.

836
01:24:45,855 --> 01:24:46,856
God-

837
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:52,487
See, one of the things you fuckheads
need to know about us Nightstalkers

838
01:24:52,529 --> 01:24:57,909
is that when you join our club, you get
all sorts of groovy little door prizes.

839
01:24:57,993 --> 01:25:02,747
And one of them is this nifty little tracking
node surgically implanted in your body.

840
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:05,959
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

841
01:25:09,254 --> 01:25:11,381
See, when one of us goes missing...

842
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:15,427
...the others,
they just dial up the satellite

843
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,220
which is in space.

844
01:25:17,262 --> 01:25:18,930
And then presto.

845
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:21,641
Instant cavalry.

846
01:25:22,642 --> 01:25:23,977
You like that, huh?

847
01:25:25,312 --> 01:25:26,646
Go fuck your sister.

848
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,648
Okay, King.

849
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:33,361
Where is this tracking 
node of yours?

850
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,947
It's in my left ass check.

851
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:38,658
Fine.

852
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,452
It's in my right ass cheek.

853
01:25:42,204 --> 01:25:44,331
Okay, I'm- okay, seriously, now.

854
01:25:45,457 --> 01:25:48,877
It's in the meat of my butt,
just below the Hello Kitty tattoo.

855
01:25:52,464 --> 01:25:55,383
Seriously, just pull down
my tighty-whities and see for yourself.

856
01:25:55,425 --> 01:25:56,426
Enough!

857
01:25:56,509 --> 01:25:58,220
It's not funny anymore!

858
01:25:58,303 --> 01:26:00,889
No, it's not,
you horse-humping bitch!

859
01:26:00,931 --> 01:26:03,391
But it will be a few seconds from now.

860
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:07,646
See, that tickle that you're feeling
in the back of your throat right now...

861
01:26:09,147 --> 01:26:11,816
...that's atomized colloidal silver.

862
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,486
It's being pumped through
the building's air conditioning system,

863
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:17,322
you cock-juggling thundercunt!

864
01:26:26,373 --> 01:26:29,543
Which means the fat lady
should be singing

865
01:26:29,626 --> 01:26:33,296
right about now!

866
01:26:41,471 --> 01:26:43,098
This is awkward.

867
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,685
Do you have a cell phone?

868
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:14,379
Um... a little help here.

869
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:58,882
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

870
01:27:58,924 --> 01:28:00,425
- Where's Zoe?
- Drake's got her.

871
01:28:00,467 --> 01:28:01,843
Okay.

872
01:28:05,764 --> 01:28:06,848
Thank you.

873
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:09,684
I brought your toys.

874
01:28:10,602 --> 01:28:12,020
Try to keep up.

875
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:32,541
Aah!

876
01:30:20,273 --> 01:30:21,650
Abby!

877
01:30:21,775 --> 01:30:22,776
Hey.

878
01:30:24,277 --> 01:30:25,904
You okay?

879
01:30:25,946 --> 01:30:28,031
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

880
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:29,366
Watch out!

881
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:52,180
Fuck me.

882
01:30:54,975 --> 01:30:57,811
Oh, fuck me sideways!

883
01:31:01,731 --> 01:31:02,816
Oh, yeah.

884
01:31:03,441 --> 01:31:05,735
He's a cute little guy, aren't ya?

885
01:31:05,777 --> 01:31:06,987
Good little puppies.

886
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:09,030
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

887
01:31:09,072 --> 01:31:10,615
You stay.

888
01:31:10,657 --> 01:31:12,868
Oh. There's a pretty smile.

889
01:31:13,451 --> 01:31:14,536
Yeah.

890
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:16,329
I'm going to, uh...

891
01:31:56,912 --> 01:31:58,288
Hey, dickface.

892
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:00,207
You seen my dog?

893
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:02,334
Have you tried the lobby?

894
01:32:04,669 --> 01:32:05,754
Thank you.

895
01:32:11,718 --> 01:32:12,969
Fuck...

896
01:32:13,011 --> 01:32:14,179
Come on, King.

897
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:15,597
...this.

898
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:34,574
Blade.

899
01:32:35,742 --> 01:32:37,369
Ready to die?

900
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,249
I was born ready, motherfucker.

901
01:32:45,043 --> 01:32:46,628
Motherfucker.

902
01:32:46,711 --> 01:32:48,213
I like that.

903
01:32:49,339 --> 01:32:51,633
Aah!

904
01:33:49,608 --> 01:33:51,401
Aah!

905
01:34:05,874 --> 01:34:07,209
Aah!

906
01:34:16,176 --> 01:34:18,136
Aah!

907
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,603
You broke my arm!

908
01:36:22,677 --> 01:36:25,180
Aah!

909
01:38:16,333 --> 01:38:18,793
Are you ready to die, 
motherfucker?

910
01:39:43,753 --> 01:39:45,088
Give it up.

911
01:39:45,171 --> 01:39:46,673
Come on.
Give it up, King.

912
01:39:47,215 --> 01:39:49,509
Give it up.
Give it up.

913
01:39:49,551 --> 01:39:50,760
Give it up.

914
01:40:17,913 --> 01:40:19,331
Hang in there, kitten.

915
01:40:19,372 --> 01:40:20,749
I'll get help.

916
01:40:31,218 --> 01:40:33,345
Funny, isn't it?

917
01:40:33,887 --> 01:40:38,183
All this time, my people were trying
to create a new kind of vampire,

918
01:40:38,266 --> 01:40:41,436
when one already exists.

919
01:40:43,104 --> 01:40:44,773
I don't need to survive.

920
01:40:44,898 --> 01:40:48,068
The future of our race rests with you.

921
01:40:49,569 --> 01:40:51,404
You fought with honor.

922
01:40:51,446 --> 01:40:53,198
I respect that.

923
01:40:54,699 --> 01:40:56,660
Allow me a parting gift.

924
01:40:58,119 --> 01:40:59,621
But remember this.

925
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:03,708
Sooner or later,

926
01:41:03,792 --> 01:41:07,295
the thirst always wins.

927
01:43:33,288 --> 01:43:34,758
<i>And Drake's final gift...</i>

928
01:43:36,237 --> 01:43:38,159
<i>Let's just say the FBI got 
their body...</i>

929
01:43:42,263 --> 01:43:44,060
<i>...just wasn't the one they 
were banking on.</i>

930
01:44:00,438 --> 01:44:01,861
<i>Blade were still out there,
somewhere...</i>

931
01:44:02,322 --> 01:44:03,962
<i>...doing what he did best.</i>

932
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:06,663
<i>He was a weapon...</i>

933
01:44:07,218 --> 01:44:08,685
<i>...his life was a war...</i>

934
01:44:10,434 --> 01:44:12,645
<i>...and everybody knows the 
war never ends.</i>
