1
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,646
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,123
<i>Thy kingdom come...</i>

3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,241
<i>...thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,289
<i>Give us this day our daily bread...</i>

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,485
<i>...and forgive us our trespasses...</i>

6
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,481
<i>...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,851
<i>Lead us not into temptation...</i>

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,642
<i>...but deliver us from evil.</i>

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,842
<i>For the kingdom, the power
and the glory are yours...</i>

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,363
<i>...now and forever.</i>

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,045
<i>Amen.</i>

12
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,806
<i>Looking at mostly cloudy
skies and with lows in the upper 20s...</i>

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,526
<i>...there will be some refreeze
on some of the roads...</i>

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,490
<i>...so slick spots are possible tonight
in isolated--</i>

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,843
You know the most important thing
your granddad ever taught me?

16
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,131
Hmm?

17
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,330
Be ready.

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,442
Hurricane, flood,
whatever it ends up being.

19
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,044
No more food gets delivered to the
grocery store, gas stations dry up.

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,886
People just turn on
each other, and, uh...

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,081
All of a sudden, all that stands
between you and being dead is you.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,564
I'm proud of you, son.

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,490
It was a nice shot.

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,885
<i>Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water</i>

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,810
<i>Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea</i>

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,602
<i>Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently</i>

27
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,847
<i>Every time I look into the holy book
I wanna tremble</i>

28
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,921
Hey, come on, hon.

29
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,970
Wait. I forgot something.
Hold on a second, Anna!

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,009
- Ralph, you have the venison?
- Yup.

31
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,804
I forgot the pie.

32
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,321
Are we taking the truck?

33
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,801
We're going up the street, you dope.

34
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,405
Come on.

35
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,447
Hey, wait for your mother, please.

36
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,648
Give me a ride.

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,002
Oh, you're getting heavy.

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,365
Danny's dad said
he'd sell me their old car.

39
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,761
I got half of what I need saved
from the summer.

40
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,410
- I thought maybe--
- Forget it.

41
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,763
I can barely get enough carpentry work
to keep up with the mortgage.

42
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,285
Why don't you rent out Grandpa's
old apartment house?

43
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,084
Like I keep telling your mother, it's an old
building. It'll cost a fortune to fix it up.

44
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,529
Oh.

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,849
- Hey.
- Okay, okay.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,604
They're here!

47
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,205
- Hello.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

48
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,885
Anna, wait until we're invited.

49
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,883
For God's sake, Keller.
Get the hell in here.

50
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,084
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Turkey Day.

51
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,971
- Keller, got the deer you shot?
- This one's Ralph's.

52
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,771
- You killed it, you take it into the kitchen.
- Thank you.

53
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,526
- I loved that last meal you gave us.
- There he is.

54
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,409
- Thank you. Happy T-Day.
- How are you?

55
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,608
- All right.
- Good to see you.

56
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,845
Joy, three times.
Joy, get those dolls off the table.

57
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,202
- Anna! Anna!
- Hi. How are you?

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,646
Happy Thanksgiving.

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,723
- Hi, Eliza.
- Anna, come here.

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,727
We wait until we're invited,
you understand?

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,082
You're in charge of this.

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,971
Us veterinarians make lousy butchers.

63
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,770
No problem.

64
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,851
Can I go outside with Joy?

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,209
Uh, convince your brother
to go with you and you can.

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,245
And wear a hat, please.
You're just getting over a cold.

67
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,408
Joy, you wear a hat too.

68
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,086
<i>Did you feel bad for
that deer when you shot it?</i>

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,003
Do you feel bad for cows
when you go to McDonald's?

70
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,889
That's what my dad says.
Deer, if they have too many babies...

71
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,163
...the babies starve anyway.
You gotta keep the population down.

72
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,765
Right.

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,567
- Your dad say that too?
- Pull harder.

74
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,563
Hey! Get away from that thing!

75
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,205
Let me see that.

76
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,442
- Come on, let's go.
- No.

77
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,721
I said, let's go!

78
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,565
Stop. Stop. You can't just hit
somebody's stuff like that.

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,167
- No! Let's go! Come on, come on.
- Let me--!

80
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,131
Wait. You hear that?

81
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,968
Somebody's in there.

82
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,767
I don't feel like getting yelled at. Let's go.
Don't climb up, okay?

83
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,245
<i>And it causes me shame to know
We're not the people we should be</i>

84
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,562
The school board's telling me
there's no money for new band uniforms.

85
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,644
Kids are wearing the same uniforms
they had when we went there.

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,650
They were old then.
I mean, marching right out of 1979.

87
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,888
Why isn't he speaking to me?

88
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,883
He doesn't speak.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,843
- Cutie pie.
- Mm-hm.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,650
- Oh, my gosh!
- Whoa.

91
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,962
- He's fast too.
- Mm.

92
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,646
He's so quick. Is that a slide?

93
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,610
Thank y'all. Thank y'all.
Got a surprise.

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,603
Oh.

95
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,009
And I am taking requests.

96
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,770
- Yes! Yes.
- No.

97
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,521
Okay.

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,126
You gotta listen out for it
because this is not easy.

99
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,442
Mommy, can I take Joy to our house?

100
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,409
- Why?
- My red whistle.

101
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,210
She's gonna help me look for it.

102
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,091
Sweetheart, I think that red whistle
is long gone.

103
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,366
What whistle?

104
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,808
The emergency whistle Daddy gave me.
I lost it...

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,571
...a hundred and 33 days ago.

106
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,370
Well, if you want to find a whistle,
you have to whistle for it.

107
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,688
So we'll do "Jingle Bells" to find it.

108
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,807
<i>Jingle Bells,
Batman smells Robin laid an egg</i>

109
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,566
<i>The Batmobile lost its wheel
And Joker got away</i>

110
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,165
- Okay.
- Yay!

111
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,246
Okay! Okay. You can go. All right.

112
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,449
Just make sure Eliza
and Ralph go with you, please.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,324
- No looking in the basement.
- I won't.

114
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,563
Your eardrums are starting to grow.
Don't want to damage them yet.

115
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,206
- But I am taking requests from you, Keller.
- From me?

116
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,409
- Your day, your request.
- Oh. Uh, the piano.

117
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,245
- No. So all set?
- No, no, no.

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,529
Wait, listen. He used to love--
He used to dress like Springsteen.

119
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,921
- I still love Springsteen.
- "Jersey Girl."

120
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,883
Well, I ain't white, and I like him too much,
and I'm too drunk to cover The Boss.

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,451
- Thank you.
- Honey?

122
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,001
- What else?
- Nothing comes to mind. Nothing.

123
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,009
- Oh, I know.
- What?

124
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,285
He actually loves "The Star-Spangled Banner."
I know. Sings it in the shower.

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,442
- I do not.
- Yes, you do!

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,761
I got you.

127
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,164
Where are your sisters?

128
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,324
I can't find them.

129
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
You, uh, go to the house with them?

130
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,169
No. What are you talking about?

131
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,641
- Earlier?
- No.

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,521
What? They were supposed to come down
earlier and get you. They didn't come?

133
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,489
No. We haven't seen them since we ate.

134
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,325
It's all right.
They're probably at our house.

135
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,365
Anna?

136
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,329
Joy?

137
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,685
Anna?

138
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,450
Girls?

139
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,166
Girls?

140
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,883
- Who put these in here?
- Get out of here.

141
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,647
- They weren't outside. It's starting to rain.
- Did you check by Maria's swing?

142
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,211
Yeah.

143
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,007
They're getting whupped when they
get here. Sorry, Grace. I whup kids.

144
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,844
What?
So they weren't there either?

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,889
- They must be at home.
- Are they here?

146
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
- They weren't there?
- No, they're not at the house.

147
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,927
They're not there.

148
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,686
I checked the entire house.
They're not here.

149
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,442
The RV.

150
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,251
Dad, there was this RV
and they were playing on it.

151
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,801
There was--
We thought there was someone inside.

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,206
- Wait, nobody--
- Where?

153
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,089
Where was it?
Show me.

154
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,163
- You wait here.
- Let me go!

155
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,687
- I'm gonna search the house again.
- Relax. Relax.

156
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,366
Go that way.
I'll meet you on the other side.

157
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,771
Anna?

158
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,490
Joy!

159
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,170
- Roger, you seen my daughter walk by here?
- No. Is there a problem?

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,965
Anna?

161
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,443
Here! Dad, it was parked right here.

162
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,649
Anna? Anna?

163
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,284
- Hello, hello!
- Did you see them?

164
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,602
- No!
- Hello!

165
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,847
- I couldn't find them!
- Were you messing around in this house?

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,525
- No.
- Told you not to come here.

167
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,802
They were on the RV
and we got them off of it.

168
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,281
Tell me everything you remember
about that RV.

169
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,808
- A ladder on the back.
- Police, police.

170
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,883
Happy Thanksgiving.

171
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,409
Thanks. Hey, you have any of those
fortune cookie things?

172
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,484
My boss told me cops
don't like fortune cookies.

173
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,326
What year were you born? Are you a
dragon or a snake or a horse, or--?

174
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,005
I'm a monkey.

175
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,811
Oh, you're a monkey.

176
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,686
You're very intelligent.
You have an ability to influence people.

177
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,128
Think you could influence your boss
to lower the check a little bit?

178
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,127
No. I cannot. My boss is a rooster.

179
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,731
So he's selfish and eccentric, that's...

180
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,727
<i>All units, all units. An RV
was reported matching the description.</i>

181
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,687
<i>The vehicle is parked at a rest stop
off of Route 46, northbound, past exit 17.</i>

182
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,291
<i>Any available units?</i>

183
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,442
<i>This is 12-12 responding.</i>

184
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,724
<i>10-80 responding.</i>

185
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,204
This is 13-40. I'm five minutes out.
I'll meet the responding units.

186
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,242
<i>- 12-12 standing by.
10-80 standing by.</i>

187
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,246
13-40. I am on-scene.
Be advised, we are moving in.

188
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,046
Don't move, wait!

189
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,201
Whoa. Whoa!

190
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,285
- Watch out!
- Hey! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

191
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,521
Don't shoot!

192
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,961
Don't shoot!

193
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,609
All right, Sloan, take the right!

194
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,165
Clear!

195
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,491
Clear!

196
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,170
Hey! Wait, wait, wait. I got this.

197
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,049
Give me that.

198
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,491
Hey.

199
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,042
Hey, I see you in there.
Show me both your hands right now.

200
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,846
Hey! I see you in there.
Show me your hands!

201
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,681
Both hands right now!

202
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,525
Nice and slow. Slow. Slow! Slow.
Slowly. Both hands.

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,048
Both fucking hands!

204
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,840
Walk! Walk!

205
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,805
Walk! Get up! Get up!

206
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,165
Get up!

207
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,603
Show me those girls!
Show me where you put those girls.

208
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,411
Where are those girls?
Where are those girls?

209
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,130
- Give me the flashlight.
- Sir.

210
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,641
Show me where those girls--
They in the woods?

211
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,928
You put them in the woods?

212
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,361
Where did you put those girls?

213
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,890
You hear me?

214
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,084
What the fuck is this guy on?

215
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,410
No, he's high on something.

216
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,006
Put this fucking guy in the car.
Get him in the car.

217
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,811
- Put him in the fucking car! Walk!
- Let's go.

218
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,564
Hey, call P.S.P.,
tell them to send their scent dogs.

219
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,048
And seal off the whole area.
The entrance, all of it.

220
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,124
- Right.
- You, come with me.

221
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,006
No, they weren't playing on your RV?

222
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,605
No.

223
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,563
Okay, take a look at them again.

224
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,888
- Don't recognize these girls?
- I didn't see them. May I sit down?

225
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,286
<i>What do you do in the RV?</i>

226
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,930
<i>- Answer my questions.
- Sleep there.</i>

227
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,806
<i>You sleep in there?
You were sleeping out there? In the day?</i>

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,083
Why was the RV
parked outside the house?

229
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,049
Hmm...

230
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,521
I went for a drive?

231
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,849
You went for a drive?
You weren't driving.

232
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,923
<i>I know girls were playing
outside your RV.</i>

233
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,090
You weren't driving. It was parked.
Was it a special day?

234
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,134
Were you planning on
taking two little girls?

235
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,632
No.

236
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,240
- Have you done that before?
- No.

237
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,327
<i>- Did you ask them to come inside?
- No.</i>

238
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,641
<i>You ask them to come in...</i>

239
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,609
<i>- ...and then you take them away?
- No.</i>

240
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,728
- You put those girls somewhere?
- May I sit?

241
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,405
- Come on.
- Please don't touch me.

242
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,688
I know you put those girls somewhere.

243
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,086
- You hide them?
- No.

244
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,686
How did you hide them.
Did you tie them up?

245
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,444
- Did you tie them up?
- Hmm.

246
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,887
Huh? Hey. Hey.

247
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,691
Hey.

248
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,764
Look, I know you're a good guy.
I know you're a decent guy.

249
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,002
<i>I'm not telling you
you're doing anything bad.</i>

250
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,687
<i>I'm just trying to get the right answers.
The real ones. That's all I want.</i>

251
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,411
Where do you usually park your RV, Alex?

252
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,727
My aunt's house.

253
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,927
<i>Your aunt's house?</i>

254
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,889
<i>She lets me park
it in the back yard.</i>

255
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,647
<i>Grass don't grow back there anyway.</i>

256
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,367
It was my husband's.

257
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,887
For sale, if you want it.

258
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,531
No, thanks.

259
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,682
Would you tell me what you're
doing on my property then?

260
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,203
I'm just glad to know where he is.

261
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,365
He's always home before dark, and...

262
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,885
...I just don't understand.

263
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,567
That boy has never been in trouble,
not a day in his life.

264
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,169
In the summertime,
he sleeps out in the camper some, but...

265
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,325
...this time of year he sleeps
in here on the sofa bed.

266
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,243
That's my husband.

267
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,405
We had a fight, jeez, five years ago.

268
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,126
Walked out, didn't come back.

269
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,364
Alex loved him like a father.

270
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,607
Where are Alex's real parents?

271
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,888
My husband's brother
and his girlfriend...

272
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,170
...they died in a car accident
when Alex was about 6.

273
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,084
Sorry to hear that.

274
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,127
He doesn't have much.

275
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,290
What have you got?

276
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,650
Well, this thing's clean. I mean, it's filthy
as shit, but we didn't find anything.

277
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,650
You didn't find any wool fibers,
anything like that?

278
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,641
The girls could be wearing some wool
gloves or wool hat, no cotton fibers?

279
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,451
If he was using this to transport them,
I might buy that.

280
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,689
But if there had been a struggle,
I would have found something.

281
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,650
I'd start looking in the woods
by the rest stop.

282
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,920
Yeah, half the uniformed cops
in the state are doing that right now.

283
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,206
When you're done with this thing, can you
send a crew over to the aunt's house?

284
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,005
Anna?

285
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,884
Anna?

286
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,048
Thanks for coming. Franklin Birch.

287
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,282
My wife's in here.

288
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,642
Honey? Her name's Nancy.

289
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,565
Detective Loki is-- Honey?

290
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,250
These photos are better
than the ones my husband gave you.

291
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,926
You can see her eyes more clearly.

292
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,090
So did we pass?

293
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,608
I'm sorry, what did you say?

294
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,483
The poly thing, the lie detector
we took this morning.

295
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,483
Did we pass?

296
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,850
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

297
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,324
Yes. We appreciate your cooperation.

298
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,442
It's embarrassing,
all the-- All this fuss.

299
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,449
Everyone's gonna think we're crazy...

300
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,649
...when those two come out of hiding,
wherever they are.

301
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,844
Do you have some reason
to believe they ran away?

302
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,490
No.

303
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,123
They're happy.

304
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,001
They must have run away.

305
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,362
I think they must have run away. Right?

306
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,771
Um...

307
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,965
Your police captain told me
that you've solved every case...

308
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,084
...that you've ever been assigned.
Is that right?

309
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,650
Sorry.

310
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,971
I am so sorry.
Do you have children, detective?

311
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,682
I'm gonna find your daughter.

312
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,441
We believe they came back here after
they left you at the Birches' yesterday.

313
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,171
They were looking for
Anna's red whistle.

314
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,165
Right.

315
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,688
I read your statement.

316
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,409
I'm Detective Loki.

317
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,083
I'm heading up the investigation
into your daughter's disappearance.

318
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,527
Please sit down.

319
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,010
My son already told you that the guy was
inside the RV just watching them, right?

320
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,884
We haven't found
any physical evidence inside the RV.

321
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,566
Or his aunt's house where he lives.

322
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,247
- Nothing?
- Alex Jones...

323
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,370
...unfortunately has the I.Q.
of a 10-year-old.

324
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,171
There's no way someone
with the I.Q. of a 10-year-old...

325
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,886
...could abduct two girls
in broad daylight, and then...

326
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,969
...somehow make them disappear.

327
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,691
Well, how can he drive an RV?

328
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,528
If he can't answer a question...

329
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,365
Well, he has a legal
Pennsylvania license.

330
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,251
And he ran, right?
They said he tried to run away.

331
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,246
Why--? Why? Why would he run?

332
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,009
I've just spent ten hours
questioning this boy.

333
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,828
Okay? I hear what you're saying.

334
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,570
Uh...

335
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,491
Did you give him a lie detector?
You gave us a lie-- Did you give him one?

336
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,967
I understand what you're asking me.
Yes, we did.

337
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,521
We gave him a lie detector,
and there's no way of...

338
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,043
A lie detector doesn't work
if you don't understand the questions.

339
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,488
Well, maybe he wasn't on his own.
How could he drive an RV...

340
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,247
- ...if he has an I.Q. of a 10-year-old?
- We're considering all possibilities.

341
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,324
- I don't think you are considering--
I hear what you're saying.

342
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,131
Listen to me. Shut the fuck up
for a fucking second!

343
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,602
This is what I'm gonna need you to do
for me. I need you to calm down.

344
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,285
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please listen to me for a second.

345
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,046
Mr. Dover, I understand
this is an incredibly hard time.

346
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,364
But I have every uniformed police
officer in this state looking for Anna.

347
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,643
I don't understand what any of this means.
They said he ran.

348
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,931
They said he tried to get away. I don't
understand why he would try to run away.

349
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,565
We're considering all possibilities,
Mr. Dover.

350
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,324
I hear what you're saying.

351
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,280
I'm not crossing anybody off my list.
Just...

352
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,842
...let me do my job.

353
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,331
Hey!

354
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,330
Detective!

355
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,328
- Shit.
- Hey!

356
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,963
He stays in custody
until my daughter's found, right?

357
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,167
Right?

358
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,210
We have a 48 hour hold on him
unless we bring charges.

359
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,529
Well, charge him with something.
Charge him.

360
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,967
- Mr. Dover, I understand what you're--
- Two girls have got to be worth...

361
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,010
...whatever rule you break
to keep that asshole in custody.

362
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,601
I know you can't promise me anything.
I understand.

363
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,731
But I'm asking you to be sure.
Be 100% sure.

364
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,885
Thank you.

365
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,009
I appreciate it.

366
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,565
So you're positive he's innocent,
but you want to hold him?

367
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,524
Anna's father was
a mess this morning.

368
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,202
- I understand. But it's not gonna happen.
- I was asking for one more day.

369
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,647
Fuck you. Oh, no.

370
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,486
Find his daughter, he'll forgive you.
You don't, he's gonna hate you anyway.

371
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,290
So, what's next?

372
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,601
- I'm knocking on doors all night.
- You're coming up on 24 hours missing...

373
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,242
...and you have exactly shit.
- I've got nine level-three sex offenders...

374
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,847
...living within a 10-mile radius of
Fairmont Circle. So if you don't mind.

375
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,081
- Then go.
- Yeah.

376
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,526
Go.

377
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,164
It's right here.

378
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,249
Look, I'm staying straight, okay?

379
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,961
No, it's-- Hey, look.
Look, I know you're--

380
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,810
- I was--
Like yourself some German porn, huh?

381
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,610
Look, I was--

382
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,769
Father! Open up! It's the police!

383
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,690
Father.

384
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,490
Father.

385
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,007
Mind if I take a look around?

386
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,723
Fucking drunk.

387
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,884
What the fuck?

388
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,084
Whoa.

389
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,730
Fuck.

390
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,442
Aah. Fuck.

391
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,002
Aah! Please, God, God!

392
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,885
What's the name of your buddy down
there? What's the name?

393
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,367
- I don't know his name.
- Huh? You don't know his name?

394
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,329
- I don't know his name.
- You know what?

395
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,883
I spent six years in Huntington Boys' Home.
You know the Huntington Boys' Home, right?

396
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,362
Hurting a fuck like you'd be a treat.
Why don't you tell me his name?

397
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,162
He didn't tell me his name.
He came to me for a confession.

398
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,211
He said he'd killed 16 children.
He bragged about it.

399
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,490
I convinced him to come back here.
He said he'd kill more.

400
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,802
Sixteen children, huh?

401
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,407
- All right, let's go, you fucking chicken-hawk.
- Aah!

402
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,401
<i>- Hey.
- They're letting him go.</i>

403
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,204
- What?
- The man.

404
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,442
<i>The police
said they're letting him go today.</i>

405
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,888
Oh, okay. I'll take care of it.

406
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,440
- Dad?
- Keep searching.

407
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,762
Where are you going?

408
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,606
They want you to write your whole name.

409
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,485
That's good.

410
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,809
Mm-hm. Good job.
Now you give it to the man.

411
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,248
All right. Come on. I don't want
you minding these people out here.

412
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,966
Don't talk to them.
You've got nothing to say to them.

413
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,049
- Hey!
- Alex!

414
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,646
Back, back.

415
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,445
Let them walk.

416
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,849
- Alex!
- Come on, Alex.

417
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,331
You took those kids, didn't you?

418
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,131
I just want to talk.
He's a free man, I'm a free man!

419
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,002
- No!
- Hey!

420
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,766
Tell me what you did with them!
Tell me!

421
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,604
They didn't cry until I left them.

422
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,127
What did you say? What did you say?

423
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,647
No. no! No!

424
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,689
Fucking get off him!

425
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,285
God. Get up!

426
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,647
Get him down! Get him down!

427
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,802
- Move back! Move back!
- Come on.

428
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,682
Please, just let us go. Thanks for nothing.
We're fine. Thank you.

429
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,608
Now, I know your dad was a guard
at Graterford.

430
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,962
And I've got a daughter of my own, so...

431
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,203
...we're gonna pretend
this never happened.

432
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,561
And as for Alex Jones, he has orders
not to leave the commonwealth.

433
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,884
- What?
- Sir, I need you to go home. All right?

434
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,691
- I need you to go home.
- What about what I just told you?

435
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,410
Why aren't you sending someone
to arrest this guy?

436
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,201
Tell Detective Loki what you just told
me, and he'll definitely look into it.

437
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,725
Go ahead.

438
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,168
That asshole you promised me you'd
keep in custody, right? And you didn't.

439
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,244
When I grabbed him in the parking lot,
he said right to my face:

440
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,722
"They didn't cry until I left them."
Right to my fucking face.

441
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,763
He said that to you in the parking lot?

442
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,645
Right now, yeah. What did I just say?
In the parking lot.

443
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,081
Before you grabbed me off him.

444
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,687
Did anyone else hear it besides you?

445
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,164
I don't know. It was quiet. He said it to me.
He wanted me to know.

446
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,163
- Are you sure he said that?
- What?

447
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,888
Are you sure that's what he said?

448
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,681
Jesus Christ, you think I'm making this up?
Why would I make this up?

449
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,285
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No. No.

450
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,330
- Think about it. Why would I make this up?
- I'm not saying that.

451
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,370
I'm just asking you a couple questions.
I will talk to him.

452
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,411
- No, don't talk to him! Arrest him!
- Mr. Dover.

453
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,288
What did I fucking tell you?

454
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,091
What did I tell you?
One more day.

455
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,366
You sure you didn't say anything
to Mr. Dover in the parking lot today?

456
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,044
Anything he could have
misinterpreted or...?

457
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,131
I was right there.

458
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,921
They didn't say anything to each other.
Man just attacked the boy.

459
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,204
Nothing like "get away from me"
or "help" or...

460
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,323
...anything like that?

461
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,130
No.

462
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,168
Can I speak to Alex
alone for a minute?

463
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,723
It's all right, sweetie.
I'll be right in the next room.

464
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,322
You love your aunt,
don't you, Alex?

465
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,641
Yes.

466
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,370
If you know something you're not telling us,
she could go to jail for a very long time.

467
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,048
Do you want that for her?

468
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,688
After everything she's done for you?

469
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,325
No.

470
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,200
Mr. Dover, it's Detective Loki.

471
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,730
<i>- Have you arrested him?
- Look, I just came from Alex Jones.</i>

472
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,121
<i>He said he didn't say anything
to you in the lot.</i>

473
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,171
I pushed him pretty hard, he didn't budge.
We can't waste any more time on this guy.

474
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,166
You're gonna have to trust me.
I'll let you know if I have anything new--

475
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,646
For the--

476
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,003
Fucking A.

477
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,248
The zipper on her coat was broken,
and I told her it didn't matter...

478
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,926
...because we were just gonna go
right down the street.

479
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,163
- No. No.
- Why hasn't she come home?

480
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,607
It's been three days.

481
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,287
Why can't you make her come home?

482
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,682
I don't understand.

483
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,564
I don't understand. It's been too long.

484
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,770
Please make her come home.

485
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,571
- Please.
- How many of these...?

486
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,166
How many of these?
How many of these? How many?

487
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,244
- I don't know!
- Shh. Okay, that's all right.

488
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,209
Just take one.

489
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,605
Here.

490
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,884
No.

491
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,525
I just want to sleep.
I just want to go to sleep.

492
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,645
You...

493
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,966
You made me feel so safe.

494
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,647
You told us that you could protect us
from everything.

495
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,649
Oh, God.

496
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,168
I'm gonna go out and help the police.
Just keep an eye on your mother.

497
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,171
Your sister needs us
to be brave for her.

498
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,361
Be brave for her. Be a grown-up for me,
okay? Can you do that?

499
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,768
Can you do that? I know you're scared.
Look at me. Come here.

500
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,843
I know you're scared.

501
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,403
It's gonna be okay.

502
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,203
<i>The former
is a reason why we should be very patient...</i>

503
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,922
<i>...the latter why we should be very
penitent when we are afflicted.</i>

504
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,684
<i>He reminds him that trouble and
affliction are what we have all reason...</i>

505
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,965
<i>...to expect in this world.
Man is brought into trouble...</i>

506
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,682
<i>...not as man, but as sinful man,
who was in transgression.</i>

507
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,969
<i>Man born in sin
and therefore born to trouble.</i>

508
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,161
Come on. Come on, Tucker.

509
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,324
<i>Jingle bells, Batman smells</i>

510
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,960
<i>Robin laid an egg</i>

511
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,964
<i>The Batmobile lost its wheels</i>

512
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,283
<i>Joker got away, hey</i>

513
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,809
<i>Jingle bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg</i>

514
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,889
<i>Jingle bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg</i>

515
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,610
Alex.

516
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,091
<i>Lost its wheel</i>

517
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,363
That song.
Where did you hear those words?

518
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,691
Hmm?

519
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,049
Did you bring a change of clothes
like I told you?

520
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,361
Yeah. You gonna tell me why?

521
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,204
It's better if I just show you.

522
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,245
Show me what?

523
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,169
- Didn't you used to live here?
- Mm-hm.

524
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,851
Close the door. Lock it.

525
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,764
Wow.

526
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,804
Oh, my God. What did you do?

527
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,491
- Keller, what the hell?
- I heard him singing the song...

528
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,779
...they were singing.
Swear to God, Franklin.

529
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:35,874
The same fucking song.

530
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,382
And I told you what he
said in the parking lot.

531
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:40,115
Then we take him to the police.

532
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,325
No. The police won't do shit. He'll just
clam up and act crazy like last time.

533
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,802
Someone has to make him talk. Someone.

534
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,527
Shit, man. This ain't right.
What if you're wrong?

535
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,001
- I'm not wrong.
- But what if you're wrong?

536
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,322
What if you only heard
what you wanted to hear?

537
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,165
What if--?
Man, I want my daughter back...

538
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,648
...as much as you do, but it ain't right.
- Franklin, Franklin!

539
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,685
We hurt him until he talks,
or they're gonna die.

540
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,725
- This ain't--
- No. No.

541
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,485
We hurt him until he talks
or they're gonna die.

542
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,443
That's the choice.

543
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,203
That's the choice you have to make.

544
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,529
I've made my choice.

545
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,370
I know what I heard.

546
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,127
He's not a person anymore.

547
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,841
No, he stopped being a person
when he took our daughters.

548
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,809
I need your help.

549
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,723
This is your last chance.

550
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,242
I know you're scared.
I know you wanna go home.

551
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,131
All right? I know.
I don't want to hurt you. I don't.

552
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,285
I'm gonna take the tape off, and I
want you to tell me where they are.

553
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,843
Hey. Come on.

554
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,088
Did you see my glasses?

555
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,605
What?

556
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,091
I can't see.

557
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,084
If you're not gonna talk, Alex,
I'm gonna have to hurt you.

558
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,044
Tell me where they are.

559
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,323
Where are they?

560
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,443
Tell me where they are!

561
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,048
I'm out here at a
house on Fairmont Circle.

562
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,171
That house the RV was parked in front of.
It's been on the market a couple months.

563
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,766
I'm gonna track the owners,
see if they know anything.

564
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,043
Got any new info on that corpse
we found in the priest's basement?

565
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,170
<i>No DNA, dental, or fingerprint matches.</i>

566
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,367
Nothing.

567
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,285
<i>Priest is sticking to the story too.</i>

568
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,131
All right.

569
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,483
Same person who took him,
took those girls. I'm sure of it.

570
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,207
Wearing out the tape, I guess.

571
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,005
I watch it every day after breakfast.
It's the only video I have of him.

572
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,088
It was before your time.

573
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,567
Twenty-six years ago, August 19th.

574
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,528
I took a nap in the afternoon,
and when I woke up, Barry was gone.

575
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,602
No one could ever tell me
what happened to him.

576
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,489
He was playing in the front yard...

577
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,531
...just a few feet from where
they say that RV was parked.

578
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,968
What do you think that means?

579
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,201
I'm more interested
in what you think that means.

580
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,007
I don't think we'll ever know.

581
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,207
It's just like Barry.

582
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,485
No one took them. Nothing happened.

583
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,607
They're just gone.

584
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,242
- He's gonna say to you.
- Yeah, right.

585
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,048
How you doing, Father?

586
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,881
I'm getting better.

587
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,529
So Detective Chemelinski tells me
that you have some specifics...

588
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,200
...about the crime
you claim that guy committed.

589
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,564
The abductor.

590
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,650
He was...

591
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,371
...waging a war against God.

592
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,726
Great. That's great.

593
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,045
I thought you said
he had something specific. I'm not--

594
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,289
Tell him how he took the kids.

595
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,089
He said...

596
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,891
...he took them in daylight.

597
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,808
Sometimes...

598
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,126
...more than one child at a time.

599
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,561
- He said that?
- Yes.

600
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,603
Did he say he was with anybody?
He did it alone?

601
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,011
He...

602
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,645
He said he had a family.

603
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,610
That's it?

604
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,525
All right.

605
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,049
Informative.

606
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,846
You said they cried when you left them.

607
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,001
Look at me.

608
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:33,167
You said they cried when you left them!

609
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,010
Now tell me!

610
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,641
Where is she? Hmm?

611
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,689
Tell me where they are!

612
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,885
Just tell me.
Just tell me and I'll stop.

613
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,048
I'll stop as soon as you tell me.

614
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,845
Just...

615
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,887
Just tell me where they are.

616
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,848
Why won't you tell me?

617
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,240
Huh?

618
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,886
Why won't you just fucking tell us?

619
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,562
He knows. He knows.

620
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,490
I can see it in his eyes.
He fucking knows.

621
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,842
I know you know!
Why aren't you fucking telling me?

622
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,085
Why?

623
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,410
Fine.

624
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,926
- Get him up. Get him up.
- Oh, God.

625
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,283
Get up. Get up. Get up!

626
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,248
You gonna make me use this?

627
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,970
You gonna tell us?
If you don't, I'm gonna use this.

628
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,450
Fine.

629
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,282
You're doing this to yourself.

630
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,850
Just tell us. Tell me.

631
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,363
Tell me!

632
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,731
Tell me!

633
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,611
Tell me! Tell me!

634
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,841
Where's my daughter?

635
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,009
<i>Four days have
passed since Anna Dover and Joy Birch...</i>

636
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,605
<i>...were last seen by their families.</i>

637
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,286
<i>The two girls, aged 6 and 7,
are believed to have been...</i>

638
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,166
<i>...playing on this street when they
disappeared without a trace.</i>

639
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,203
<i>As you can see, despite the cold...</i>

640
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,011
<i>...a lot of people have turned out
to show their support.</i>

641
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,363
<i>Police are asking that anyone
with any information...</i>

642
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,730
Where have you been?

643
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,810
I was searching for her in the woods.

644
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,290
I'm okay.

645
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,010
God.

646
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,449
Franklin, what is it?

647
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,802
I just need a minute.

648
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,250
What the fuck? Get off of me!

649
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,641
Hey! Hey!

650
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,684
Okay.

651
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,484
<i>And this is who police are
saying is a person of interest...</i>

652
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,486
<i>...in the investigation of the two
missing girls. This unidentified man...</i>

653
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,247
<i>...who was last seen at last night's
candlelight vigil, fled on foot...</i>

654
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,166
<i>...when the investigating detective
attempted to question him.</i>

655
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,448
<i>Police caution the public
not to approach this man...</i>

656
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,768
<i>...but to call police immediately
if they do see him.</i>

657
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,891
<i>Thanks, John, for that update.
And now for the weather.</i>

658
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,123
<i>We should expect heavy rain
into the early evening and--</i>

659
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,407
Look, Keller, I mean,
just think about it.

660
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,087
Why would the police be looking for this
man if they didn't think he did it?

661
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,402
They did it together.
They know each other.

662
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,360
I fucking told you.
Jones looked me in the eye and he said:

663
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,443
"They only cried when I left them."

664
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,729
He left them with someone,
and he knows where this guy is.

665
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,328
Holly Jones' dog got hit
on Southward Street.

666
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,569
Alex took the dog for a walk
night before last. Never came home.

667
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,530
His aunt didn't want to tell us
when we called her about it.

668
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,047
She said it would get him
into trouble or some shit.

669
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,722
- You said you'd keep him under surveillance.
- You said the guy was innocent.

670
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,531
I thought the guy from last night
you said was our guy.

671
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,570
I don't have money in the budget
for watching innocent people.

672
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,564
- You said you'd put him under surveillance.
- What do you want?

673
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,803
Keep your word. Give me a call,
I would have been there all night.

674
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,411
I would know where he was now.

675
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,246
- I need to know where everybody is.
- All right, point made. Point made.

676
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,722
If you be clear, then I'll be clear.
I need to know where everybody is.

677
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,042
If you do something different,
please tell me.

678
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,325
<i>Tell me about your RV.</i>

679
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,249
<i>What do you do in your RV?</i>

680
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,602
<i>It's where I go...</i>

681
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,484
<i>...to be alone-</i>

682
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,889
<i>What music do you
listen to in your RV...</i>

683
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,644
<i>...when you're alone?</i>

684
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,602
<i>Radio, tape.</i>

685
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,444
<i>The RV was parked
over on Fairmont Circle?</i>

686
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,850
<i>No. ls my aunt coming?</i>

687
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,729
<i>I-- I-- I...</i>

688
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,882
<i>Have you seen these girls?</i>

689
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,648
<i>- No.
- You take a look at them.</i>

690
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,131
<i>You seen these girls?</i>

691
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,485
No.

692
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,087
<i>Did you participate in any way
in the abduction of those girls?</i>

693
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,966
No.

694
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,686
Loki! You got a call.

695
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,605
All right.

696
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,360
I called as soon
as I saw the sketch on TV.

697
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,966
He comes in here every week
and buys kids' clothes.

698
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,691
But he's always buying stuff
in different sizes.

699
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,804
Caught him messing around
with the mannequins once.

700
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,611
- What did he pay with?
- Cash.

701
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,561
All right, give me a call
if you hear anything.

702
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,165
Okay.

703
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,527
It's been five days.

704
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,526
Maybe five days
since they had a drink of water.

705
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,204
This could be the last
night that matters.

706
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,571
Look, I'll call you after
Nancy goes to sleep, all right?

707
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,364
Promise.

708
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,807
Where have you been all this time?

709
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,362
What the hell were you thinking?

710
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,683
You tell anyone?

711
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,851
Did you?

712
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,569
I wanna see him.

713
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,571
Shh.

714
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,089
Please help me.

715
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,810
Could you help me
find my little girl?

716
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,609
Got a picture.

717
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,250
See?

718
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,443
This my baby.

719
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,525
You see her?

720
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,281
Her name is Joy.

721
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,370
And, um...

722
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:11,006
This is a stuffed animal
we got her when she was 2...

723
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,004
...because she's afraid
to sleep by herself. Please...

724
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:19,166
...tell me where my little girl is.
Please tell me where my little girl is.

725
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,724
I know you're gonna tell me.
I know you're gonna tell me.

726
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,161
I know.

727
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,731
Shh, shh.

728
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,089
Help me.

729
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,887
Help me.

730
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,849
Franklin, can you
close the door to the--?

731
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,410
Nancy!

732
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,402
- What the fuck you doing?
- Aah!

733
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,281
- Goddamn it! Damn!
- Aah!

734
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,171
Let it go. Let it go!

735
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,521
You untied him? Huh?

736
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,769
That was close.

737
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,571
- What is it? What happened?
- Get Franklin. I need to show you something.

738
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,721
Did he say anything new?

739
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,326
He will soon. You'll see.

740
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,523
No light gets in.

741
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,724
There's barely enough room
to sit down inside.

742
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,686
Shower still works,
but we control from out here.

743
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,722
And I rigged the water heater so it
either comes out scalding or freezing.

744
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,804
And, uh, you talk to him through this.

745
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,686
It's to remind us...

746
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,247
...in case we start
feeling sorry for him.

747
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,730
My God.

748
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,044
I can't hurt him any more without
killing him, so this is the only way.

749
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,006
Have you lost your mind, Keller?

750
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,722
Do you have a better idea, Franklin?

751
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,251
Do you?

752
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,243
Go ahead. Let him out, if you want.
I'm not gonna stop you.

753
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,764
If that's what you really want,
you go ahead.

754
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,446
You think someone's looking out for our
girls the way you're looking out for him?

755
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,044
I hope.

756
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,402
It's been five days now, man.
We're running out of time.

757
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,762
- You don't even know it's him.
- Yeah, I do.

758
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,641
- No, you don't. I know you. You don't.
- I do.

759
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,491
Look, I want my baby back...

760
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,011
...as much as you miss Anna.

761
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,966
And despite what you think about me...

762
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,282
...I would die for my daughter.

763
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,682
But this ain't right.

764
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,963
This has to stop.

765
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,601
Well, then you better get to work.

766
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,802
I'd start with that wall there.

767
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,525
Franklin.

768
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,530
Stop.

769
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,850
Franklin, think of Joy.

770
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,891
I need to get out of this place, Ralph.

771
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,443
Everything in this house
just makes me want to throw up.

772
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,768
Your dad's building?

773
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,761
There is no way
I'm staying in that crackhouse.

774
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,888
It's disgusting.

775
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,088
Yeah, okay.

776
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,523
We're not gonna help Keller,
but we won't stop him either.

777
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,047
Let him do what he needs to.

778
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,761
We don't know about it anymore.

779
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,130
Eliza?

780
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,889
Eliza?

781
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,729
Eliza?

782
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,643
Eliza, open the door!

783
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,247
- Eliza?
- Is she in there?

784
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,165
Honey?

785
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,370
- Eliza.
- Get out of the way! Hey--

786
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,649
Fuck you both. Next time you plan
on leaving me here alone...

787
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,690
...maybe you could try at least
telling me where you're going.

788
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,205
Ralph?

789
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,565
Anna?

790
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,804
Anna?

791
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,285
Anna.

792
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,731
Anna?

793
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,251
Anna?

794
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,685
Mom?

795
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,681
- Mom? What are you doing?
- Anna was here.

796
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,606
It's freezing in here. Mom. Hey, Morn!
Sit down. Stop. Calm down.

797
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,161
I'm gonna close the window.

798
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,802
And she wasn't here.

799
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,049
And then I heard a sound
from my room, and I--

800
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,410
I came in and the window was open.
And...

801
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,927
And it wasn't open before.

802
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:43,927
And then-- And then Ralph,
he came in...

803
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,606
...and he looked and, um...

804
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,365
And then...

805
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,123
Then I don't know.

806
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,960
Aren't you gonna write this down?

807
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,008
The basement. I didn't check the basement.
We need to check the basement.

808
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,481
I'll show you.
I'll show you.

809
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,811
The kids know
they're not allowed down here.

810
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,686
They're not supposed to come down here,
but I don't know.

811
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:59,123
My husband likes to be prepared
for emergencies.

812
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,483
Where is your husband, Mrs. Dover?

813
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,845
I was gonna ask you. He's been out
searching with the police for Anna.

814
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,480
Which you should be doing right now.

815
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,723
Does he always stay out this late?

816
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,849
Yes, he stays out this late
when he's looking for my daughter...

817
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,162
...since my daughter has been gone. Yes!

818
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,890
Shit.

819
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,007
Hey, go ar--
Go around.

820
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,765
Fuck.

821
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,971
Come on, Mr. Dover.

822
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,204
Shit.

823
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,242
Why are you following me?

824
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,290
Get in the car.

825
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,243
Why are you following me?

826
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,763
Where were you going just now?

827
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,329
I parked at the liquor store.
I have a bottle of liquor.

828
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,404
You're the shit-hot detective.
Work it out.

829
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,688
I actually meant before that.

830
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:00,162
You were walking in the opposite
direction across the parking lot.

831
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,290
Towards Campello Street.

832
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:14,969
Yeah, well, I haven't had a drink
in nine and a half years.

833
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,806
Figured if I walked around
the parking lot a while...

834
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,566
...by the time they opened
I'd stop wanting it that bad.

835
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:25,442
And then I saw you.
Sort of helped me make up my mind.

836
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,968
There's a bag of lye in your basement
that's half empty.

837
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,810
Your wife thinks you've
been helping us...

838
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,641
...but we both know that's not true.

839
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,291
I used the lye to bury
our dog last year.

840
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,842
And "helping the cops" sounds better than
"I've been driving aimlessly in my truck...

841
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,241
...because I don't know
what the fuck else to do."

842
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,767
Is that what you were doing
last Saturday night?

843
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,090
Probably. Am I a suspect?

844
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:05,325
No, I'm only asking because you
assaulted a man who's now missing.

845
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,002
I heard about that. What happened?
Thought you had him under surveillance.

846
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,004
I'm gonna assume you're asking me
because you have no idea.

847
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,165
- Didn't think it was something I'd get away with.
- It's not.

848
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,210
It couldn't be he skipped town
because the asshole is guilty.

849
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,682
Couldn't be that. Because that would
mean it would be your fault, right?

850
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,569
Mr. Dover?

851
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,208
- Mr. Dover?
- What?

852
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,011
You need to take care of yourself
and your wife.

853
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:38,004
That's the best thing
you can do right now.

854
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:42,207
That little girl is gonna need you
when she comes home.

855
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,803
Kids gone for more than a week have
half as good a chance of being found...

856
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,043
...and after a month, almost none are.
Not alive. All right?

857
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,248
So forgive me for doing
everything I can--

858
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,528
You know what?
It hasn't been a fucking week.

859
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,401
- You're right. It's day fucking six! Day six!
- Hasn't been a week.

860
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,724
And every day she's wondering why
I'm not there to fucking rescue her!

861
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,611
- All right.
- Do you understand that? Me! Not you!

862
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,081
Not you! But me!

863
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,730
- Every day!
- All right.

864
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,847
So forgive me for not going home
to have a good night's rest!

865
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,401
Now, why don't you look for my
fucking daughter rather than fighting--?

866
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,206
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

867
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,567
- Don't follow me.
- Hey. Hey.

868
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,927
Mr. Dover. Mr. Dover.

869
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,922
Don't think I'd let you get behind the
wheel after you've been drinking, do you?

870
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,129
I'm gonna walk.
You look for my daughter.

871
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,051
Daddy.

872
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,804
Daddy.

873
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,485
Look, Daddy, we found it.

874
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,766
Anna, where was it?

875
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,762
I'm not Alex.

876
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,121
I'm not Alex.

877
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,088
What? What are you saying? What?

878
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,607
- What?
- I'm...

879
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,406
I'm not Alex.

880
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,962
- What, you're not Alex? What?
- I'm not Alex.

881
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,043
Just a--

882
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,802
I don't understand. Just talk to me.

883
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,407
I waited and he never came.

884
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:05,281
Come on. No more riddles.
Just fucking tell me.

885
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,046
He never came. I just...

886
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:12,962
I'll let you go home to your aunt
if you tell me where they are.

887
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,487
I just wanted to play.

888
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,290
Don't make me do this to you.

889
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,602
- And he never came.
- What were you doing?

890
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,603
He never came. I just wanted to--

891
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,007
Why are you making me do this?

892
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,763
Help me, God.

893
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:59,243
I'm relying on your almighty power
and your infinite mercies and promises.

894
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,609
I hope to obtain pardon for my sins.

895
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,243
Fuck me.

896
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,241
No noise. You shut up.

897
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,131
You make any noise,
I'm gonna turn on that tap.

898
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,890
Hey, rise and shine.

899
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,811
I'm not gonna find two girls here, am I?

900
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,644
Fuck you.

901
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,081
What about Alex Jones?

902
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,004
What about him?

903
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,164
I came here to drink. I don't want
to drink in front of my wife.

904
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,610
Look, my father left me
this building, all right?

905
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,328
You mind giving me a tour?

906
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:29,011
- Why didn't you tell me about this place?
- I didn't think it mattered.

907
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,409
Everything matters.

908
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,288
It's all pretty much like this.
I'm gonna renovate soon.

909
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:43,604
Yeah. Not as organized
as your basement, huh?

910
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,931
What's up with all the survivor gear
in there?

911
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,330
Pray for the best,
prepare for the worst.

912
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,209
At least we agree there.

913
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,164
Come on, hurry up.

914
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,730
Oh, shit.

915
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,320
Hello?

916
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,850
The guy you were looking for was just here.
He saw me watching him and ran.

917
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,331
You get a plate?

918
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:55,405
Yeah.

919
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,245
Yeah.

920
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,165
Yeah.

921
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,288
Go home, Mr. Dover.

922
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,731
Hi.

923
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,005
Morning.

924
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,487
Why'd you run away from me
the other night?

925
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,847
I've never seen you before.

926
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,682
You sure you have the right house?

927
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,604
You doing some shopping
at the Value Mall lately?

928
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,648
Yeah. Ahem.

929
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,121
Why, is it a crime to shop there?

930
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,284
I can't afford to buy suits
from Brooks Brothers.

931
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,323
Yeah, I know.

932
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,448
You bought children's clothes.

933
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,650
Did I?

934
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,043
Must've been in a hurry.

935
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,731
Mm-hm.

936
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:33,450
Do you have children?

937
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,891
No.

938
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,930
I don't have...

939
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,609
Have anything--

940
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,522
Come on! Christ!

941
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,290
Come here. Come here.

942
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,371
Stay.

943
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,330
If you move, I'll put a bullet
through your fucking head.

944
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,487
This is 13-40. I need additional unit
for search. 437 Carrol Street.

945
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,411
Possible kidnapping victims
on the premises.

946
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:25,128
Anna? Fucking...

947
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,724
Anna? Joy?

948
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,484
Fuck.

949
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:41,891
Fuck.

950
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,521
Aah! Fuck!

951
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,009
Ah, fuck.

952
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:28,041
So we've taken photographs of some of
the clothing we found in the suspect's house.

953
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,929
Mr. Dover.

954
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,121
Mr. Dover, is your wife here?

955
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:28,009
She's not coming.

956
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,131
If you can't make a positive ID
on these photographs...

957
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,090
...I'm gonna need her to come in
and take a look at them.

958
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,204
Have a seat.

959
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:57,004
So he confessed?
He said he killed them?

960
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,203
We were hoping he was lying, but...

961
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:04,528
We haven't even found
any bodies, Mr. Dover, but...

962
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:11,886
...the Birches positively identified
two pieces of clothing.

963
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:17,728
So I'm gonna need you to tell me
if you recognize anything.

964
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,811
No.

965
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,404
Uh...

966
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:54,529
I'm not sure. I don't know.

967
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,125
Okay.

968
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,685
No.

969
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,406
No--

970
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,450
That's her...

971
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,289
That's her sock.

972
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,925
You...

973
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,529
You wasted time.

974
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,006
You wasted time following me.

975
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,722
You let this happen.

976
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,888
Don't talk to them.

977
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,168
Eliza told me they're dead.

978
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,486
- Is it true?
- No.

979
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,325
She said they found their
bloody clothes--

980
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:24,882
Don't you dare tell your mother that.
Don't you dare, you understand me?

981
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:27,801
Now, I need you to listen to me.

982
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:31,681
I need you to stay for a couple of days.
Make sure she does not watch the news.

983
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,571
When the paper comes,
throw it the fuck away. Listen to me!

984
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:37,769
We do not give up on your sister!
We do not!

985
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,848
I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna bring
her home. We do not give up.

986
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,924
You're gonna bring her home?
She's dead. You can't do anything.

987
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:48,243
You leave me and Mom here while you
go out, getting fucking drunk!

988
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,768
- You think I can't smell on you?
- Shut up!

989
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:15,802
How long has this
Bob Taylor been working...

990
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,729
...on this map?

991
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,123
Three and a half hours.

992
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:23,284
Think this is gonna lead
to the bodies? I sure as shit don't.

993
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,125
Do me a favor, captain.
Go fuck yourself.

994
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,806
We weren't getting anywhere
questioning him.

995
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,369
That looks more
like a maze than a map.

996
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,483
He's got a thing for mazes.

997
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:44,200
I'm going home.
Call me if something happens.

998
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,364
Give me that card, John.
The key card.

999
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,008
All right, it's done now.

1000
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:46,049
Tell me what you're drawing.

1001
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,126
You said you're drawing a map.
That looks like a puzzle.

1002
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,089
You tell me what you're drawing.

1003
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:59,288
Tell me what you're drawing.

1004
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,967
- I can't!
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

1005
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,849
- Yes, you can.
- Oh, shit!

1006
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,401
Yes, you can! Yes, you can!

1007
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,643
- Take him! Come on!
- Yes, you can! Yes, he can!

1008
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,608
Oh, shit! Gun! Gun! Gun!

1009
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,683
Bob, don't!
Put the gun down!

1010
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:22,803
Bob. Bob, put the gun down! Bob.
Bob,no!

1011
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,490
No! No, no, no!

1012
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:29,210
Fuck.

1013
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:34,041
Go call a fucking R.A.!

1014
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:38,366
<i>Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1015
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,202
Thy kingdom come...

1016
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,481
...thy will be done...

1017
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:47,086
...on earth as it is in heaven.

1018
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:53,009
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

1019
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,450
...as we--

1020
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,884
As we for--

1021
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,124
He explain this before
he ate the bullet?

1022
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,284
I'm sorry.

1023
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:41,965
Fuck your sorry.
Save it for the girls' parents.

1024
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,162
I don't know what to do, Alex.

1025
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,042
I don't know what to do anymore.

1026
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,923
And what's completely fucked up about all
this is I know you know where they are.

1027
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,203
I think we're done.

1028
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:10,043
They're in the maze.

1029
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:15,084
- That's where you'll find them.
- What?

1030
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,329
What did you say?

1031
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,445
In the maze.

1032
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:28,607
What--? What maze? Where is it?
Where is the maze? Where do I find it?

1033
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:30,285
Alex?

1034
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,046
Alex, listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1035
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:36,362
Okay? Just tell me where the maze is.

1036
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,163
Just tell me, man.

1037
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,446
Where is the maze?

1038
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:47,962
Come on, tell me.
Just tell me where the maze is, okay?

1039
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,051
Come on, don't fuck with me.
Don't fuck with me now.

1040
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,727
Don't fuck with me, goddamn it.
Tell me where they are!

1041
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:00,487
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

1042
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,084
Something's gonna get to you, man.

1043
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:09,723
Something's gonna get to you!
Something's gonna get to you!

1044
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:33,209
Just a minute!

1045
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,449
- Can I help you?
- Morning, ma'am.

1046
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,125
Uh...

1047
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,924
I'm Keller Dover.

1048
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,608
My little girl was
abducted with a friend.

1049
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,404
What do you want?

1050
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,090
Uh...

1051
01:48:56,280 --> 01:49:00,046
I guess I haven't thought
this through too good, huh? I...

1052
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,003
I been thinking a lot about
what happened to your nephew.

1053
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,801
And I know I scared him the other day
at the police station, and...

1054
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,126
What I'm trying to say is I kind of feel
responsible for him running away.

1055
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:19,481
You wanna come on in?

1056
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,165
Yeah.

1057
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:36,170
My husband and I were
very devout at one time.

1058
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:42,168
Spent our summers driving around
in that camper with our son...

1059
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,327
...handing out pamphlets.

1060
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,921
Spreading the good word.

1061
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,888
After our son died of cancer...

1062
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,925
...we started seeing things differently.

1063
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,162
Adopting Alex helped...

1064
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,281
...but we never got over it.

1065
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:06,970
I'm sorry.

1066
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,166
You look very tired.

1067
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:16,567
Yeah, I don't sleep much.

1068
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,324
I, uh...

1069
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,204
I keep dreaming about
being lost in a maze.

1070
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,962
I'm sorry. Heh.

1071
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,801
Alex never talks very much...

1072
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,043
...so when people come over here,
I hardly know what to say.

1073
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,247
He doesn't talk much?

1074
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,728
Well, he talks. Good morning,
good night, that sort of thing.

1075
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,804
Hard to get too much
more than that out of him.

1076
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,402
Had an accident when he was little.

1077
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:51,531
After that he started choosing his words
a little too carefully.

1078
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:55,048
- What--? What kind of accident did he--?
- Oh.

1079
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,240
My husband kept snakes.

1080
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,803
It wasn't that bad what happened,
but Alex had a fear of them and...

1081
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,921
That's not my favorite memory.

1082
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,684
I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

1083
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,610
Oh.

1084
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:17,048
Can I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Dover?

1085
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,161
Oh.

1086
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:27,762
Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you
would have known about that already.

1087
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:31,411
I say it's better this way.
You know, that awful man...

1088
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:36,646
...he would have spent years on Death Row
just watching TV and getting fat.

1089
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,290
Well.

1090
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,968
Least I don't have to worry
about losing you to P.S.P.

1091
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:57,287
When forensics is finished with the guy's
place, we're gonna deploy the cadaver dogs.

1092
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:01,005
Look, kid, we can't always save the day.

1093
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,201
All right?
We're just cops. Janitors.

1094
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,127
So you lost this one, all right?

1095
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:11,721
Look, you want fulfillment,
you need to find a girl.

1096
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:14,326
You know?
Start a family, have some kids.

1097
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,609
<i>Let it go.</i>

1098
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,845
Right.

1099
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:50,324
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, it's Rich. We found something.</i>

1100
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:55,242
Guys, let us have a look.

1101
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:03,766
Two kid-sized department store
mannequins, with their heads caved in.

1102
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:08,050
I talked to our lab. They told me the blood
we sampled from the plastic containers?

1103
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,850
Pig's blood.

1104
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:14,765
Let's get this covered up. It's
supposed to snow soon. Hurry up, okay?

1105
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:19,841
It's like he's play-acting.
Case in point:

1106
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,685
Except for the items ID'd
by the Dovers and the Birches...

1107
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,923
...all the kids' clothes that we found
still had tags on them.

1108
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,447
And that maze book that we found,
he made it.

1109
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:31,285
Photocopies, pictures from this book
we found in the attic.

1110
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:34,887
- Ex-FBI agent wrote that.
- "Finding the Invisible Man."

1111
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:39,125
It's about a theoretical suspect he believed
was responsible for a bunch of abductions.

1112
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,966
It's totally discredited,
I guess, but I read some of it.

1113
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:46,488
Taylor was abducted when he was a kid.
He ran away after three weeks.

1114
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:49,883
The captor drugged him on some
sort of LSD/Ketamine cocktail.

1115
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,566
He never remembered
and they never caught the guy.

1116
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:57,567
Okay, so, he read the book and decided
he was taken by the Invisible Man.

1117
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:00,769
Now he's doing his
best imitation, right?

1118
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:06,971
Yeah, he was doing his best imitation.
He killed himself last night.

1119
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,127
How did he do that?
I thought he was in custody.

1120
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,331
Hey.

1121
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,641
Taylor drew this.
It's a map to the bodies.

1122
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:22,165
It's a map to the bodies.

1123
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,324
We found the same design
on a pendant we pulled off that corpse.

1124
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,682
- There's a connection, okay?
- Connection is...

1125
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,367
...that it's the last maze in the book.
It's unsolvable. There's no way out.

1126
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:35,081
Your corpse is another wannabe,
read the book.

1127
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,604
What are you saying to me, Rich?
What?

1128
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,922
What are you saying,
that this guy is a fake?

1129
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,084
You're saying that the girls
are still out there somewhere?

1130
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:45,163
How did Bob Taylor
get those clothes?

1131
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:48,130
How did--?
How did the parents...

1132
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:50,886
...positively ID those clothes?

1133
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,803
That I can't reconcile.

1134
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,200
You can't reconcile that?

1135
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:59,489
Just keep knocking on doors,
looking in windows.

1136
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:01,848
Hey, why is that there? Bag that.

1137
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,162
Will do, sir. Right away.

1138
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,205
Yes?

1139
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,765
Yeah, this is she.

1140
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,411
What?

1141
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:48,370
Oh, my God.

1142
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:51,729
Wait. Is she--?

1143
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,650
Ralph! Keller!

1144
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:12,761
Keller! We need to go to the hospital!

1145
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,321
They found Joy, but not Anna!
They didn't find Anna!

1146
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,763
Maybe she'll know where Anna is!
Please, we have to go!

1147
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:20,331
Keller!

1148
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,401
Eliza's not picking up.

1149
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:28,040
- You should text her.
- Yeah.

1150
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:39,526
- Nobody gets beyond this point.
- Don't touch me.

1151
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:42,160
- Miss! Wait a minute--
- It's okay.

1152
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,524
- Nancy.
- Grace.

1153
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:47,200
They'll find Anna. I know they will.
I know they will.

1154
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,362
I know.

1155
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:52,451
- How is she?
- Is she awake?

1156
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:55,802
Joy, were you far from our street?

1157
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:59,089
How far from the street
were you, Joy? Joy?

1158
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,720
- You can't be doing this.
- How long did it take you--?

1159
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,689
- Let me ask a question!
- Keller!

1160
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,730
The detective will be back in just a minute.
You need to wait.

1161
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,690
- She's been drugged.
- Joy.

1162
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,641
Sweetheart, just let us
know she's alive, okay?

1163
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:18,402
Can you just nod your head, baby?
Just nod your head?

1164
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:23,088
Baby? Can you give us a nod?
Can you nod your head for us, please?

1165
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,765
Joy?

1166
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,931
Joy.

1167
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:10,329
You were there.

1168
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:14,564
What? I--?
I was where?

1169
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:19,449
- It put tape on our mouths.
- Shh.

1170
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,526
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

1171
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,687
It's okay. It's okay.

1172
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,806
Mommy and Daddy are here now,
okay? You're all right.

1173
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:33,247
- Excuse me.
- You're all right now.

1174
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:36,371
I said nobody's allowed in that room
but her family.

1175
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,966
- Hey! Where you going?
- Keller?

1176
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:42,010
- Hey! Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1177
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,686
Hey! Call downstairs. Don't let him go.

1178
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,008
Hey! Hey!

1179
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:48,845
Hey!

1180
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:53,087
Stop that car! Get his truck!

1181
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:55,208
Stop it! Hey!

1182
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:20,360
I've got you, you fucker.

1183
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,608
I know where you're going.

1184
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:25,050
I know where you're going.

1185
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:44,441
Hello again.

1186
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:49,761
Hey. I was hoping you'd
let me do some penance.

1187
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:55,210
- For what?
- Scaring you the other day at the, uh...

1188
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:58,443
- At the police station.
- You already apologized for that.

1189
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:02,122
I know, I was just--
You know, I thought maybe you, uh...

1190
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:05,041
You could use some
help around the--

1191
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:08,807
I noticed your door here needs fixing,
so I brought my tools and, uh...

1192
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:12,567
Oh. I see.

1193
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:18,524
I burned myself.
Feel a little icky today.

1194
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:23,362
But I'm glad you want to talk some more.

1195
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:28,686
No need to make excuses.
You come on in and make me a cup of tea.

1196
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:39,690
Come on in.

1197
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,441
I don't want to have to hurt you.

1198
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:05,848
I know they were here.

1199
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:10,883
Put your hands on your head
and turn around.

1200
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,050
Do it.

1201
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,044
I'm just gonna go.

1202
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:24,047
Don't touch that bag.
Put your hands on your head.

1203
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:31,769
Come over here to this counter.
Come on.

1204
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,884
Top drawer.

1205
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,405
Open it.

1206
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:53,204
Mm-hm.

1207
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:56,489
Put them on.

1208
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:09,244
You don't know me, Mr. Dover.

1209
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,445
But believe me when I tell you,
I won't let you go.

1210
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,609
You don't have to drink all of it.

1211
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:28,247
About a third should do for
a man your size.

1212
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:32,730
- Something to make you more manageable.
- Forget it.

1213
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:35,184
Drink it, Mr. Dover, or
I'll kill you right here

1214
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:37,473
in my kitchen and bring
your daughter in here...

1215
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,874
...and have her scrub your
brains off the floor.

1216
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:40,595
- Where is she?

1217
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:45,286
Drink.

1218
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,569
Just let me see her.

1219
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:49,449
- You want to see her?
- Yes.

1220
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:52,965
That's your ticket
to your daughter right there.

1221
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:07,366
Little more, Mr. Dover.
Little more.

1222
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:15,089
Good, isn't it?

1223
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:18,161
That's my darling husband's recipe.

1224
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,684
Now go on out back.

1225
02:06:28,160 --> 02:06:30,083
Let me see her.

1226
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,648
Take it out of your pocket.

1227
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,684
Put it in the sink.

1228
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:46,362
Put it in the disposal.

1229
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:56,842
Put your car keys on the table.

1230
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:02,970
Put your car keys on the table.

1231
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,410
That's right.

1232
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:11,410
Go over to the Trans-Am over there.
The car over there. Come on, move it.

1233
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:13,364
Get over there.

1234
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:22,887
The look on your face.

1235
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:27,887
My husband used to have the very
same look until we took Alex.

1236
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:30,008
He was the first kid we ever took.

1237
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:33,886
His name was Jimmy. Or Barry.

1238
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:36,560
Can't remember.
Doubt he can, either.

1239
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:38,768
So many names.

1240
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:43,522
Forgot all about Bobby Taylor
until I read about him in the paper.

1241
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:47,767
Get in the driver's seat.

1242
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:59,606
Open the door and get in the car.

1243
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:19,367
Making children disappear
is the war we wage with God.

1244
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:23,086
Makes people lose their faith.

1245
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:26,130
Turns them into demons like you.

1246
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:31,080
Had to slow down
since my husband disappeared.

1247
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,322
But I do what I can.

1248
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,724
Start the car.

1249
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,283
Start the car.

1250
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:46,649
Keep trying.

1251
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:55,330
Back up. Slowly.

1252
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:02,563
Come on. Back up.

1253
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,010
Come on.

1254
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:11,165
Stop.

1255
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:12,845
Turn it off.

1256
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:15,483
Turn it off!

1257
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:18,250
Get out.

1258
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:29,284
Think you should know.

1259
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:31,841
Alex never laid a hand on those girls.

1260
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,571
Just wanted to take them
for a ride in the camper.

1261
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:38,045
I was the one who decided
they should stay.

1262
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,044
Take a look.

1263
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,688
Maybe your daughter's under there.

1264
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:48,964
You never know.

1265
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,010
Anna.

1266
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:54,330
Anna!

1267
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:01,041
Anna?

1268
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:04,727
Anna! Anna! Anna!

1269
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:09,690
I had the girls down there
while the police came poking around.

1270
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:12,249
Should have left them down there.

1271
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:15,050
I was so lonely without Alex.

1272
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:20,644
- Now get in there.
- What?

1273
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:23,049
Get in.

1274
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:29,244
You want me to get in there,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

1275
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,321
I'm not gonna get in there
just because you asked.

1276
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:37,925
God!

1277
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:46,643
Go on. Get in there.

1278
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,365
That's right.

1279
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:17,441
Make yourself a tourniquet.

1280
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:20,407
Just might last 24 hours.

1281
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:29,810
I'd love for you to still be alive when
I dump your daughter's body down there.

1282
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:37,962
Wait. No, wait, wait! Wait!

1283
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:44,885
Oh.

1284
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:10,964
Hey. I need you to go
over to Holly Jones'.

1285
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:13,566
- She needs to be notified.
- No. I need to find Dover.

1286
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:16,929
- Come on. You're done with Dover.
- You want me to go to Holly Jones'?

1287
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:20,163
I want you to go to Holly Jones'
and notify her, please.

1288
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:30,805
Pfft.

1289
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:53,085
Oh, God.

1290
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:54,082
Almighty God, protect my girl.

1291
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:08,730
Mrs. Jones?

1292
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:22,289
Mrs. Jones?

1293
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:55,131
Show me your hands right now.

1294
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:58,886
Don't move and show me
your fucking hands right now.

1295
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:02,330
Stop right now!
Show me your fucking hands.

1296
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:04,648
Do not move and show me your hands.

1297
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:09,408
Make sure they cremate me. I sure as hell
don't want to be buried in some box.

1298
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:11,608
Both hands! Right now! Right now!

1299
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:15,365
Fuck!

1300
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:28,325
Anna.

1301
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,769
Oh, my God.

1302
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:52,606
Anna.

1303
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:10,369
Oh, shit.

1304
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,042
Come on. Come on, Anna.

1305
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,406
Anna. Come on.

1306
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:37,643
Stay with me, Anna. Stay with me, huh?

1307
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:40,084
Stay with me, Anna.

1308
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:51,642
Stay with me, Anna! It's all right.
It's all right, come on.

1309
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:53,171
Go, move, move, move!

1310
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:04,603
Don't die. Don't die.

1311
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:33,530
It's okay. It's okay.

1312
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:37,367
Honey. You're okay.

1313
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:39,807
Hey. Hey.

1314
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:42,442
Hey! Help!

1315
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,248
Help! Help.

1316
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:48,643
Help! Help!

1317
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:11,765
Um, Detective Loki?

1318
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,650
I hope we're not intruding.

1319
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:18,921
No.

1320
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:25,761
She's doing real good.

1321
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:30,001
She's gonna be up and around
in a few days, aren't you, buddy?

1322
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:34,370
She just wanted to come and say
thank you and hi to her hero.

1323
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:40,965
Hello.

1324
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:51,764
Would you mind giving me a minute?

1325
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:55,568
- Yeah. Say goodbye, Joy.
- Thank you.

1326
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:58,564
- Bye.
- I'll be out in a minute. Say goodbye, Anna.

1327
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:27,168
She found her whistle?

1328
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:29,880
No.

1329
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,686
She keeps insisting
that Joy helped her find it...

1330
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:35,571
...on Thanksgiving
before they were taken.

1331
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:38,451
But I think she's just confused.

1332
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:40,930
I got her a new one.

1333
02:21:58,320 --> 02:22:00,721
He hasn't contacted me.

1334
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,450
I know you don't...

1335
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:08,524
I know you probably don't believe that,
but he hasn't.

1336
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:17,768
I believe you.

1337
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:27,762
Do you think you're gonna find him?

1338
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:33,485
Yeah.

1339
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:36,489
And he'll go to jail.

1340
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:40,485
Probably.

1341
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:46,045
Anyway.

1342
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:49,163
Thank you for everything.

1343
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:54,202
Oh, God.

1344
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,489
I miss him.

1345
02:23:11,320 --> 02:23:15,564
He-- He did what he had to do
to find Anna...

1346
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:17,449
...and I thank God for that.

1347
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:29,642
He's a good man.

1348
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:40,205
Bye.

1349
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:06,562
That's it. Let's pack it up.

1350
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:17,883
- You all done for the night?
- Yeah, the ground's frozen solid.

1351
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:21,243
It's gonna take weeks to excavate
the entire property.

1352
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:24,210
Just found some dead snakes and shit.

1353
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:29,084
Pray for the best,
prepare for the worst, yeah?

1354
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:32,531
Night.

1355
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:36,885
Night.

1356
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:39,251
Shut her down.

1357
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:41,090
Yeah, I got it.
