The Cook  The Thief
His Wife & Her Lover
(1989)

1
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,749
Go and get the dogs.

2
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,457
Come on, then. Mews!

3
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:07,499
Come on, now. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth, eh?

4
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,415
Learn to appreciate your food, eh?

5
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:15,749
Compared to what you serve up
in that dirty little canteen of yours,

6
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,415
this is a three-star supper.

7
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,749
You must learn the rules.

8
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,415
I need to eat and drink the very best
and that's expensive.

9
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,624
Have you ever heard of <u>chicken â la Reine Marie</u>
(Queen's chicken: creamy sauce from veal knuckles broth
over arranged cut chicken)

10
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,790
or oyster <u>sauce mornay</u>
(white cheese sauce)

11
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,415
or frogs' legs <u>Parisienne</u>?
(of Paris, breaded and deep fried)

12
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,540
No. Course you haven't.

13
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,499
Take his pants down!
Take his pants down.

14
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,749
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

15
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,124
Didn't your daddy teach you
to wipe your bottom? Eh?

16
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,540
Albert! Leave him alone.

17
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,499
- Come on, let's eat.
- Oh, let's eat.

18
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,040
Before we eat, Georgina,
we must feed and water the animals.

19
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,874
Roy! This is my wife, Georgina Spica.

20
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,499
She's got a heart of gold
and a body to match.

21
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,040
I am Albert Spica and I have a heart of gold
and a great deal of money to match.

22
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:22,540
And you are Roy, who's got absolutely nothing,
except what you owe me.

23
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:28,415
You are humiliated in front of a lady,
you're humiliated in front of us.

24
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,540
Georgina,
I'll be as quick as I possibly can.

25
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:37,415
Gah... You, go and get me some hot water, eh?
And a towel and soap.

26
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,749
Now...

27
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,415
Yeah.

28
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:46,374
Now I've given you a good dinner
and you can have a nice drink.

29
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,749
Now, you behave yourself in future
and pay when I ask you.

30
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,915
- No, no, no...
- Or next time I'll make you eat your own shit

31
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,165
after forcing it through your dick
like toothpaste.

32
00:03:56,166 --> 00:04:00,999
No, put it back. Put that away, Spangler.
<u>Cor blimey</u>, there's a lady present.
(a Brit slang to express surprise)

33
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,165
She doesn't want to see
your shrivelled contributions.

34
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,165
Ah.

35
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,415
That's it.
Thank you very much.
Nice, clean...

36
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,999
Give me that towel!

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,290
Give me that. Yeah.

38
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:20,874
I never liked that Chinese food
but looking at you now,
I like it even less.

39
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,374
Righto, boys!

40
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,874
We must surprise Richard
on our anniversary.

41
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,999
Bring the letters.

42
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:34,874
Georgie, you got ash on your tits.
If you're gonna wear black, don't smoke.

43
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,499
- You look like a tart in black.
- It's blue.

44
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,249
It's black, and don't smoke.
It's sloppy in a woman.

45
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,582
No one who's going to eat smokes.

46
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:48,749
It ruins your taste buds, burns
your tongue and makes your pee stink.

47
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,249
- Rubbish.
- It's not bloody rubbish.

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,749
I've smelt the loo
after you've been piddling in there.

49
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,582

- He's plucking.
- He's plucking, eh? Richard!

61
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,082
Where are you?
Stop that plucking. Where are you?

62

Now what's that? A-S-P...

Bloody hell. Richard! Rich... Ah!

00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,249
There you are, Richard. Now...

66
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,499
Leave that out and come and see
what I've got you, eh?

67
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,249
I've brought you a present.
This is our anniversary.

68
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,957
Three months of mutual understanding,
eh, Richard?

69
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:43,499
Three months since I first invited you
to be my favourite restaurateur.

70
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,207
Mr. Spica, this is a duck.

71
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,749
Ducks are born with the feathers on

72
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,457
but it's your dinner, Mr. Spica.

73
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:57,457
If you want the feathers to remain,
we could try the dish,

74
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,874
I suppose, by leaving
the feathers as they are.

75
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,999
Canard en ses plumes torche.
(To cook the duck with the feathers on.)

76
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,124
Mitchel, you mule.

77
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,707
'Ere, Richard,
come and see, come on.

78
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,749
Please, I beg you. Ha! Come on.

79
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:20,499
Georgina, how many times have I told you?
No smoking in the kitchen.

80
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,457
Mitchel, get your arse down here quick.
Come on.

81
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:30,624
Now, Richard,
this is your... well, our new sign.

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,374
♪ Da-da-da-da-da-da! ♪

83
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,874

Oh, God!

85
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,874
Richard.

86
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,582
- It's dark in the restaurant.
- Yes, Phillipe.

87
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,874
Thanks to Mr. Spica's generosity,
it is dark everywhere.

88
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,082
No power, no light.

89
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:09,624
- Were you thinking of a cold buffet tonight?
- But I don't want a cold buffet.

90
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:15,374
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.
( Cold chicken with a somewhat bitter sauce. )
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.

91
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,749

Anchovies in garlic vinegar.

It doesn't have to be cold,
you've got gas, for God's sake!

95
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,999
Got an arse on her like
two greased watermelons in a sack.

96
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,540
Cold chicken, <u>paté d'alouettes</u>,
(seasoned finely minced liver/meat/fowl)

97
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:46,415
salade de langoustine (lobster salad),
gâteau de carottes et Gruyére...
(carrot cake and Gruyère cheese)...

98
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:51,540
You. You put them electrics right, Mitchel.
Put them electrics right or...

99
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:55,665
You don't eat.

100
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,165
I told you not to smoke.

101
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,999
I should stand still, Mr. Spica.
Or who knows?

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,540
You might spoil something,
put your foot in something.

103
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:14,290
So, a hot meal for tonight.
Something special, please. How about some...

104
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:18,915
some, er, les hors d'oeuvres (appetizer),
er, gâteau au poivres (pepper cakes/biscuits),

105
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:23,749
er, terrine et fillet lamb
et <u>poison</u> au er, poi, poi...

106
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,665
- It's <u>"poisson"</u> ("fish").
- What did you say, Georgie?

107
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,915
What did you say?
What did you say?

108
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,040
Poisson. (Fish.)

109
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,499
- Well, Mr. Spica, I hope you are hungry.
- Always. Get in there, boys.

110
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:52,415
Go on, Georgie, go in there,
raise your skirts and warm my seat.

111
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,499
Eh, what do you think then, eh?
What do you?

112
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:09,290
If you spent as much money
on the meal, Mr. Spica,

113
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,290
as you waste on the decor,

114
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:16,749
your taste in good food
must surely improve.

115
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:23,999
You'll cheek me once too often, Boarst.
You rely on me, don't forget that.

116
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,249
Without me, you, a foreigner,
you wouldn't last long around here.

117
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,124
Look out there,
see what I've brought you.

118
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,999
Two vans full of good stuff,
just right for your kitchen.

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,415
- I would not touch it.
- Why on earth not?

120
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:42,540
I insist on buying my own food,
Mr. Spica.

121
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:46,040
Then I can be sure of its quality.

122
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,790
I represent quality around here,
Boarst, my name is known for it.

123
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,540
I offer quality and protection.

124
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:58,249
Protection against what,
I wonder, Mr. Spica? And whom?

125
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,665
Protection, Boarst,
against the rash temper of my men.

126
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,915
Against a sudden arrival
of food poisoning.

127
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,915
Against rats.
Against the public health inspector.

128
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,540
If you are hungry tonight,
you are going to have to wait.

129
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,790
Do up the third button of your
expensive jacket, Mr. Spica.

130
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:28,665
You'll feel less empty inside,
Mr. Spica.

131
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,415

No, you don't eat it like that!
Let me show you.

149
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,540
Oh. Imagine you are sucking
the little fingers of a lady or...

150
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:57,999
No, you'd never get that close to a lady.
Who'd wanna get that close to you?

151
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,499
- I wouldn't be interested in her fingers.
- I'd expect you to say that.

152
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:07,040
You'd just whip it in, whip it out
and wipe it on your jacket.

153
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,124
Look at your jacket, it's like a pig field.

154
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,165
And your nails could do with a clean.
Show me.

155
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,874
Gawd. Why can't I have some bloody quality
in my associates?

156
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:23,665
From now on, anyone not properly dressed
for dinner will pay for it.

157
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,290
I'll write lessons down for you.
Georgina can type them out.

158
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,249
"Notes For Gourmets". That's French
for a good eater, isn't it, Boarst?

159
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,790
- Gourmets don't belch.
- On the contrary, on the contrary. They do.

160
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,999
It shows that you are enjoying a meal.

161
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,165
Not with your fingers, Spangler!
That's all you understand...

162
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,874
things you eat with your hands
whilst walking down the street.

163
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,040
You told Mews to eat the celery
with his fingers.

164
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:56,415
That's different, you dope.
And it's asparagus, not celery.

165
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:02,165
What's the point of sinking thousands into
a restaurant if you refuse to eat properly?

166
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,415
- Tell him, Georgina.
- Tell him what?

167
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:10,999
Just copy Georgina. She knows how to do it.
Cory, get Richard in here.

168
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:15,999
I want my sign fixed up
and put on that wall over the kitchen door.

169
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,374
If Richard was more interested in slogans,
he'd make more money, eh?

170
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,915
This place is too dark.

171
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,540
Could do with a respray.
Gold, it needs more gold.

172
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,165
How about gold and blue?

173
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,624
What do you think, Henry?
10,000 should do it - two months' takings.

174
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,290
You should get in there.
Boarst's prices are all over the place.

175
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:44,874
His head's in the clouds. Good cook.
Brilliant cook!

176
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:49,415
Except he puts mushrooms on everything.
Henry, put that cigarette out.

177
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,040
Do you mind if I eat whilst you smoke?

178
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:57,540
Gordon choked on a cigarette whilst eating -
burnt his epiglottis.

179
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,374
Mitchel, you've got one.
And you don't keep it in your trousers.

180
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:08,290
You don't put orange rind on the edge
of your plate, it goes there, you dolt!

181
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:13,999
What you've got to realise is that
a clever cook puts unlikely things together

182
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:18,040
like duck and orange, like pineapple and ham.

183
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,165
It's called artistry.

184
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:24,499
I'm an artist, the way I combine
my business and my pleasure.

185
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,999
Money's my business,
eating's my pleasure.

186
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,165
And Georgie's my pleasure too,
though in a more private kind of way

187
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:35,290
than stuffing the mouth
and feeding the sewers.

188
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,540
Though the pleasures are related,

189
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:42,999
because the naughty bits and the dirty bits
are so close together

190
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:48,790
that it just goes to show
how eating and sex are related.

191
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,915
Georgie's naughty bits are nicely related,
aren't they, Georgie?

192
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,915
Especially when she's
paying me attention. Georgie!

193
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:02,999
Get Phillipe! In future, I want my
table napkins folded at home, Georgina.
Get Adele to teach you.

194
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,374
Spangler, get up and get Phillipe.

195
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:11,249
Bring Richard here,
I've got to make him a proposition.

196
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,374
Get Adele to get some of that water with
the <u>angostura bitters</u> in it
(concentrated alcoholic liquor flavored with herbal essences)

197
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:19,874
and some lemon in the water and
a bowl of ice water to wash me fingers...

198
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,374
Henry! Give me those glasses off that table.
And the flowers.

199
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,499
This should look
the most important table here.

200
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,082
I like a load of glasses around,
it highers the tone.

201
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:51,624
- What's that?
- For Madame Spica, compliments of the house.

202
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,832
She's no Madame.
Why haven't I got one?

203
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,749
- I doubt, Mr. Spica, if you'll like it.
- Try me.

204
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:04,374
We have grown accustomed to you
being a conservative eater.

205
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,874
That's not true.
I'm as adventurous as the next.

206
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,124
Your wife has an excellent palate,
Mr. Spica.

207
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,999
It is always a pleasure
for us to serve her.

208
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:04,249
I want one of those hot, damp towels,
Richard, served to me with tongs.

209
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,374
Adele is no good with cash and figures.
She's just decorative, all lips and tits.

210
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,749
- We'll replace her.
- Can I do the replacing?

211
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,499
Stuff your mouth, Mitchel. Every time you open it,
you just show how vulgar you can be.

212
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,999
Georgina! Welcome back.

213
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,874
Did you wipe the seat
before you parked your bum?

214
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:05,707
You never know what you can catch these days.
Every toilet seat is a minefield.

215
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,124
That's for you. Richard thought I might like
to taste it, personal compliments of the chef.

216
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,749
Eat it.
I didn't fancy it, it smelt off.

217
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,999
Iris got a canker on her bum
from sitting on a loo seat.

218
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,499
The mechanic across the road poured
battery acid down the WC to clear it.

219
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,249
Some of it splashed on the seat.
Iris ran screaming into the street,

220
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,457
her backside hissing.

221
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,499
She hasn't been the same since.

222
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,624
She strips the same but never
with her back to the audience.

223
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:45,082
She had to change her act.
Now it's more full-frontal.

224
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,374
- Where are you going?
- I left my lighter in the toilet.

225
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,249
- Gawd's sake. You don't need it.
- I need it.

226
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,249
Richard, I'm going to ban smoking in here.
Tomorrow, the signs are going up.

227
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,999
You want to thicken your French accent
up a bit, mate,

228
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,374
like you've just come over from Paris.

229
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,999
Give them a bit of that ooh-la-la stuff.
Bit more of that <u>"Parlez-vous français?"</u>
("Do you speak French?")

230
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,457
Then you would not understand me,
Mr. Spica.

231
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:14,499
I don't know. I've always been able
to understand French letters.

232
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,124
Georgina!

233
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,582
What the hell are you doing in here?

234
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,624
Georgina?

235
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:04,957
You've been in here for ages.
What are you doing, having a baby?

236
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,249
I'm, er, I'm just...

237
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,874
- I'm just having a quiet smoke.
- Smoke?

238
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,624
You know how you hate me smoking
at the table.

239
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,249
Gawd's sake, Georgina.

240
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,082
Why tell me lies
about a lost lighter?

241
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:27,999
I didn't, I left it here
on the ledge in front of the mirror.

242
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,624
I'll be out in a few moments.

243
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:37,207
Don't hang around the ladies,
you'll embarrass the customers.

244
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,624
Show me the lighter.

245
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,999
There.

246
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,707
Do you want a cigarette as well?

247
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,207
Don't be so bloody stupid.

248
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:53,249
What are you doing in there,
Georgina, eh?

249
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,749
You playing with yourself?

250
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:00,249
That's not allowed, that's my property.
You're not allowed to fiddle with it.

251
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,624
- Shut up, Albert.
- Let me in, I'll show you how to wipe yourself.

252
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:09,249
Go away. I'll be out in a minute.

253
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,499
Well, don't be long.

254
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,499
I'll order you some <u>gâteau au poivres</u>.
(pepper cakes/biscuits)

255
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,749
Some <u>profiteroles</u>.
(cream puff)

256
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,999
And wash your hands.

257
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,999
You don't know the women
who use this place.

258
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,457
You took your time.

259
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,999
I thought you'd like me
to wait for you.

260
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,207
You smell nice and sweaty.

261
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,624
Wash your hands,
I'll give you a kiss.

262
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,999
You know what they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

263
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:18,374
What do they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

264
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,999
- They're asking to have their illusions shattered.
- Yeah.

265
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,374
You hold no illusions for me,
Georgie, eh?

266
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,832
No stone's been left unturned.

267
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,374
Look, just go order my
<u>profiteroles</u> (cream puff), will you?

268
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:38,874
Come on.

269
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:26,124
I think these Ethiopians like starving.

270
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:32,374
It keeps them slim and graceful, with those
big heads and dreamy eyes. You know those kids.

271
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,124
- You're sick.
- I might well be if you're being so priggish.

272
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:42,999
What do you know, Georgina, about
the starving? You can have anything you want.

273
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:48,374
- Where you been? You're late.
- It's Friday night. There's a lot of money about.

274
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,499
A decent man needs gloves to touch this stuff.
Let's have a look.

275
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,832
That's just what this restaurant needs.

276
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,374
Start laying them out.

277
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:04,124
What's the matter, Mitchel?
Don't you like mussels?

278
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:07,374
You got to learn to like them
if you're going to eat with me.

279
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,249
Don't you dare throw up in here!

280
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,874
Or I'll get Spangler to stuff 'em
back down your throat.

281
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:19,582
From the Malay restaurant.
The food poisoning scared them, they're paying up.

282
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,082
I'm sure they don't need
our assistance with that.

283
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:26,624
That stuff they eat,
they'd poison themselves with it.

284
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,749
Some of them Indians are well known
for drinking their own pee.

285
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,874
The same water
would go round and round.

286
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:39,499
Of course, you're bound to lose some
through evaporation.

287
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:44,249
Then you'd have to top it up.
Whose pee would you drink first?

288
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,582
- Erm...
- Me, I'd have a ready supply, wouldn't I?

289
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:51,332
Georgie and I have
our little sessions when we...

290
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,707
Good God, what have you got there?

291
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:58,332
Even you are getting compliments
from the chef, are you?

292
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,999
Being a guinea pig
for a Boarst experiment, are we?

293
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,332
Good God, looks like, er,
food for constipated French rabbits.

294
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:13,249
Albert, why don't you order me some <u>Chianti</u>?
You know I like <u>Chianti</u> (wine from central Tuscany).

295
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,249
In the bottle with the wrapping around it.

296
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,582
Then I can take it home
and hang it on the wall.

297
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:23,374
- Grace, haven't you got enough of them already?
- No.

298
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,874
Where the hell are you going?

299
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:29,332
- To the toilet.
- You haven't had anything to drink yet.

300
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:33,749
She's got a bladder like a leaky marrow.
Don't be long!

301
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,999
- You've upset her.
- Rubbish.

302
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,999
Don't be long! You're so talkative tonight,
we couldn't stand the silence without you.

303
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,499
Wash your hands!

304
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,582
[ In Italian ]
- Questo, questo. (This, this.)
- Cazzo. (Fuck.)

305
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:11,499
Dove hai imparto a cucinare? É velenoso.
(Where did you learn to cook? This taste like shit.)

306
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,707
Vieni qua. (Come here.)

307
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,749
That's off!

308
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:58,040
Uh.

309
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:02,040
- This custard's salty.
- It is sauce Hollandaise.

310
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:04,165
Can I help you, Mr. Spica?

311
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:07,540
I've come about those little
special complimentary dishes.

312
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:11,415
In future, I want all the guests
at my table shall receive them.

313
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,290
Why is my fish taking so long?

314
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,499
You can carry it in yourself,
if you like, Mr. Spica.

315
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:22,540
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. You bring it.

316
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:27,499
- You would not be looking for your wife?
- No, of course not.

317
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,749
Mr. Spica,
I have something to show you.

318
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:48,874
- What is this?
- New cutlery. Give your restaurant some style.

319
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:53,540
I brought in 300 sets.
My men are just re-laying the tables.

320
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,790
Not very good quality,
Mr. Spica.

321
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,540
You could use them at home,
Mr. Spica.

322
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:07,165
All 300 of them.

323
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,749
Where have you been?
Wiping your bum?

324
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,290
Did you use your left hand
like I showed you?

325
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,999
Where'd you get this stuff, Mews?
It's rubbish, falling apart.

326
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,874
Take 'em back.
Get a 150% refund. God.

327
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:04,999
What are you eating, Georgie?
Not much.

328
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:09,790
Ha! I see others in this restaurant
get the same special attentions.

329
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:15,040
What is it? Looks like
some sort of... watery salade.

330
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,749
That's not up to much.

331
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,915
Expensive, no doubt,
but not fattening.

332
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:24,415
You've got to keep your strength up,
you're looking peaky.

333
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:27,415
Kidneys, liver, iron,
that's what you need.

334
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:33,540
Do you know a cow drinks its own weight
in water twice a week?

335
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:38,415
For milk, you see,
because a cow's got great big tits.

336
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,999
Just like you, eh, Georgie?

337
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:48,499
You gentlemen will have to take it
for granted because

338
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,124
for some reason best known to herself,

339
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,415
she's left her bra off.

340
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,665
Have you, Cory,
ever tasted human milk?

341
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:04,249
I mean recently.
All them years ago don't count.

342
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,040
You couldn't really appreciate
what you were enjoying then, could you?

343
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:15,040
I bet human milk's a great delicacy
in some countries. It ought to be here.

344
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:19,790
Do you know, Cory, who could supply us
with some human milk?

345
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:24,124
Warm, straight from the receptacle,
so to speak?

346
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:28,540
Don't joke! It's a precious commodity,
not a joking matter!

347
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:31,415
Georgie wouldn't joke about it, would you?

348
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:33,540
Would you, Georgie?

349
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:38,874
Ah. You're a credit to women. You could show
these young women a thing or two.

350
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,915
You could teach these young men
a thing or two. Take Mitchel.

351
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:46,665
On second thoughts, don't,
cos he's a crude little bugger.

352
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:50,540
- Then how come you haven't got any kids?
- Kids?

353
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:56,124
Who needs kids? Who wants kids?

354
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,290
I want kids.

355
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:05,249
We'll have kids one day, won't we, eh?

356
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,415
When you're bloody old and grey,
most like!

357
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:15,165
Yeah. Your trouble is
you don't eat properly.

358
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:20,290
You should drink more water
and eat more kidneys

359
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:24,415
and then you might bloody well have
a bloody baby someday.

360
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,915
Georgie doesn't like babies, do you?

361
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:33,915
You know, sometimes, Georgie,
I think you behave like a bloke.

362
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,374
What days are those, then, Albert?

363
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,499
- What's it like?
- You what?

364
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,040
Get away from this table,
you mucky little wimp!

365
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:48,165
Go and eat your vegetable soup in the kitchen,
you dirty little pervert!

366
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,415
Go on,
get on with your eating, eh?

367
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,749
It's only Mitchel
making a fool of himself.

368
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,040
Now, stand in the corner.
Cory, make him a paper hat.

369
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:01,290
Stand in the corner
like a naughty little boy.

370
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:04,749
Stand there.
Take your knife and fork with you.

371
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,624
- Don't be stupid.
- Do you want to join him?

372
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:14,290
Leave him alone. He's only copying you
like he always does. You behave, he'll behave.

373
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:17,624
- I'm leaving.
- Yes, we are leaving.

374
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:22,415
Gracie, here.
Pay the bill and take a taxi.

375
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:27,624
Yeah. Georgie and I
might go for a little drive.

376
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:32,624
It's our
wedding anniversary tomorrow.

377
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:35,624
Might drive down to the sea,

378
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:38,415
have some fun
under the pier like we used to.

379
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,915
Oops. I am sorry.

380
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,915
Still, this isn't a library,
it's a restaurant.

381
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:57,874
They got people for that.

382
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,540
Richard.

383
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:07,665
This needs cooking.
Grill it with some mashed peas.

That's woman's work,
ain't you got what it takes? Hey!

389
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:43,499
My God, armour plating.
You protect yourself, son, you need it.

390
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,749
Innocence.
That's what I had before I met Georgie.

Sing for me, yes.
Yes, you can sing for me.

00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:32,624
Yes. Women like choirboys.

404
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:36,165
I was almost a choirboy
when I met Georgie.

405
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:39,290
But you spoilt all that,
didn't you?

406
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:43,540
Georgie was a very good education,
she could teach a young man anything.

407
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:48,290
Come on, Georgie, show the young boy
what you showed me.

408
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,165
- Albert.
- Go on, show the little boy...

409
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:54,290
- Albert!
- You do what I tell you, will you?

410
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:59,124
You come out in that car park with me,
both of you. Come on.

411
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:02,040
Out in the car park. Come on.

412
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:11,124
I'll give you the best education,
show you what a great teacher Georgie can be.

413
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,665
Don't touch him!

414
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:17,749
- Leave him alone.
- I'll show you what a great teacher...

415
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:22,874
Oh, I see. So I'm not supposed to do that?
I'll give you an education.

416
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,790
- Albert, please leave him alone.
- Oh, no.

417
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,665
Stand there and don't you move.

418
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:30,790
- Just leave him be.
- Watch this.

419
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:35,290
- No. Wait till we get home, Albert.
- Georgie. Georgie, come here.

420
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:39,915
Right. What's all this?
You're not wearing any bloody knickers.

421
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:43,290
You've been sitting in that restaurant
with no knickers on?

422
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:47,790
With Cory and Mitchel and all those people?
What's this mean?

423
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,290
Where are they?
Give them to me at once.

424
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:54,415
Go on. Look at this.
Get in that car, you dirty whore.

425
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:58,540
Why don't you take everything off?

426
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:02,874

Do you know, Mitchel,
what prairie oysters are?

448
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,540
Fish.

449
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:39,040
So if someone feeds you a prairie oyster,
what would you be eating?

450
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:43,540
Fish. Like from the lakes and that.
They're the...

451
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,915
The clams with the little pearls in.

452
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,540
Prairie oysters would be very precious
to their owners. No.

453
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:52,915
No, look. Imagine...

454
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:57,165
Just imagine that
this is a prairie oyster.

455
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:01,165
Now, go on. Eat that. Go on.
Put it in your mouth. Go on. Go on.

456
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:03,999
Now, what's it taste like?

457
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,624
- Wet bread.
- No.

458
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,415
It's all squishy
with gritty bits in it.

459
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,499
That's the sand.

460
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,624
That's the sand.
You're a comic.

461
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:24,124
No, you mule.
It's got a skin round it.

462
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,749
- Do you spit the skin out?
- No.

463
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,040
Pick it out of your teeth afterwards,
chump it up.

464
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:36,290
Now, swallow that, go on,
swallow it. Swallow it.

465
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,415
Go on, that's right.

466
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:42,499
Now, Mitchel, you have just eaten
a sheep's bollock.

467
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,665
The next time I ask you
to work for me, Mitchel,

468
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:55,499
I'll be expecting you to chew
someone's bollocks off on demand.

469
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:59,540
Oh, you're back.

470
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:04,790
What do you find in that toilet that's so fascinating?
I'll go and have a pee and a look.

471
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:09,999
What have they got since I was last in there?
Velvet seats, dirty pictures? Hah.

472
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:13,749
Free perfume? A private drinks bar?

473
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,624
Cor, what a disgusting smell in here!

474
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:51,249
Must be the pigs using it, eh?
How disgusting it is.

475
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,749
Ha! Urgh, how horrible. Disgusting.

476
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,124
Revolting place, needs airing out.
What's this?

477
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,415
Gaw, phwoar, phwoar...

478
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:07,415
Look. "There was a young man from Uckinham
who got caught while he was..."

479
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:12,165
That is disgusting!
People ought to be locked up for that.

480
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:15,415
Absolutely appalling.
Not what I'm used to at all.

481
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:19,124
It's disgraceful.
Don't you reckon, don't you think?

482
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,415
Yes. God.

483
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,665
- 'Ere, what are you looking at?
- What are you talking about?

484
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:29,165
Don't pretend. You're waiting
for my young associates, aren't you?

485
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:32,540
A man ought to be able to piss
without harassment.

486
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,665
- How dare you? I'm getting the manager.
- I am the manager.

487
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:39,665
And you are out on the street.
Caught loitering in a toilet.

488
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:42,499
- Ow!
- Yeah.

489
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:47,540
That's what these people need.
Short, sharp, shock treatment.

490
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,540
Hello. What are you doing?
Reading again?

491
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:02,540
This is not a library. The only thing
you're allowed to read in here is the menu.

492
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:05,415
You are insulting the chef.

493
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:08,790
Reading gives you indigestion,
didn't you know that?

494
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:11,040
Don't read at the table.

495
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,415
I've just been reading stuff
to make your hair curl.

496
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:19,790
Out there, in the toilet.

497
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:23,040
That's the sort of stuff
people read, not this.

498
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:25,624
Don't you feel out of touch?

499
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,165
Does this stuff make money?

500
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:32,790
You know, I bet you're
the only man who's read this book.

501
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:36,540
But I bet you every man here
has read that stuff out there.

502
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:39,249
It makes you think, doesn't it?

503
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:43,665
You know, I reckon you read
because you got nobody to talk to.

504
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:48,124
I tell you what. So you shouldn't eat alone,
why don't you come and join us?

505
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,665
Come and meet my wife.

506
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:56,040
She's seen you. I know she's sorry for you
sitting here all alone.

507
00:51:56,375 --> 00:52:01,290
She likes to read too. She spends hours
sitting on the bed reading.

508
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:04,124
She even reads on the john.

509
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:13,624
This is Cory.

510
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:20,249
This is Mitchel.
He can't read, can you, Mitchel?

511
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,290
- Yes, I can.
- Yeah. Comics and dirty magazines.

512
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:27,999
And this is Georgina.
She is my wife.

513
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,790
What's your name?

514
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,540
- Michael.
- Well, Michael. Is that a Jewish name, Michael?

515
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:43,040
Do you eat kosher food, Michael? Sit down,
Michael, and tell us all about kosher food, Michael.

516
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,499
- I'm sorry but I'm not Jewish.
- Why hide it?

517
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,874
60% of the people in this restaurant
are a touch Jewish, Michael.

518
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:53,499
Richard, set another place for Michael.

519
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:58,499
He is Jewish, so maybe you could find him
some spare ribs. No pork.

520
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:05,165
He won't need those.
We're going to hold a conversation, aren't we?

521
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:09,165
You can start, Georgie.
Tell Michael all about yourself.

522
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:14,499
- I'm sure your wife would rather eat in peace.
- No. Talk, Georgina.

523
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,540
Here's your chance
to improve your table conversation.

524
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:20,790
Tell Michael you live in a big house

525
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:23,665
and you spend £400 a week on clothes.

526
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:25,790
I spend £400 a week on clothes.

527
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:29,249
You have a petrol allowance of £40 a week.

528
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:33,165
I have a petrol allowance of £40 a week,
which I never use.

529
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:36,040
- You wear beautiful things.
- I wear beautiful things.

530
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:39,499
- You eat in the best restaurants.
- I eat in the best restaurants.

531
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,165
Georgina, try a little harder, please.

532
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,999
- I go to a good hairdresser.
- Yes, the best there is.

533
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:52,415
- I go to a good dentist.
- Yes, yeah, oh, yeah. He's Jewish.

534
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:55,790
- I go to a good gynaecologist.
- You what?

535
00:53:55,791 --> 00:54:00,540
- Who says it's unlikely I'll ever have a baby.
- Michael doesn't want to know that.

536
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:04,415
That the three miscarriages
have ruined my insides.

537
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:08,040
That isn't true,
Michael doesn't need to know that.

538
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:11,999
Now, drink up, Michael,
let's talk about you. What do you do?

539
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,790
I'm a gynaecologist.

540
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:21,624
- You're a what?
- You could always come and see me.

541
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,040
We don't need to discuss that subject.

542
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:28,165
Being infertile makes me a safe bet
for a good screw.

543
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,249
Shut up, Georgie!

544
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:36,374
I must apologise for my wife, Michael.

545
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:42,165
If you don't get back to your table,
you're in danger of losing it.

546
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:44,290
The place gets very full about now.

547
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:48,665
Mitchel, take Michael back to his table.
Tell him about horses.

548
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,540
Oh, it's all right,
Mr. Spica, thank you.

549
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,999
I prefer to read my book.

550
00:54:55,916 --> 00:54:58,374
Besides, I've finished.
Thank you.

551
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:03,415
Thank you for
introducing me to your wife.

552
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:06,290
I like your name.

553
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,415
Ah.

554
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:03,790
What the hell
do you think you're doing? Eh?

555
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:09,999
Telling a complete stranger
intimate details about us?

556
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:13,040
It's not about us.
It's about me.

557
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:15,665
It's about us!

558
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:19,290
And what's all this, how much time
you spend in that loo?

559
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:22,499
What's all this about a gynaecologist?
Who is he?

560
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,624
It'd better be a she.
I don't want some bloke fingering my wife about.

561
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:31,249
It's a man. He's Jewish.

562
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:35,749
- And he's from Ethiopia.
- What?

563
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:39,790
His mother is a Roman Catholic,
he's been in prison in South Africa,

564
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:43,915
he's as black as the ace of spades
and probably drinks his own pee.

565
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:46,290
- Take that, you bitch!
- Oh!

566
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:49,915
You lying, ungrateful bitch!
You get in that car.

567
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,790
It's the doghouse for you,
you bitch.

568
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:57,540
Bloody gynaecologist.
Blasted gynaecologist.

569
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:02,624
Get up. Get up.

570
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:07,915
Get in the car, you slag.

571
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:11,499
Get in there. Go on.

572
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,624
Yeah.

573
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:44,665
Maiser came here.

574
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:49,290
And Trelawny with his black lady friends
who wore peaches in their hair.

575
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,915
- Peaches?
- Imitation.

576
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:56,374
And the Austrian brothers sat by the door -
high-wire professionals.

577
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:59,124
Great balancers, sloppy with money.

578
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:06,040
And Tim Tranter drank soup here
out of a cup with a straw when his jaw was broken.

579
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:11,415
There used to be a mark up there
where Goshy Capps threw a plate of kippers.

580
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,415
- Kippers?
- Yes, kippers, for God's sake.

581
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,915
You wouldn't find kippers here.

582
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:20,749
- They serve kippers for breakfast here.
- You've had breakfast here?

583
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:23,915
The ferryman and his lady
ate here every morning.

584
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:28,290
The ferryman was a poofter.
And fish disagreed with him.

585
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:32,790
- Who are all these people?
- Small-time crooks and pimps...

586
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:36,165
Boarst painted it out.
I'll get him to paint it back again.

587
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:40,290
...gigolos, busted boxers, cheap whores...

588
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:42,665
I've got the clippings at home.

589
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:45,915
...bullies, hairdressers, faggots.

590
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:48,540
- Robin Hoods.
- No, just hoods.

591
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:53,624
- You're getting very smart.
- Smart? Even his slang's out of date.

592
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:57,540
Now I'm the clientèle,
you understand? Me.

593
00:58:57,541 --> 00:59:01,624
And Georgie here and Cory Peterson.
The <u>coq au vin</u> is good.
(French braise of chicken)

594
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:05,540
- Cock a what?
- Chicken cooked in wine, you mule.

595
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:10,124
- Bess Riddle lived on coq au vin.
- More of the coq than the vin.

596
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:14,249
Starkie, there are ladies present.

597
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,999
- Or there were. Where's she gone?
- Gracie's no lady, are you?

598
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,665
- She must have a bladder infection.
- She's one of us.

599
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:25,540
There's nothing wrong
except she disappears to the john.

600
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:28,874
And which of the bladder infections
do you have, Starkie?

601
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:31,499
Ladies go to the toilet, not the john.

602
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,749
Real ladies don't go to the toilet,
they go to the bathroom.

603
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:40,540
- Boarst hasn't got a bathroom.
- Shut your mouth.

604
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:44,749
You'd pee in your pants before
you'd recognise a respectable WC.

605
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:56,374
So, he's broken the silence for us

606
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,040
and your name is Georgina.

607
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:06,999
Yes. And don't ever call me Georgie.

608
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:11,665
You have beautiful eyes, Georgina.

609
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:20,165
And you have a beautiful prick,
Mr. Gynaecologist.

610
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,749
- I have?
- Yes, whatever its racist beliefs.

611
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,040
- Your husband is a curiosity.
- He is?

612
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:40,790
Why?

613
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:42,874
Why what?

614
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:47,624
Why am I married to him?

615
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:52,540
Why aren't you married?

616
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:55,040
- How do you know I'm not?
- You're not.

617
01:00:57,916 --> 01:01:00,040
- I'm not.
- Why?

618
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,540
I once saw a film in which the main character
didn't speak for the first half an hour.

619
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:15,540
Like us? Do all the minutes we've been together
add up to half an hour?

620
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:23,915
I was completely absorbed as to what would
happen because anything was possible.

621
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:28,415
And then?

622
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:31,499
He spoilt it - he spoke.

623
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:36,915
- And?
- Within five minutes, I'd lost interest.

624
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:43,249
So now you've opened your mouth,
do you expect me to lose interest?

625
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:47,165
It was only a film.

626
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,165
Erm, now, we've been talking
for one minute.

627
01:01:56,541 --> 01:02:00,165
We've got four minutes left
before you lose interest.

628
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:02,540
Four minutes. That's enough.

629
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:05,040
Where's the bomb?

630
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:12,165
He's, er... He's eating
avocado vinaigrette and prawns.

631
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,790
With his fingers.

632
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:19,665
Kiss me.

633
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:29,290
- Your restaurant's noisy, Spica.
- It's popular on a Sunday night.

634
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:32,249
I like a quiet restaurant,
with floor shows.

635
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,165
Boarst is a culinary artist,
not a fancy entertainer.

636
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:39,915
But we're here to please you, Terry.
We'll get you a floor show.

637
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:43,915
Cory, phone Santini.
Five girls - strippers.

638
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:47,290
Make it decent, will you?
My daughter's present.

639
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:51,415
Five dancing girls with music.
Strictly no filth, only class.

640
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:54,624
And make it quiet.
I want to keep my ears till I'm 90.

641
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:58,999
God, Terry, what sort of floor show
do you like? Mute nuns?

642
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:03,290
If they call me Mr. Fitch, I might.
I'm only Terry to my wife, Spica.

643
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:06,915
- Like me.
- You're Terry and all, are you?

644
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:10,790
- I'm only Albert to Georgina.
- Even when she's in the loo?

645
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:14,415
- Shut your whore up, Cory!
- God, you're noisy, Spica.

646
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:18,415
Makes for indigestion.
Don't you find, love? What's your name?

647
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:19,915
Patricia, Mr. Fitch.

648
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:23,790
Are you a good dancer?
You look as if you might be a good dancer.

649
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:27,915
We'd like to see you
get up and dance, with Geoff.

650
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:30,499
Geoff's a very good dancer.

651
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,040
- There's no dancing allowed.
- I always eat at home.

652
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:36,874
- Best place.
- No food poisoning.

653
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:41,665
Ricky Boarst is as safe as houses.
He keeps a very clean kitchen, go and see.

654
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,249
I'd like to see.

655
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:49,499
- Mitchel, take the lady to see the kitchen.
- I'll take her myself, Spica.

656
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:56,040
- Show me the way.
- Through that door.

657
01:03:56,041 --> 01:04:00,040
I'll call in the bathroom
and send Georgie back tout de suite.

658
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:02,540
That means immediately.

659
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:06,999
- Your new girlfriend's cheap, Cory.
- She's only practicing her French.

660
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:09,540
It's a French restaurant, isn't it?

661
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:36,124
Someone's having pheasant for dinner.

662
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,790
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

663
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:49,874
We could be interrupted,
um... 700 times.

664
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:57,499
- What's your boyfriend paying you, Patricia?
- Paying me? He doesn't pay me.

665
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,790
He buys me meals and drinks.

666
01:05:00,791 --> 01:05:03,915
- Doesn't he give you no pocket money?
- No.

667
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:07,749
Nothing for a tuna fish sandwich
late at night or a bottle of gin

668
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:11,124
- to make you forget what you had for lunch?
- No.

669
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:14,374
Phew, it stinks here.

670
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:20,499
Listen, how about if...

671
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,540
if I gave you some pocket money?

672
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,915
What do I have to do to earn it?

673
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:50,165
OK, here they are. Where's Fitch?

674
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:53,790
Phillipe, clear those tables.
We need more space.

675
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:57,249
- But Mr. Spica, they are eating.
- Move them.

676
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,499
You are in the way of the floor show.
You're gonna have to move.

677
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,665
We're in the middle of our meal.

678
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:08,165
If you're going to eat quite quickly,
you can finish your soup.

679
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:12,665
After all, you don't want
to get trampled on, do you?

680
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,165
Hold him. Hold him.

681
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:22,374
It's a pity you didn't
take my advice.

682
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:25,915
All that lovely food.
Richard will be disappointed.

683
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:31,624
Now, you're gonna have to eat in the kitchen
like naughty little children, eh?

684
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:34,499
Hey, what is your name?

685
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,249
What did you say?
Did I hear you say William?

686
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:42,249
Well, naughty little Willie,
tiny little Willie,

687
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:45,499
how would you like
to be spanked on your big, fat bottom?

688
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:59,165
Seeing as you're so keen
on Richard's mushrooms, William,

689
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:04,124
you, I'm gonna give you five,
the count of five

690
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:08,374
and I want to see you
on the way to the kitchen

691
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:10,540
or you'll be out in the street!

692
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:12,499

Sorry, I had a surprise.

702
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,874
What bloody surprises

Why can't we meet somewhere else?

722
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:57,124
That's impossible.
It's better to do it under his nose.

723
01:09:57,125 --> 01:10:00,957
He'll never believe
I do it right under his nose

724
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:05,457
between courses,

725
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:08,499
between the <u>hors d'oeuvres</u> (appetizer)
and the <u>canard à l'orange</u>
(roast duck with caramelized sugar, a French classic),

726
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,457
between the dessert and the coffee.

727
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,207
Besides,

728
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,457
I'm learning fast

729
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,749
how to cut corners, save time.

730
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:26,374
I'm getting good at it,
aren't I, Michael? Aren't I?

731
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,124
Aren't I getting good at it?
Aren't I?

732
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,624
Aren't I getting good at it? Mm.

733
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,707
Aren't I getting good at it? Oh.

734
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:47,749
Last night was bloody awful
and you're to blame, Cory.

735
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:51,749
- Tonight you'll starve.
- I don't like the foreign muck anyway.

736
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:56,624
Don't talk to me like that, you uneducated prat!
You couldn't organise a rape in a brothel!

737
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:02,832
The girls were lousy, the music was lousy,
you mucked the whole thing up.

738
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,499
Couldn't keep your own girl
under control at all. Tch!

739
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,374
- First she shows off...
- I didn't.

740
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:11,999
Shut your face, who's talking to you?

741
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,374
Then she goes and plays hard to get.

742
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:18,707
I mean, if she's been with you, Cory,
how the hell can she be hard to get?

743
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:26,249
Spangler, get us a drink, quickly.
Then she upsets Fitch in some way.

744
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,499
- Fitch is a pig.
- Fitch has got manners.

745
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,749
He was like a bear with a sore head.
Did you piss in his pants?

746
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:36,582
Then she's giggling like a virgin
playing with a candle.

747
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:41,624
You'll have to make it up to him.
He likes you, though you look like a bloke.

748
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:45,749
- Perhaps he likes blokes.
- None of that homosexual talk.

749
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:49,124
He'll remember.
Yesterday evening's got my name on it.

750
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:53,332
I'm not going with him.
He sweats and stinks and he can't make it.

751
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:56,124
- Shut your whore up, Cory.
- Like Georgie?

752
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:59,582
- Shut up!
- She's a fine woman. She's never let me down.

753
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:02,207
- You must be joking.
- Shut up, Pat!

754
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:05,082
- She's upset.
- What do you mean, I must be joking?

755
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:08,082
- Here. Get rid of her.
- Don't do that to a woman.

756
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:11,374
- I do what I like to a woman.
- That's your trouble.

757
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:15,624
No wonder Georgie looks like she does
and hates your guts.

758
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:18,999
- What are you talking about?
- No wonder she screws around.

759
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,749
- You what?
- You're so bloody blind, you'd never notice.

760
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,707
- Shut up! She's raving.
- I'm not. I saw them.

761
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,832
- Who?
- Georgie and that Jew.

762
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:31,707
- What Jew?
- That bloke who sits over there, reading.

763
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:35,749
Haven't you noticed?
They always go off to the john together.

764
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:40,249
- You what?
- Why do you think Georgie's always in the john?

765
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:44,332
You blind bat.
She doesn't have the shits every five minutes.

766
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:47,332
Shit!

767
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:56,874
Shh. It's all right.
It's all right. Shh. Quiet.

768
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:59,124
Shh. Shh.

769
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,999
Shh.

770
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:28,124
I'm going to the loo.

771
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:43,499
Georgina!

772
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,749
Georgina, where are you,
you bitch? Georgina!

773
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:52,582
- What are you doing? Get out!
- Get out, you bitch. Georgina!

774
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:54,707
Where are you? Get out!

775
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:56,874
Go on, get out!

776
01:13:56,875 --> 01:13:59,207
Where are you?

777
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:03,124
- No, please!
- Get out of here! Get out, you...

778
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:07,082
Please, no! Please, no!

779
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:09,957
- Go on! Georgie!
- Please, no.

780
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,499
Where are you, Georgie?

781
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:31,249
It's over. He has found out.

782
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:35,082
Georgina? Georgina!

783
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:37,499
Georgina!

784
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,457
Georgie! You get out.

785
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:45,374
I'll get him to leave.

786
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:49,124
- Richard, don't get into trouble over me.
- Georgie!

787
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:55,124
- Let's go and face him.
- Don't be mad. He'll kill you!

788
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:57,332
Come quickly. Come with me.

789
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:06,624
- Wait here five minutes.
- We'll freeze to death.

790
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:11,124
He will never look in here.
Only five minutes. I will get your clothes.

791
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:14,332
Georgie, where are you?

792
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:20,749
Georgina! Georgie, where are you?

793
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,832
Georgie. Georgie.

794
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:27,124
You! Where is she? Where's my wife?

795
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:30,582
- What's the matter?
- You know. Fetching her cigarettes.

796
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:33,624
- Where's my wife?
- Your wife is your affair.

797
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:36,457
This is not a lost property office.

798
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:38,999
I want my wife! Where is she?

799
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,957
You! You stupid little rat.
Where's my wife? Where is she?

800
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:47,374
If you have finished,
I'll ask you to leave the kitchen.

801
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:51,582
- I have other diners to consider.
- Oh! Uh!

802
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:55,499
I'm the only diner who matters here.
I own this restaurant.

803
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,582
I want my wife.
You've hidden her. Where is she?

804
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:02,124
God keep me calm! Where are they?

805
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:05,124
Georgina! Georgina!

806
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:09,082
- Georgina! Georgina!
- Ahh!

807
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,999
Georgina! Where is she, Boarst?

808
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,499
Boarst, where is she?
Georgie! Georgie!

809
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:24,374
Georgie, you bitch!

810
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,124
Hard around.

811
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:35,332
Georgie! I want my wife!

812
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:46,582
Georgie!

813
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:54,707
I'll bloody find her.

814
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:59,707
I'll find them. I'll bloody find them.
I knew it. Scheming tart!

815
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,874
I'll bloody find them
and I'll bloody kill him!

816
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,999
And I'll bloody eat him!

817
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,624
I'll kill him and I'll eat him!

818
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:12,624
- I'll kill him and then I'll eat him.
- Oh, shit!

819
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:19,332
I'll eat him!

820
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:24,374
We can get you out.
Eden can drive you. Where do you want to go?

821
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,707
I know a place.

822
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:30,249
- What about our clothes?
- I'll get them to you. Quickly.

823
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,499
Quickly. Quick.

824
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:54,999
No. No. No, no.

825
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:58,207
No, please. Aah! No.

826
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,957
What is this place?

827
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:44,999
It's a book depository.

828
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,874
When my bookshop is quiet,
I do a stocktaking job.

829
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,499
I'm cataloguing French history.

830
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,124
There's a kitchen and a bathroom.

831
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:04,124
It's a bit primitive but
there's an extraordinary view.

832
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,832
Have you read all these books?

833
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:08,999
No.

834
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,582
It's not necessary
for the book-keeper to read all the stock.

835
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:17,957
With a job like this,
you could be very boring.

836
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,624
Are we safe here?

837
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:27,374
Does Albert read?

838
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:29,374
No.

839
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,999
If you don't read,
does that make you safe?

840
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,082
Only from bad books.

841
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:42,124
You could spend a lifetime
in here reading.

842
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:48,374
You could.
Two lifetimes - yours and mine.

843
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,207
- Is that what I'm in for?
- No.

844
01:20:56,458 --> 01:21:00,624
What good are all these books to you?
You can't eat them.

845
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:03,499
How can they make you happy?

846
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,499
I've always found them
very reasonable.

847
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,874
They don't change their minds
when you're not looking.

848
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:12,499
That sounds like
a disadvantage to me.

849
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,124
Kiss me.

01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:22,374

Do you agree,
until later, maybe?

857
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:47,707
How is the restaurant?

858
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:51,832
- It's all right.
- And Richard? Mr. Boarst?

859
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:54,249
He's fine.

860
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:58,832
ls there any more trouble,

861
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:02,124
er, like last night?

862
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,832
- No, sir.
- Would you like to join us?

863
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:12,207
No, thank you.
I'll eat later with Mr. Boarst.

864
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:28,749
Enjoy your meal.

865
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,749
Thank you.

866
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:40,957
Erm, have you any other news
to tell us?

867
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:47,499
Mr. Boarst says...
He told me to tell you to stay put

868
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:51,624
and he wishes you bon appétit.

869
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:53,582
Thank you.

870
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:04,374
When you're finished,
I'm to take the dishes back.

871
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:11,624
Oh, if you find any of those books interesting,
you can borrow them.

872
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,832
Wa-woo! Di-di-di-di-dah-da!

873
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:58,582
All right, where are they?
Where are they?

874
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,374
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

875
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:06,999
I don't suppose you ate all this yourself.
What have we got in here? Let's see. Ah.

876
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:11,374
Fish sauce with mayonnaise
and a touch of basil. I like basil.

877
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:14,249
What else we got in here? Aha.

878
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:17,707
It's sticky. Don't tell me.
Chocolate sauce - profiteroles.

879
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:20,874
Georgina liked profiteroles.

880
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:25,749
Oh, and serviettes
with Georgina's lipstick on them.

881
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,957
And a nice bottle of wine.
Very nice.

882
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:32,124
He's for the chop, Richard.
I'll get my hands on him.

883
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:36,457
Leave that bread roll alone. I need to know
where they are. Where are they? Eh?

884
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:41,874
Ah. Ah. That's good.
Open your mouth. Come on, open it.

885
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:45,999
- Take an interest in your food.
- We don't need to do this.

886
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,499
- Getting squeamish?
- He's just a kid.

887
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:53,624
- Stand him up and get his trousers down.
- Leave him alone.

888
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:58,874
Get out. Who needs fairies like you?
And take your four-eyed cousin with you.

889
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:04,457
See how you get on in the streets without
me to wipe your noses. Get lost! Righto.

890
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:07,999
OK, button eater,
tell me where they are.

891
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,374
OK, button eater, where are they?

892
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:20,124
We've run out of buttons.
But there is one more button.

893
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:23,624
It's your belly button.
How'd you like to swallow that?

894
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:25,957
- Albert!
- You still here?

895
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:28,707
Well, then, watch this.

896
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,374
Wake him up! Wake him up, wake him up.
I must find out where she is!

897
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:46,707
Wake him up!

898
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:52,499
Where are they?
If he comes to, he better start to talk.

899
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,749
I got 'em!

900
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:50,457
I have brought your dinner.

901
01:26:59,208 --> 01:27:01,707
Where's the kitchen lad?

902
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:05,332
- He is in hospital.
- What?

903
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:13,624
He said he told them nothing
and I believe him.

904
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:17,707
- I must see him.
- I don't think that's wise.

905
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:19,874
I'm coming.

906
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:23,499
You must take me to him.

907
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,749
- Start packing.
- What have we got to pack?

908
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:31,624
Richard. Richard,
bring that for Pup.

909
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:35,082
What can you do?
You only endanger yourself.

910
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,124
I'll only be gone an hour.

911
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:42,249
Richard, you can bring me back,
can't you?

912
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:47,874
Oh, poor Pup. Oh, poor Pup.

913
01:27:55,708 --> 01:27:58,124
Leave me something to eat.

914
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:00,124
Of course.

915
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:04,957

He hasn't got much hair to hold.

924
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:50,999
- Disgusting to be that old and to be her lover.
- Same age as you.

925
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:55,749
- I'm her husband, not her lover.
- You can only be one and not the other?

926
01:29:56,083 --> 01:30:02,374
If he'd been younger, I could've understood.
He'd just be a passing fancy. You bastard!

927
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:06,749
Right, Mitchel, now's your chance.
You are gonna chew bollocks.

928
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,499
- He's too old.
- What's that mean?

929
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:12,374
He's the same age as me - 40,
almost.

930
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:15,707
If he was younger
it would've been all right?

931
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:19,874
My God. When you're 17, is being 40 old?

932
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:26,499
- He probably hasn't had a bath recently.
- God, Mitchel, you are a prize mule.

933
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:30,499
Well, I mean, certainly...

934
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,207
- He must've been with Georgina last night.
- No! Shut up.

935
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:37,249
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

936
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,499
You pissing little worm.

937
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,874
God, you are an idiot, Mitchel.

938
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:48,249
You can be guaranteed
to say the wrong thing at the right time.

939
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:52,499
I didn't mean that you literally
had to chew his bollocks off.

940
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:55,749
I meant it metaphorically.

941
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,999
What does that mean, Albert?

942
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,249
"Jewish Book-keeper Savaged
By Young Sex Maniac."

943
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,957
I don't want this
to look like a sex murder.

944
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:10,249
It's a revenge killing, an affair of the heart,
a crime passionnel.

945
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:14,207
I want no evil gossip spread around about me.

946
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:19,624
They are not going to say... They are going
to say this was a dignified revenge killing.

947
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,207
They're gonna admire the style.

948
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:26,124
"He was stuffed. And Albert liked good food."

949
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:30,624
They might even smile.
"He was stuffed with the tools of his trade."

950
01:31:31,708 --> 01:31:36,582
"He was stuffed with books.
The crummy little book-keeper was..."

951
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:41,457
Mitchel, no unnecessary...
No unnecessaries.

952
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:47,874
Finish him off! Shut his mouth, hold his nose,
ram the bloody books down his throat.

953
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:50,624
Suffocate the bastard!

954
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,957
Michael!

955
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,457
Michael.

956
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:39,249
OK, so this is how you eat the crayfish.
First, you snap off the head.

957
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,999
Then you pull out the whiskers,

958
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,207
then you strip off the legs.

959
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:53,874
And then you poke out
the soft part of the body.

960
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:57,832
- You turn the light out?
- What light?

961
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:03,499
Idiot. You wouldn't remember to fart.
Place might burn down with all them books.

962
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:08,249
- That would nicely destroy the evidence.
- I don't want it destroyed, idiot!

963
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,999
I want Georgina to see it.

964
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:14,874
What did he say?

965
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:19,124
The French Revolution
was easier to swallow than Napoleon.

966
01:34:19,375 --> 01:34:22,999
Napoleon was a prat.
He threw everything away.

967
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:28,374
Napoleon liked seafood.
His favourite dish was oysters Florentine.

968
01:34:28,708 --> 01:34:32,124
It's amazing, isn't it?
Churchill liked seafood.

969
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:36,124
All the great generals
were keen on seafood.

970
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:39,249
What did Julius Caesar like,
or Hitler?

971
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:42,707
Hitler liked clams.
And Mussolini liked squid.

972
01:34:42,708 --> 01:34:45,624
- You're making it up.
- What do you know, Harris?

973
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:49,124
- What did the bookseller eat?
- You could tell from his vomit.

974
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:53,207
What do I care what he ate?
It all comes out as shit in the end.

975
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,707
I'm so tired.

976
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:20,874
I'm going to sleep.

977
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:38,749
I've got a lot to tell you
in the morning.

978
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:42,207
And I want you to listen.

979
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:47,749
Somebody should know.
And who can I tell but you?

980
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,582
And then...

981
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,249
when I wake up in the morning,

982
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:07,832
I want you to kiss me.

983
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:14,582
And then I want breakfast.

984
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:19,374
Erm, coffee and fresh rolls
and butter

985
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:24,124
and marmalade.

986
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:28,332
And toast.

987
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:31,707
And...

988
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,957
Good night, Michael.

989
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:43,624
I'll see you in the morning.

990
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:50,207
I love you.

991
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,457
- You shouldn't have done it. It wasn't worth it.
- You what?

992
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:59,624
Georgina wasn't worth it?
How bloody dare you say that?

993
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:04,749
Georgina's worth a thousand
snooty little Jewish book-keeping clerks

994
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:07,874
who masturbate over the French Revolution.

995
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:12,874
The book-keeper will get us into trouble
and he wasn't worth it. Calm down.

996
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:18,457
Little circumcised mediocrity
was screwing my wife! I will not calm down!

997
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:22,874
I've seen you, Harris, eyeing Georgina,
looking at another man's wife.

998
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:26,749
I've seen you watch her skirt fly up
when she got out of the car.

999
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,624
Yes, I've seen you sniffing her, Harris.

1000
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:32,999
And to think I ever trusted you with her,

1001
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:37,124
that I ever trusted you to drive her home
when I was drunk.

1002
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:40,374
- You get out of this restaurant!
- Calm down.

1003
01:37:40,375 --> 01:37:44,124
Mitchel, get Richard.
I want this man banned. Get out!

1004
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:47,582
- If you want to shout...
- I can shout in my own restaurant!

1005
01:37:47,833 --> 01:37:51,582
I own this restaurant.
Get out! Fuck you!

1006
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:57,499
Go, you mule! Richard, I'm closing you up.

1007
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:01,499
- Really?
- You are finished, Richard.

1008
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:06,957
Allowing decent people to dine
with wife snatchers. You're finished!

1009
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:09,499
I think not, Mr. Spica!

1010
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:14,749
And if I did, where would you eat?
Who would have you?

1011
01:38:15,083 --> 01:38:20,082
Now, if you'd kindly leave, we can start
clearing up the mess you have made.

1012
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:25,249
I'm warning you. Tomorrow
your restaurant will be just one big car park.

1013
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,207
- Nothing more.
- I wonder how you will do that.

1014
01:38:28,208 --> 01:38:33,124
A bulldozer, Richard.
Your cuisine will be 20 feet under brick dust.

1015
01:38:33,458 --> 01:38:36,957
Get out of it, Harris. You get out of it.

1016
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:40,749
Go on. I can tell loyalty when I see it.

1017
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:07,999
Well, Michael,

1018
01:39:10,375 --> 01:39:12,457
you didn't kiss me

1019
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,749
so...

1020
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:22,249
I suppose I have to
make my own breakfast.

1021
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:27,624
Don't get up yet.

1022
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:46,124
Well, Michael,

1023
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:51,249
that's that.

1024
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:56,124
Short and very sweet.

1025
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:03,624
Now you're not listening,
I suppose I could tell you about Albert.

1026
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:09,999
I meant to tell you eventually
but I'd have to know you better because...

1027
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,499
Well, because I'd be so ashamed.

1028
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:19,832
But it's important that I tell you now
so that I can have done with it.

1029
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:31,624
Albert beat me. Well, I know you know that.
You saw the bruises.

1030
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:35,374
He was regular in his habits.

1031
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,749
When we got back from the restaurant,
he'd make me get a hot, wet towel

1032
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:46,874
and accompany him to the toilet.

1033
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,332
And I'd have to wipe his...

1034
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:58,707
After I finished,
he... he made... Oh...

1035
01:41:03,333 --> 01:41:05,374
Help me, Michael.

1036
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:13,874
On his side of the bed he had
a suitcase with all kinds of objects in it.

1037
01:41:14,208 --> 01:41:16,332
Er, a toothbrush,

1038
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:20,374
a wooden spoon,

1039
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,124
a plastic train,

1040
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:29,707
a wine bottle.

1041
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:31,832
And he'd use them.

1042
01:41:33,625 --> 01:41:38,124
If I didn't do it whilst he watched,
he'd insist on doing it himself.

1043
01:41:40,083 --> 01:41:42,999
At least when I did it,
it hurt less.

1044
01:41:45,625 --> 01:41:50,457
I don't think he was very interested in sex -
not with me, not with women.

1045
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,999
I left him four times.

1046
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,207
I caught the night ferry.

1047
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:07,707
He and Harris found me in Brussels,
they brought me back.

1048
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:12,249
On the boat, Albert cried,
bought me presents.

1049
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:19,124
But then after we landed,
when we got just outside the harbour,

1050
01:42:19,458 --> 01:42:22,332
before the motorway, he stopped the car

1051
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:27,124
and he and Harris and Spangler dragged me out
and stripped me and beat me.

1052
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:35,624
'Michael,

1053
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,124
'all this must finish.

1054
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:45,249
'Help me, Michael. Please.'

1055
01:42:52,875 --> 01:42:54,957
He's dead.

1056
01:42:57,583 --> 01:43:02,582
They stuffed his mouth with paper
ripped from his favourite book.

1057
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:05,749
- Could you cook him?
- Cook who, Georgina?

1058
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:09,499
Michael.

1059
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,124
No. Mon dieu, non.

1060
01:43:15,083 --> 01:43:19,874
You have a reputation
for a wide range of experimental dishes.

1061
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,082
He might taste good.

1062
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:27,457
I'm sure he would taste good.

1063
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:29,999
What would taste best?

1064
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,332
His heart? His liver?

1065
01:43:33,333 --> 01:43:36,124
The cheeks of his backside?

1066
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:39,457
His prairie oysters?

1067
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:44,457
Georgina,

1068
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:46,457
sit down.

1069
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:49,832
Sit down.

1070
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:55,999
When you make out a menu,
how do you price each dish?

1071
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,249
I charge a lot for
anything black.

1072
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:06,249
Grapes, olives, blackcurrants.

1073
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:12,374
People like to
remind themselves of death,

1074
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:17,207
eating black food
is like consuming death,

1075
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:24,999
like saying, 
Death, I'm eating you."

1076
01:44:25,375 --> 01:44:29,457
Black truffles are
the most expensive. And caviar.

1077
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,874
Death and birth.

1078
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:37,999
The end and the beginning.

1079
01:44:39,375 --> 01:44:44,374
Don't you think it's appropriate
that the most expensive items are black?

1080
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:50,707
We also charge for vanity.

1081
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:54,749
Diet foods have
an additional surcharge

1082
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:58,624
of 30%.

1083
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:02,624
Aphrodisiacs, 50%.

1084
01:45:02,625 --> 01:45:07,582
And from what I saw,
your lover did not need an aphrodisiac.

1085
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:12,374
What did you see? I want to know.

1086
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:15,707
Nobody knew but you.

1087
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:20,332
Everyone pitied me.
Even you pitied me.

1088
01:45:20,333 --> 01:45:24,082
And how can I know that he loved me
if there were no witnesses?

1089
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:30,582
If you loved him, that does not seem
to be a very necessary question.

1090
01:45:30,875 --> 01:45:33,874
Yes, it does! Tell me what you know!

1091
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:40,124
What I saw was what you let me see.

1092
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:44,832
Of course it was.

1093
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:50,249
How could I know that it was real
unless someone else was watching?

1094
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:54,957
Tell me what you saw.

1095
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,249
Or are you ashamed to tell me?

1096
01:46:02,125 --> 01:46:04,499
No.

1097
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,749
I saw him kissing you

1098
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,999
on the mouth,

1099
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:15,332
on the neck,

1100
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:18,332
behind your ear.

1101
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:24,499
I saw him undressing you.

1102
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,374
I saw him kissing your breasts.

1103
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:39,124
I saw him put his hand
between your legs.

1104
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:43,999
And what did you see me do?

1105
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:49,874
I saw you kiss him on the mouth.

1106
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:58,499
I saw you lying under him
on the floor of the pantry.

1107
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:05,332
I saw him take you from behind.

1108
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:13,832
I saw you take
his penis in your mouth.

1109
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:19,499
I saw you...

1110
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:39,249
Do lovers always behave like that?

1111
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:47,499
My parents behaved like that.

1112
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,624
They did?

1113
01:47:49,625 --> 01:47:53,874
- You saw them?
- And lovers in the cinema behave like that.

1114
01:47:54,208 --> 01:47:56,374
No, that doesn't count.

1115
01:47:56,375 --> 01:48:01,124
And in my fantasies,
lovers always behave like that.

1116
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:04,332
Were you jealous?

1117
01:48:04,333 --> 01:48:06,457
Did we make you jealous?

1118
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:09,957
Did you want to join us?

1119
01:48:11,125 --> 01:48:14,832
- If you did, help me now.
- Georgina, no.

1120
01:48:14,833 --> 01:48:19,999
In memory of us making love in your kitchen
and in your fantasies, help me now.

1121
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,999
No.

1122
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,249
In memory of your parents making love,
help me now.

1123
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,207
Georgina, no!

1124
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:32,749
People I like learn my name too late.

1125
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:36,499
Too late?

1126
01:48:37,875 --> 01:48:40,124
Cook Michael for me.

1127
01:48:40,125 --> 01:48:42,124
No.

1128
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:45,832
This was his favourite restaurant.

1129
01:48:46,958 --> 01:48:48,999
It's also mine.

1130
01:48:50,083 --> 01:48:52,124
Cook Michael for me.

1131
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:56,707
If I did,

1132
01:48:56,708 --> 01:48:59,582
who would ever eat here again?

1133
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:06,124
How can I make you change your mind?

1134
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:13,374
Do you want to make love with me?
You can do what he did.

1135
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:19,457
How can I persuade you?

1136
01:49:20,375 --> 01:49:22,832
You can't. You may have loved him...

1137
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:25,249
You know I did, you saw me.

1138
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,874
But you don't have to eat him,
Georgina.

1139
01:49:30,125 --> 01:49:34,624
Do you... do you have
some idea that by eating him

1140
01:49:34,958 --> 01:49:37,499
he can become part of you?

1141
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:41,832
You can't believe that by eating him
you can always be together!

1142
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:45,082
I'm not eating him.

1143
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:51,124
- Albert is.
- Albert?

1144
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:58,499
There's £11,000.
It's Michael's.

1145
01:50:06,125 --> 01:50:08,249
Put your money away.

1146
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:17,249
Where is he?

1147
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:05,124
What's going on here?

1148
01:52:05,375 --> 01:52:09,624
Why do I suddenly have to come in
to my own restaurant like a stranger?

1149
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:11,707
Special invitations.

1150
01:52:12,875 --> 01:52:16,374
Which I might say
could've gone to a better printer.

1151
01:52:16,375 --> 01:52:18,957
I have to bang on the door
like an outcast.

1152
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:22,999
Well, well, well.

1153
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,874
Georgina Duckies.
What brings you here, you bitch?

1154
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,624
I'm very surprised
you show your face here, you slut.

1155
01:52:32,625 --> 01:52:36,374
Where you been?
Albert has been frantic.

1156
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:39,332
Shut up, Grace.
Find me a drink.

1157
01:52:39,333 --> 01:52:43,374
- Happy anniversary, Albert.
- I'll bloody kill you for what you did!

1158
01:52:43,625 --> 01:52:47,124
- You should find that easy.
- Don't think I'm taking you back.

1159
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:49,624
I'll make you pay, you slut.

1160
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:53,124
Your bottom's going to be
very, very sore for weeks.

1161
01:52:54,375 --> 01:52:58,499
No more books for you, girl.
You're staying in under lock and key.

1162
01:52:58,750 --> 01:53:03,249
There's going to be no more books
or prick-sniffing for you, girl.

1163
01:53:04,958 --> 01:53:07,457
Happy anniversary, Albert.

1164
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:11,124
What are you talking about?
It's not my birthday.

1165
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:17,707
No, but it's an anniversary that I shall
always celebrate, even if you won't. And you won't.

1166
01:53:18,083 --> 01:53:22,624
- What? Where is everybody?
- They'll be here presently.

1167
01:53:22,875 --> 01:53:25,707
- Look, Georgina.
- What?

1168
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:29,457
- It's all over now.
- What is?

1169
01:53:29,458 --> 01:53:32,874
- Grace, just go and look out of a window.
- Oh.

1170
01:53:32,875 --> 01:53:35,374
Mitchel, bugger off out of it.

1171
01:53:35,375 --> 01:53:38,582
Look, Georgina, when the others arrive...

1172
01:53:38,583 --> 01:53:41,499
Where are they? The invitation says nine o'clock.

1173
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:45,207
- Where are they gonna sit?
- They'll be here presently.

1174
01:53:45,458 --> 01:53:49,582
Look, Georgina, you didn't...
didn't really like him, did you?

1175
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:54,582
I mean, how could you like
a bloody book-keeper, a nobody?

1176
01:53:55,833 --> 01:54:00,374
I tell you what. I'll try...
We'll forget it, eh?

1177
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:04,124
Eh? Come home with me.

1178
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:08,624
Tell you the truth, Georgie,
I've been a bit miserable.

1179
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:12,582
- Since it is your anniversary...
- What bloody anniversary?

1180
01:54:12,875 --> 01:54:14,999
I've brought you a present.

1181
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,499
I don't need presents.
It's me who gives you presents.

1182
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:22,374
Besides, you've never had
the money to give me presents.

1183
01:54:22,625 --> 01:54:24,874
And Richard has cooked it for you.

1184
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,624
- Under my instructions.
- Oh?

1185
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:30,874
Knowing how you like to eat.

1186
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,624
Knowing how you like
to gorge yourself.

1187
01:54:35,875 --> 01:54:38,999
And we've brought a few
of your friends around.

1188
01:55:45,583 --> 01:55:48,249
What sort of party is this,
Georgie?

1189
01:55:50,083 --> 01:55:53,457
- What's going on?
- Sit down, Albert.

1190
01:55:54,708 --> 01:55:56,999
Can't I sit down, Georgina?

1191
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,332
No, this is Albert's special treat.

1192
01:56:01,583 --> 01:56:07,124
- Here, I'm not eating with that Roy there.
- Shut up, Albert.

1193
01:56:09,375 --> 01:56:11,749
You're here to enjoy yourself.

1194
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:24,832
Georgie.

1195
01:56:41,333 --> 01:56:43,624
Jesus!

1196
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:45,082
God.

1197
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:52,707
No, it's not God, Albert.
It's Michael.

1198
01:56:54,583 --> 01:56:56,499
My lover.

1199
01:56:57,625 --> 01:57:00,582
You vowed you would kill him,
and you did.

1200
01:57:02,708 --> 01:57:04,999
And you vowed you would eat him.

1201
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:08,999
Now eat him.

1202
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,249
What's the matter?

1203
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:17,124
You have your knife and fork.
You do know how to use them.

1204
01:57:17,125 --> 01:57:21,374
Or have all those carefully-learnt
table manners gone to waste?

1205
01:57:32,625 --> 01:57:35,207
Mitchel can pour you a drink.

1206
01:57:42,708 --> 01:57:45,499
Your waiter has opted out.

1207
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:48,582
Er, Grace will pour for you.

1208
01:57:48,583 --> 01:57:50,499
Oh.

1209
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:55,957
- Non, monsieur!
- Yah!

1210
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:16,999
Eat, Albert.

1211
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:20,749
Roy, pour Albert a drink.

1212
01:58:57,708 --> 01:59:02,124
Try the cock, Albert.
It's a delicacy.

1213
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:05,624
And you know where it's been.

1214
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,124
Go on, Albert.

1215
01:59:45,208 --> 01:59:47,124
Eat.

1216
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:07,124
Bon appétit.

1217
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:11,624
It's French.

1218
02:00:39,333 --> 02:00:40,832
Cannibal.
