1
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,135
5...

2
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:37,513
9, 10, 11...

3
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:39,472
12, 13, 19, 17...

4
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,476
- Arnie... - 15, 17.
- Arnie, eat some chicken.

5
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,104
I don't... I don't want any chicken, Gilbert.

6
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,148
You want some corn?

7
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:51,359
- I want... I want some corn.
- Have some corn.

8
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,947
Yeah, here.

9
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:01,661
- Good?
- Mm-mmm.

10
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:03,746
Not good corn.

11
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:10,003
- Gilbert?
- Hmm?

12
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,588
Are they gonna come soon?

13
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,883
'Cause I gotta go back home,
you know?

14
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:18,178
- Pretty soon.
- I want them to come.

15
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:22,682
- You wanna go home?
- No.

16
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:25,018
I wanna see 'em.

17
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,019
Okay.

18
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:30,105
They're gonna come soon, huh?

19
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:32,316
How many more miles
till they come, Gilbert?

20
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,610
- Three million, buddy.
- Three? - Yep.

21
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:36,654
Okay.

22
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:47,997
Gilbert! That's them, huh?
Gilbert, look, it's them!

23
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,502
Look! Look over there!

24
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,840
Over there!

25
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,722
Look at them, Gilbert!
They're coming!

26
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:10,896
Honk your horn!
Honk your horn!

27
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:14,481
- Arnie, get back here!
- Honk your horn!

28
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:16,902
- My brother Arnie's about to turn 18.
- Arnie!

29
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,320
- My family's planning a big party for him.
- Arnie, come on!

30
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,991
Watching the campers
is our yearly ritual.

31
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:28,037
They're doing the right thing
just passing through.

32
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,794
God, Arnie. You're gettin' so big.
Pretty soon...

33
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:37,713
- I ain't gonna be able to carry you no more. - No.

34
00:02:37,797 --> 00:02:40,632
- You know, you're getting littler, Gilbert.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,553
You're getting littler.
You're shrinking.

36
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:47,849
You're shrinking, Gilbert.
You're shrinking.

37
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:50,392
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

38
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,945
Endora.

39
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:04,739
Endora's where we are.

40
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:07,241
Describing Endora
is like dancing to no music.

41
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:12,414
It's a town where
nothing much ever happens...

42
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:14,916
and nothing much ever will.

43
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,837
Lamson's Grocery is where I work.

44
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,756
And miles out of town on the interstate,
there's Foodland...

45
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,510
where everyone else shops.

46
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,515
This is where I live with my family.
My dad built the house...

47
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,600
and it's my job
to keep up the repairs.

48
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,441
Doctors said we'd be lucky
if Arnie lived to be ten.

49
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:43,194
Well, ten came and went.
Now the doctors are saying...

50
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:46,113
"Any time now.
Arnie can go at any time."

51
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,626
Some days you want him to live...

52
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:03,671
some days you don't.

53
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:06,299
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.

54
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:13,848
I killed him, Gilbert. I killed him.

55
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,683
I know, buddy.
I know.

56
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:24,067
My older sister Amy's
more like a mother.

57
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:29,404
She used to manage the elementary
school cafeteria over in Motley...

58
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,489
until it burned down last year.

59
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:36,078
My other sister, Ellen,
just turned 15.

60
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:40,833
She got her braces off, and for days now
she's been walking around going, "Ooh. Ahh."

61
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,000
Like she can't believe
the feel of teeth.

62
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:53,845
I got another brother, Larry,
but he got away.

63
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,097
And then there's Mama,
who in her day...

64
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,599
was the prettiest girl
in these parts.

65
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,687
Ever since our dad was hung out
to dry 17 years ago...

66
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,563
Mama's had her hands full.

67
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:06,107
You see, with Mama there's
no nice way to break it to you.

68
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,278
She hasn't left the house
in over seven years.

69
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,617
- I'm Gilbert.

70
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:19,411
- Gilbert Grape.
- The garbage.

71
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:26,209
- "This is the stuff of the circus."
- Sunshine? Where's my sunshine?

72
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,254
I don't know, Mama.

73
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:31,048
- Just the essentials.
- Okay.

74
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,387
Gilbert, get him down from there.

75
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,183
- Arnie? - Hurry.
- Let's go.

76
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:46,229
- Amy, have you seen Arnie?
- No.

77
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:50,357
- I thought he was with you.
- No. No.

78
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,112
- I wonder where he is.
- Gee, I don't know.

79
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:56,740
Ellen, have you seen your brother?

80
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:59,034
- He's in the tree.
- Ellen!

81
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:02,454
He is not in the tree.
Gilbert already looked in the tree.

82
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:05,414
Isn't that right, Gilbert?

83
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,043
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:11,420
Whoa! Arnie.
Don't do that.

85
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,757
Don't do that. You scared me.
Come here.

86
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:19,053
- Wait, wait. I was up there, Gilbert!
- Yeah, you were up in the tree.

87
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:21,263
I was right up there.

88
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:14,898
Can I help you with anything?

89
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:17,735
- No.
- Thank you, and goodbye.

90
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:24,283
- Gilbert?
- Sir?

91
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:27,119
- Is something goin' on at Foodland?
- Well, I wouldn't know, sir.

92
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:30,330
I don't shop there.
I'd rather die.

93
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:33,458
I'll tell you, Foodland's
up to something if you ask me.

94
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,719
It's those lobsters, isn't it?

95
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:45,679
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.

96
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:47,973
Am I right?

97
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:50,641
You know,
you shouldn't worry about it.

98
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:54,312
It's just a phase.
People will come back here, believe me.

99
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:57,690
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:03,070
The way you say that makes me think
I'm talking to your father.

101
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:12,622
- Can I have these two, Gilbert?
- No, just one.

102
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,624
- Can I have these two?
- Sure, go ahead.

103
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:16,542
Say "Thank you."

104
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,835
- Say hello to Mama for me.
- All righty. See you tomorrow.

105
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,339
Gilbert? That was Mrs Carver
needing a delivery.

106
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:25,092
Could you?

107
00:08:28,094 --> 00:08:31,097
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Hello.

108
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:35,769
- Boys, go on outside.
- But we don't want to.

109
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:39,564
- Yeah, we don't want to.
- Go play.

110
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:40,900
Okay.

111
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,486
Hey! Hey!

112
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:48,405
Arnie, get back in the truck.
Keep countin', okay?

113
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:52,410
Okay. I was counting.

114
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:21,522
Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

115
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:34,201
Hey, kids, let's play!
Come on! Look!

116
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:38,163
We got the trampoline.
Come on, boys. It's fun!

117
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,794
The, uh...
The ice cream's gonna melt...

118
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:47,422
soon.

119
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:52,844
You're right.
It is melting.

120
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,715
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

121
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,842
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my!

122
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,968
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.

123
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,850
- Come on up here. I wanna show you.
- I don't wanna do it.

124
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,937
- You don't wanna do it?
- I want a pool.

125
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,105
- You want a pool?
- Yeah, we want a pool.

126
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,858
Come on. Come on up here.
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

127
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,827
Gilbert was just making a delivery.

128
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,954
Oh. Oh.

129
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:09,252
Gilbert, come here for a second.

130
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:20,011
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no, no. Really, uh...

131
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:23,683
Oh, no. No, no, here.
I insist. You deserve it.

132
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,895
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

133
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,897
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Bye.

134
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,524
Gilbert?

135
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,737
Come by my office.
We need to talk.

136
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,033
Okay.

137
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,577
Arnie?

138
00:11:56,881 --> 00:12:00,718
<i>Okay, son, it's a little dangerous
up there. Come on down.</i>

139
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:03,804
<i>- Arnie, get down! -Come on, son.
We've had enough fun for one day.</i>

140
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:07,099
<i>- Come on down.</i>
- Hey!

141
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:10,935
Hey! Hey!

142
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,271
Wanna go up there!

143
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:16,234
- Son?
- Yeah?

144
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:19,236
- Come on down.
- No!

145
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,489
I'm not coming down!
I'm goin' up there!

146
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:25,450
<i>Son, come on down.</i>

147
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,535
I'm gonna go up there!

148
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:32,917
- Arnie? Arnie. Come on down, buddy.
- Look up here.

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,834
Hi!

150
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:38,796
<i>Okay, son. Come on down.</i>

151
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:42,300
I'm gonna go up here!

152
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:47,096
- Come on, son.
- I'm goin' higher than before!

153
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,475
<i>- I'm goin' high! - It's gonna be getting
dark soon. Come on down.</i>

154
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:54,853
- Hey. - Hey, Bob. Yeah, look it.
Here we go again.

155
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:57,981
Basically, I don't like
to work on carburettors...

156
00:12:58,065 --> 00:13:00,109
and I can tell without gettin' into it...

157
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:03,362
that that is a complicated unit.

158
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:07,616
Now, I understand. I can do it
myself, but I need the part.

159
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,536
Look, let me show you.

160
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:11,954
See, it's this little guy right here.

161
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:14,249
See, the needle valve is worn down.

162
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:18,626
- And I need a new one. Can we order it?
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

163
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,463
- I can order it.
- About how long d'you think that would take?

164
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:26,552
- Probably a week. - A week?
<i>Don't make us come get you.</i>

165
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:29,637
You don't have to come get me!
I'm goin' up here!

166
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:33,933
<i>Arnie?</i>

167
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:38,771
Whoa! I'm not gonna fall!
Whoops!

168
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,899
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

169
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,902
Hey!

170
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,029
My shoe done fell off.

171
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,785
My shoe done fell off, Gilbert.

172
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,956
<i>I know a boy whose name is Arnie</i>

173
00:13:57,081 --> 00:14:01,126
<i>He's about to turn 18 and have a big party</i>

174
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:03,837
<i>I know a boy whose name is Arnie</i>

175
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,343
<i>Come on down, buddy. Come on.</i>

176
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:18,936
<i>Match in the gas tank. Boom, boom</i>

177
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,483
<i>Match in the gas tank. Boom, boom</i>

178
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:30,613
<i>Match in the gas tank. Boom, boom</i>

179
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:33,658
<i>Match in the gas tank. Boom, boom</i>

180
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:35,952
<i>Boom, boom, boom, boom</i>

181
00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:39,456
<i>Match in the gas tank. Boom, boom</i>

182
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:43,334
- Good boy. - Easy does it, now.
- Come on down, buddy.

183
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,171
- All right!
- Come on down.

184
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:48,464
Come on!

185
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,893
Here we go. All right.
Thanks a lot, Jerry. Really sorry.

186
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:03,771
Good.
Good boy. Good boy.

187
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:06,607
I'm gonna take him home.
I promise it won't happen again.

188
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,986
Son, we hear this every time. Then after a
couple of days, he's right back up there again.

189
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,073
Yeah, but this is the last time.
Right, buddy?

190
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:18,493
- It's the last time.
- Yeah.

191
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,163
- Come on. Let's go.
- I wanna go back up there again.

192
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:23,248
Let's go.

193
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,212
- I wanna go up there again.
- Arnie, man, good job.

194
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,714
- Don't touch him.
- Whoa! Nice try!

195
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,801
- Way to go, Arnie. Could you do it again for me?
- Get out of here.

196
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,720
- Hey, could you help me out later...
- Yeah.

197
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,600
- With the what?
- Something wrong with the fridge.

198
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:44,185
- The electricity?
- I don't know. Maybe.

199
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,478
- All right. I have to get my tools.
- Hi.

200
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,482
I'll see you... I'll just come by later.
Hi. You be careful, all right, Arnie?

201
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,568
Okay.

202
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,783
Don't disappear like that
again on me, okay?

203
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:03,287
Okay. I disappeared.

204
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,122
I disappeared on Mom like that.

205
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,835
- Please don't disappear.
- Just let him go.

206
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,670
- Gilbert, will you bring the milk?
- I promise, Mama.

207
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:14,298
- Good boy. - Disappear like that.
- Good boy.

208
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:17,550
The food.

209
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,389
- Are we ready to talk about the party?
- Sure. - I'm ready.

210
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:28,019
Ellen's in charge of decorations.
Get this... purple, orange and green.

211
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:29,812
- Sounds good.
- Theme colours, okay?

212
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:33,690
- That sounds pretty good.
- I'm doing the food, the cake.

213
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:35,444
Okay.

214
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,613
Arnie, I'm making something
very special for you.

215
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,907
- And Mama, you can supervise everything.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,867
- Okay with everybody?
- That's disgusting. - Sounds good.

217
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,704
What about me?

218
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:48,956
You are the guest of honour.
How about that?

219
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,959
Gilbert, what about me?
My party! It's my party!

220
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,960
You just show up, buddy.
That's your job.

221
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:57,048
- All you have to do is show up.
- You don't have to do anything.

222
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:59,466
All you have to do is turn 18.

223
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:02,303
- You know, that just leaves Gilbert.
- Huh?

224
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:04,971
You're the only one
without anything to do.

225
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:07,058
- Got any ideas?
- Sure he does.

226
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:09,851
- No, I don't. No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

227
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:13,605
- I'm almost 16, and I've got
pages of ideas. - Ellen...

228
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,857
She designed a whole cake,
and you haven't done anything.

229
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:19,194
- Stop it, Ellen. Can it. - Can I be excused?
- He never does anything!

230
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:22,531
- No! - Please, can't we just do
something as a family?

231
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:24,949
- This is no fair, Mom! I...
- Can I please be excused?

232
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:29,120
- It's my party though!
- Is that too much to ask?

233
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:34,000
So it's gonna be an exact copy of the
one... the original they built in Boone.

234
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:36,544
- Really?
- Which is no big deal, Gilbert...

235
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:40,673
'cause they're all...
all Burger Barns are built identical.

236
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:42,759
They're prefabricated.
They just ship 'em out.

237
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:45,094
I mean, it's so efficient.
It's amazing.

238
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:47,263
In a matter of a couple days...

239
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,431
there can be
a whole new restaurant there.

240
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,227
So I was driving past
the building site today.

241
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:57,273
- You know, it's goin' up right next to right
down the road from Foodland. - Right.

242
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,942
The general manager was there.
So I says...

243
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,610
"Can I fill out an application?"
He said, "You bet you can."

244
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:05,738
So I did, you know,
and it looks really good. I mean...

245
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:09,577
I might be wearin' one of them
uniforms, flippin' some burgers...

246
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,829
saltin' some fries.

247
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:15,999
You never know. It could be the
best thing that ever happened to me.

248
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:20,962
- Hey! Get...
- What's the matter?

249
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:23,298
Get out of here! God!

250
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,926
I saw her!
I saw her, I saw her!

251
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:29,761
- That wasn't nice.
- What? What did I do?

252
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:31,639
- You know what you did.
- Oh.

253
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:34,475
That's your mother in there.

254
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:36,644
- Your mother.
- I know.

255
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:41,399
I don't get you, man.
I just don't get it.

256
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,984
- Let's go, buddy.
- Okay.

257
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,446
Come on.

258
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,072
Run, now! Run!

259
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,454
- Hey! Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye, you guys.

260
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:58,373
- Move, honey.
- Gilbert, you're shrinking.

261
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:01,459
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

262
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,811
I'm not tired yet, Gilbert.

263
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:21,813
Well, you gotta go to sleep, okay?

264
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:24,440
Okay. Goodbye.

265
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:27,276
No, it's not goodbye.
It's good night.

266
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,446
- Yeah.
- Goodbye...

267
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,826
is for when you're going away,
and we're not going anywhere, are we?

268
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:35,785
I know that.

269
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:37,995
- Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
- See you tomorrow.

270
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,124
We're not going anywhere!

271
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,252
- Goodbye!
- Arnie.

272
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,097
- You gotta work later?
- Hi, boys. - Yeah, I do.

273
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,226
- Hi, Arnie. - Hi there, ladies.
- I gotta come back.

274
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,478
- How's Mama?
- She's fat.

275
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:07,566
- Come on, man. She's not all that big, Gilbert.
- What?

276
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:12,071
Listen, I saw a guy at the state fair
who was a little bit bigger.

277
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:14,114
A little bit bigger?

278
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:17,617
- Look, all I'm saying is she's not the biggest
I've ever seen. - Tucker, she's a whale.

279
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:19,702
- Well, take her out for walk once in a while.
- Tucker, she's a whale!

280
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,747
- Take her out for a jog.
- Get her out of the house.

281
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,750
- Hey, Bobby.
- Give her a chance.

282
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:28,128
- That's all I'm sayin'.
- Hi, guys.

283
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:31,548
- How's business?
- Not good. Hey!

284
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,674
Nobody's dying.

285
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:37,511
There's a clear ladder.
There's a clear corporate ladder.

286
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:40,347
- I mean, this is not...
- That's good.

287
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,642
That's a good thing for you to do...
to have that happen.

288
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:45,019
- If you guys would give it a chance...
- I-I...

289
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:48,439
I just was saying that it wasn't something
that I should be doing for myself.

290
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:52,234
Look, they use canola oil, okay? You know
what canola oil is? You probably don't.

291
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,111
- No. - They probably don't even
sell it at Lamson's Grocery.

292
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:56,280
- No.
- It's cutting edge.

293
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:59,533
- It creates a crispier french fry and...
- Well, that's...

294
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:01,451
and a more unique product.

295
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:04,996
And Burger Barn... Forget Wendy's,
forget Burger King, forget McDonald's.

296
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,209
That's, like, old hat.
Burger Barn's cutting edge.

297
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,543
I mean, I-I could really
stand behind it. There's...

298
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:13,589
It's an innovative place. You know,
they created the salad bar...

299
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,549
which is now mimicked by every
single fast-food chain in America.

300
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,844
- Yeah.
- They came up with that.

301
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:23,849
15 different toppings for each salad,
and 2 different kinds of lettuce.

302
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:26,351
And it's, you know,
it's all that you care to eat.

303
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:28,602
- I mean...
- Yeah.

304
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:32,731
You either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager...

305
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:35,693
of you can go from clerk
to cashier captain...

306
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,320
to assistant manager.

307
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:41,365
And then from assistant manager,
you could go to, uh, manager...

308
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:44,576
and then regional manager and then...

309
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:56,004
Look at the little fellas.

310
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:58,173
You mean my hoppers.

311
00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:00,174
Let's try this.

312
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:02,261
For my friend.

313
00:22:05,097 --> 00:22:07,266
There you go, my boy.

314
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:10,059
What do you say, Arnie?

315
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:13,187
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

316
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:19,944
Gilbert.

317
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,615
This Thursday.

318
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:29,704
It's our anniversary.

319
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:32,874
Okay.

320
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:37,462
Hello.

321
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,654
Gilbert.

322
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:06,656
I'll need a delivery later.

323
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:17,500
Have a nice day.

324
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:22,213
Gilbert?

325
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:24,548
Gilbert?

326
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:27,052
He's behind the chips.

327
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,014
- Delivery, son.
- Excuse me?

328
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:35,434
Delivery. She's gonna be
needin' some help.

329
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:38,395
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:42,441
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.

331
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:44,484
I'll do it, Gilbert.
I'll do it.

332
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:52,201
- Here. Wait a sec.
- I got it!

333
00:23:54,537 --> 00:23:58,498
- I did it, huh? - Look there.
- I did it by myself.

334
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:02,127
Yeah. Look at that.

335
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:21,104
- I could go at any time.
- Shh. Arnie. No.

336
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:24,315
Any time.

337
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,859
Excuse me. Where to?

338
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,736
Oh, just keep going straight.

339
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,992
All right.

340
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:36,994
My mom... My mom wants me
to become... become 18.

341
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:40,456
And I'm having a big...
a big party, huh, Gilbert?

342
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,834
- Yep. - When is that party coming?
- Six days.

343
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:47,796
Six days and my party,
and I'm gonna become 18.

344
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:51,341
- I'm 18, and you're not invited.
- Arnie.

345
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:54,428
- Don't be rude.
- Oh, it's okay.

346
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:56,637
He's just being honest.
I don't mind.

347
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:09,108
- I-I got the groceries!
- All right. Be careful with them.

348
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:11,779
I got the groceries.
I got 'em, okay?

349
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:15,365
- Uh-oh, Gilbert.
- No, Arnie.

350
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,867
- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry.

351
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,994
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

352
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:22,663
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no, I'm really... I'm really sorry.

353
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:26,210
- This is...
- It's okay.

354
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:29,712
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

355
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:33,382
Are you sorry? No.

356
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:35,884
I'm not sorry. He's not sorry.
We're not sorry.

357
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,178
Don't be sorry.

358
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:40,556
I'm not sorry.

359
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:48,563
So I think if we're gonna have people come
that early, we should have some appetizers.

360
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,649
Ooh, yeah, that'd be good. You know
those little Vienna sausage things?

361
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:54,903
And you put 'em in grape jelly
and ketchup and make a sauce.

362
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,198
- Well, I was thinkin, - I want hot dogs, Mom.
- How about pretzels?

363
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,659
- You know, like those Hawaiian appetizers
that they make with... - No.

364
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:04,579
You get pineapple chunks
out of the can and you wrap them...

365
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,207
with little pieces of bacon
and you put a toothpick through 'em.

366
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:11,002
- How do you cook the bacon?
- In the oven on a pan.

367
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:14,172
But the bacon's not gonna be crisp if
you bake it in the oven on a sheet.

368
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:16,507
- Yes, it will.
- And nobody wants greasy...

369
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,301
- No, you-you soak 'em...
- floppy bacon.

370
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:22,805
- Mama, I want hot dogs!
- We're gonna have hot dogs, honey.

371
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:25,808
- I promise, we're gonna have hot dogs.
- What... I want hot dogs.

372
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:28,852
- The thing about... I mean...
every party that I've been to...

373
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,813
- Ellen?
- is that...

374
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:34,860
- Could you not talk with your mouth full?
- Excuse me?

375
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:37,611
You're making me sick.
I'm gonna throw up.

376
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:42,241
- Oh. Okay, Dad.
- Ellen.

377
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:44,451
- Sure thing, Dad.
- Will you two cut it out?

378
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,828
- Okay, Dad. Sure thing, Dad.
- That's nice.

379
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:50,124
- Stop it, you guys. - Don't start.
- Dad's dead, Ellen.

380
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,750
- Gilbert!
- I can't believe you said that!

381
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:55,796
- Shut up!
- Dad's dead!

382
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,630
- Arnie.
- Dad's dead!

383
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:00,759
- Arnie, shh. Arnie...
- Dad's dead!

384
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:04,762
- It's okay. Stop it now. - Oh, God.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

385
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:07,390
- Arnie, stop it! - Calm down, Mama.
Don't get upset.

386
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:10,184
- Make him stop.
- Arnie, shut up!

387
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,604
You're crazy, Arnie!

388
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,062
- Stop it.
- Arnie...

389
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:16,941
- Dad's dead!
- Arnie, listen to me!

390
00:27:17,025 --> 00:27:20,444
- Just calm down!
- Stop it!

391
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:23,156
- Stop it! Stop it!
- That's enough!

392
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:25,365
- Arnie, that's enough!
- Stop it!

393
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:28,453
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

394
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:31,288
- Arnie, be quiet.
- Right now!

395
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:33,707
I said, stop it right now!

396
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:36,668
Amy. Amy.

397
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:38,796
It should be two-by-tens
or two-by-twelves...

398
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:41,965
and the space between 'em here is...

399
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,885
They're... Right now, it's at two feet,
and this should be 16 inches.

400
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:47,304
I mean, that's just standard.
And this right here...

401
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:51,224
See this here? Flat flooring?
I mean, flat flooring's like...

402
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:54,727
Once the wood gets old, you're
just gonna fall right through it.

403
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:56,730
Yeah, I guess Daddy wasn't
much of a carpenter.

404
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,818
Hey, Gilbert, why did... why did he use
two-by-sixes instead of two-by...

405
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:04,279
- Tucker!
- What?

406
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:07,615
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Sorry.

407
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,545
She's coming.
Hey, she's coming.

408
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,774
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah.

409
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:45,277
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thanks a lot for coming.

410
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,280
- Yeah, I'll come by tomorrow
with the wood. - Great.

411
00:28:48,363 --> 00:28:50,991
Just... Let's keep it quiet.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

412
00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:53,034
- What?
- Burger Barn. I'm in.

413
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,704
- I got the call.
- Oh, oh. Good.

414
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:59,082
It's not too late, you know.
Good night.

415
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:06,255
I think she's asleep. <i>"Let's say that you
wanna slice down zucchini squash...</i>

416
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,550
<i>with the electric food dehydrator.
Look at this.</i>

417
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:12,928
<i>- Wonderful.
- Perfect slices each and every time.</i>

418
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:14,388
<i>- Is that nice?
- Marvellous.</i>

419
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:17,016
<i>Of course, if you know someone
that can't chew too well...</i>

420
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:18,894
<i>- Okay.
- Taking corn off the cob.</i>

421
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:21,312
<i>Look at this. We'll just turn
the dial down a little bit...</i>

422
00:29:26,983 --> 00:29:29,986
<i>... freezed corn, and sit there
for hours with a knife.</i>

423
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,907
<i>- Literally hours cutting your corn up.
- Unbelievable.</i>

424
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,992
<i>Of course, for un...</i>

425
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:41,164
- "Right now, you get the..."
- Gilbert, what are you doing?

426
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,583
- Give me that.
- Sorry, Mama.

427
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:45,669
Jeez.

428
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,508
- Mama?
- Mm-hmm?

429
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:53,593
I made up that bed for you.

430
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,098
What for?

431
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,226
Well, just in case
you wanted a change.

432
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,186
I'm happy right where I am.

433
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,648
- You sure?
- Yeah.

434
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:22,996
Here you go.

435
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:28,836
Here you go, Mama.

436
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,462
Thanks, kids.

437
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,548
- Good night, Mama.
- You're so helpful.

438
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:43,892
- Another ball! - I took her delivery,
we talked a little bit.

439
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:45,893
And that was it.
I dropped her off.

440
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,646
What's she doing here?

441
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,689
She... I don't know.
She's just sort of here.

442
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:51,899
- I think their car broke down
or something. - Another ball!

443
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,194
Come on. You... I can see it
in your face that you're...

444
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,614
Can we just not talk about this now?
Can we just change the subject?

445
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:01,951
- Do you understand?
- We want a pool.

446
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:08,917
- Okay. You're tellin' me later.
- I'll tell you everything later.

447
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:11,836
- Look at those guys out there.
- Gilbert.

448
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,339
They're laughing, they're all happy...

449
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,757
and waving to their friends.

450
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:21,429
But the next day... and this is
the thing that they don't know...

451
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:25,266
they could be lying on the slab.

452
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:27,726
It's kind of, uh, harsh.

453
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:31,396
But it's kind of fun too.

454
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,612
- Do you ever, um...
- What?

455
00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:44,200
Well, you know.

456
00:31:44,325 --> 00:31:47,287
- Thank you.
- Are you tempted to, like...

457
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,916
wanna fool around with the bodies?

458
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:54,251
- Oh, Tucker, come on. - No, I wanted
to ask. I've always wanted to ask.

459
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:56,087
- That's all right. - I'm sorry if
it makes you uncomfortable.

460
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:59,632
- People are very curious about that.
- Because, I mean if you don't wanna talk about it...

461
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:03,220
The worst thing that we do is we take
the bodies... the grotesque ones...

462
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:06,014
the really, really ugly ones...

463
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:09,642
and we make... make jokes about them,
you know, harmless jokes.

464
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:12,478
Very harmless jokes,
but we come up with some...

465
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:17,775
- Come on. - some very good... good
jokes about them, my father and me.

466
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:21,779
But-But, you know, they're dead.
And, uh...

467
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:24,572
- You know, nobody can see that.
Nobody hears anything. - Hi, boys.

468
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:27,243
- Hi, Mrs Carver.
- Hello, Mrs Carver. - Hi.

469
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:30,079
Those jokes don't hurt anybody.
Nobody knows we even make them.

470
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:32,998
Gilbert, I'm waiting for your call.

471
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:36,251
Mr Carver, I haven't seen
your mother in church lately.

472
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,419
- How's she doing?
- Fine. She's fine.

473
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:42,006
Thanks. Bye.

474
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,301
He wants...
He wants to kill you, right?

475
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:47,345
Do you prefer a bronze casket?

476
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:10,076
Hey! Gilbert!

477
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,995
Hey, can somebody give me
a hand down here?

478
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:15,623
- What? - Can somebody give me
a hand with the wood?

479
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,545
- Hey, Arnie.
- Huh?

480
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:25,550
- You wanna go help Tucker?
- Uh-uh.

481
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:28,218
Arnie, go help Tucker in the basement.

482
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:35,517
Arnie, why don't you
go into the basement?

483
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:38,437
- I don't wanna go down there, Gilbert.
- Please?

484
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,274
No way! No way! No way!
You!

485
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:46,278
- Go down there, Gilbert.
- Is there a problem?

486
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:49,197
Gilbert? Hey!

487
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:51,825
Dad's in there!

488
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:58,498
Dad's in there!

489
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:00,916
Arnie, shut up!
Arnie!

490
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:08,591
Shut up! Shut up!

491
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,431
Come on! Arnie.

492
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:23,106
Arnie!

493
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:25,065
It's not funny!

494
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,150
Get back here!

495
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:33,616
Don't worry.
Those are two-by-sixes.

496
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:37,577
You know, there's six of'em,
so, you know, those could hold anybody.

497
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,254
- I-I forgot.
- What?

498
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,801
I forgot that that was where your dad...

499
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,724
Yep.

500
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,852
I'm-I'm sorry.

501
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:05,938
No, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

502
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,115
- No, Arnie! No! No climbing!
- I wanna go up there!

503
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,576
Arnie! No, you're not!

504
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:21,454
Arnie! Not again!

505
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:24,080
- Arnie! - I wanna go up there!
- Get down. Get down.

506
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,167
Get down!

507
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:32,047
You're not going anywhere!
Not too much fun, is it?

508
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,299
I wanna go up there!

509
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:40,346
No! We're going home!

510
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,642
We're going home.
Come on.

511
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,727
- Stop!
- Ellen, no! Stop it!

512
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,980
- Stop it!
- I told you, don't touch him.

513
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,064
What am I supposed to do?
He was climbing again!

514
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:54,652
I don't care. Just get out of here.
Get out of here!

515
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,362
Let me see, buddy.
Come on. Let me see.

516
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,908
Let me see. Oh, great.
You made him bleed!

517
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,663
What does Gilbert say?

518
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,166
If anybody ever hits you...

519
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,293
or even just lays a finger on you,
what are you gonna do?

520
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:13,713
Arnie?

521
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,798
Hmm?

522
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:19,844
You're gonna tell me, and then I'm
gonna take care of it for you, right?

523
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,596
And why will I take care of it?

524
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,556
- Gilbert.
- Hmm?

525
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,184
- Because you're Gilbert.
- Because I'm Gilbert.

526
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:29,561
Because nobody hurts Arnie, Right?

527
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:34,733
Okay. You wanna pick out some candy?

528
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:43,199
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What do you want?

529
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:45,952
We've got to keep
a closer eye on him.

530
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:48,913
- What?
- We've gotta do better.

531
00:36:48,996 --> 00:36:50,999
Are you listening to me?

532
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:57,505
- Mine.
- And you.

533
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:59,506
- Huh?
- You have to stay here.

534
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:03,386
You stay right on this porch.
You don't go anywhere.

535
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:06,931
- Don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.

536
00:37:07,098 --> 00:37:11,811
We're not going anywhere, Gilbert.
We're not going anywhere, you know?

537
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:16,148
We're not going anywhere.
We're not going anywhere.

538
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:18,443
We're not going...
We're not going anywhere.

539
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:23,738
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere!

540
00:37:23,822 --> 00:37:25,781
Gilbert, we're not going anywhere.

541
00:37:25,865 --> 00:37:30,787
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere.

542
00:37:32,164 --> 00:37:33,915
Where are you going?

543
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:39,062
Hey!

544
00:38:39,145 --> 00:38:42,440
I'm waiting.
Waitin' for that call, Gilbert.

545
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:45,317
Hey!

546
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,489
Hi, Gilbert.

547
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:59,665
- Oh, look. Come here.
- What?

548
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:02,501
- It's a praying mantis.
- Oh.

549
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:06,505
You know how they mate? The male
will sneak up on the female...

550
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:08,632
and she'll bite off his head...

551
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:11,135
and the rest of his body
will keep on mating.

552
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,387
And then when they're done...

553
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,513
she'll eat him.

554
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:17,600
She'll eat the rest of him.

555
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:23,105
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?

556
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:28,318
- Help yourself.
- Oh, thank you. Wow.

557
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,367
Well, we missed the rally
in Des Moines.

558
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:40,538
If we get on the road by Friday, we'll be able to
make Colorado Springs in time to catch them.

559
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:43,917
Have you ever been to Colorado?

560
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:45,836
No, ma'am.

561
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,837
It must be wonderful.

562
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,881
It must be incredibly frustrating then...

563
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:52,508
to be stuck here in this place, in Endora.

564
00:39:52,592 --> 00:39:55,344
This place is as good a place as any.

565
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:57,722
Think so?

566
00:39:57,805 --> 00:40:00,016
She should know.

567
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:02,769
Becky's been just about
everywhere there is to go.

568
00:40:02,852 --> 00:40:04,770
Places I didn't even know existed.

569
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:08,064
I'm a worldly kind of girl.

570
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:15,113
Me, I spent most of my whole life
in the same spot.

571
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:16,782
Why doesn't matter.

572
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:20,409
Anyway, she encouraged me
to get out.

573
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:22,662
Now she can't stay put anywhere.

574
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:29,169
She's the smartest,
most beautiful girl in the world.

575
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,212
Isn't she?
Isn't she beautiful?

576
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,881
Isn't she beautiful?

577
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:40,388
I'm sorry. She has this thing
with beauty that...

578
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:42,891
Oh, yeah, I noticed that.

579
00:40:43,016 --> 00:40:47,312
I'm not into that... that whole
external beauty thing, you know.

580
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:50,731
- 'Cause it... it doesn't last.
- Right.

581
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:54,319
You're, you know... Eventually,
your face is gonna get wrinkly...

582
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:57,988
- you'll get grey hair... - Sure.
- your boobs might sag.

583
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,366
You know? So what?

584
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:03,452
It's what you do
that really matters.

585
00:41:03,536 --> 00:41:06,080
- Right?
- Yeah, sure.

586
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,207
So what do you wanna do?

587
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:12,836
Oh, uh, I don't know. I mean,
there's not so much to do here, really.

588
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:19,385
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing that people do here.

589
00:41:21,303 --> 00:41:23,596
Um...

590
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:25,765
Thank you.

591
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:27,851
It was nice meeting you.

592
00:41:30,061 --> 00:41:31,104
Be nice.

593
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:38,153
- Hello.
- Hi.

594
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:49,371
Can I have yours
and I'll give you mine instead?

595
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:53,000
No, we want the big one!

596
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,670
You know something?
The one on top of it is fine.

597
00:41:55,754 --> 00:42:00,132
- No, we want the big one!
- Yeah, I like it.

598
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:02,260
- Let's go.
- Come on! Get us the big one!

599
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:05,471
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- Here you go, guys.

600
00:42:05,554 --> 00:42:07,931
- We want the big one.
- Yeah, that's fine.

601
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:14,229
It's changing.
That's what's wild about the sunset.

602
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:19,026
It'll just change really,
really slowly in front of your eyes.

603
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:27,951
I love the sky.

604
00:42:28,035 --> 00:42:31,579
It's so limitless.

605
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:35,541
It is big.
It's very big.

606
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,501
Big doesn't even sum it up right.

607
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:40,004
That-That word "big" is so small.

608
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:42,966
You'd have to get
those really giant words...

609
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,468
to describe the sky.

610
00:42:47,594 --> 00:42:49,972
Oh. Um...

611
00:42:50,056 --> 00:42:52,224
What?

612
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:57,188
I have to go do this thing.
It's kind of a family thing.

613
00:42:57,313 --> 00:43:00,441
Do you want me to give you a ride
back into town, or do you wanna...

614
00:43:00,525 --> 00:43:03,360
No, actually,
I'm just gonna sit here.

615
00:43:07,822 --> 00:43:10,910
I could come back. I mean, I can...
I can come back and...

616
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:13,495
- Really?
- Yeah. Will you... You'll be here then?

617
00:43:13,662 --> 00:43:15,705
- Yeah. - All right.
- I'll just sit here.

618
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:17,582
All right, I'll be...
I'll be back in a little bit.

619
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:20,127
- Okay.
- Okay.

620
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:25,090
- Gilbert.
- Hey, buddy. Come on. We gotta go.

621
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:27,175
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

622
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:32,304
- Gilbert, where's the duck?
- I can't see the duck anywhere.

623
00:43:32,388 --> 00:43:35,684
- Find him. Look. Where'd he go?
- Where's the duck?

624
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:39,228
- It's hiding. Find the duck.
- Arnie, I don't have time for this.

625
00:43:39,311 --> 00:43:41,606
Lift up. Okay, good.

626
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,775
- Ducky.
- Good boy. You know what?

627
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:47,319
- You're such a big boy.
- Yeah.

628
00:43:47,403 --> 00:43:50,072
- You're such a big boy. - I'm a big boy.
- Hey, you know what?

629
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:52,783
I bet you could do this all by
yourself if you really wanted to.

630
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:56,662
- Could you do this by yourself?
- I'm a big boy.

631
00:43:56,746 --> 00:43:58,622
- Yeah, be a big boy.
- Big boy.

632
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:01,876
- Okay, take this. - Take this.
- Wash everything.

633
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,837
- Your towels are there... - Okay.
- and your robe is there.

634
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,087
- Okay.
- Okay?

635
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:09,674
- The big boy's gonna wash himself.
- Right. Okay.

636
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:11,885
- I gotta go. - Okay.
- Gotta go.

637
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:17,265
- You missed it.
- What did I miss?

638
00:44:17,348 --> 00:44:19,642
- The sunset.
- Really?

639
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:22,270
- It was beautiful.
- Oh.

640
00:44:22,353 --> 00:44:24,355
Oh, well.

641
00:44:27,816 --> 00:44:30,820
I'd like to see where you live.

642
00:44:30,945 --> 00:44:34,866
- No, you wouldn't.
- Let's go see where you live.

643
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:36,909
Come on.

644
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:45,794
My parents split up
when I was a kid.

645
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,798
I go back and forth between them...

646
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:52,800
'cause they're always moving.

647
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:56,053
But it's good. It's my life.

648
00:44:57,263 --> 00:44:59,849
Yeah

649
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:02,017
We don't really move.

650
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:04,103
I mean, we'd like to, but...

651
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:08,523
my mom is sort of
attached to the house.

652
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:12,403
Attached is, I guess,
not the right word.

653
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:14,862
She's pretty much wedged in.

654
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:19,575
- What do you mean?
- That's it. That's the house.

655
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,540
It's really amazing.

656
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:27,709
I mean, how small it looks
from here, considering the...

657
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,671
the girth of what's inside of it.

658
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:39,303
I don't know.

659
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:42,807
Did you ever see a beached
whale on television?

660
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,851
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

661
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:47,895
That's her. That's my mom.

662
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:55,986
What about your dad?

663
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:59,364
Some other day.
Some other day.

664
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:15,422
I had a nice time tonight.

665
00:46:17,214 --> 00:46:19,468
I know.

666
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:24,598
- Good night.
- Good night.

667
00:47:09,432 --> 00:47:12,602
Oh, no. Oh, no.

668
00:47:12,685 --> 00:47:15,772
Oh, Arnie. Come on.
I'm sorry, buddy. Come on.

669
00:47:18,775 --> 00:47:22,195
Here, here.
You're okay. You're okay.

670
00:47:22,278 --> 00:47:25,114
You're okay.
You're okay, buddy.

671
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,950
Come on. Get warm.

672
00:47:27,033 --> 00:47:30,495
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.

673
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:33,540
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:33,623 --> 00:47:36,166
Would somebody please explain?

675
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:40,839
- Gilbert's in charge of bathing.
- I could have "drownded."

676
00:47:40,922 --> 00:47:43,216
I could have "drownded."

677
00:47:43,341 --> 00:47:45,717
- No more baths.
- But you didn't, honey.

678
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:51,098
- You could've, but you didn't.
- No more baths, Mama.

679
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:54,519
It is too much to ask
to see this boy turn 18?

680
00:47:54,644 --> 00:47:57,646
- No.
- It's ready.

681
00:47:57,771 --> 00:48:00,232
Where's your head lately, Gilbert?

682
00:48:00,315 --> 00:48:04,236
Where is your head?
Gilbert?

683
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,781
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry isn't good enough.

684
00:48:07,948 --> 00:48:12,119
- You gotta do better.
- Gotta do better.

685
00:48:14,537 --> 00:48:17,039
Hey, boss, is that the right price?

686
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:20,376
That's right.

687
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,130
- It seems like it ought to be more.
- Maybe at Foodland.

688
00:48:24,255 --> 00:48:27,550
We've always had
a reasonable deal on pickles.

689
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:29,634
Here.

690
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:33,722
Gilbert, got a delivery
for you, son.

691
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:35,809
It sounds urgent.

692
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,863
Uh, get out.
Go outside and play, right now.

693
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:51,741
- But...
- Right now. Hurry up.

694
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:02,376
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

695
00:49:04,503 --> 00:49:07,129
Gilbert, could you dial that number
over there for me?

696
00:49:07,214 --> 00:49:10,758
- My hands are all...
- Oh, yeah, sure.

697
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:13,261
- How have you been?
- Good.

698
00:49:13,345 --> 00:49:16,264
I saw you last night.

699
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:18,975
Who's the girl?

700
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:22,520
- It's ringing.
- I got... Sorry. One sec.

701
00:49:24,355 --> 00:49:26,816
This is good. Taste.

702
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:28,776
That's good. It's, uh, ringing.

703
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:30,695
One second.

704
00:49:31,821 --> 00:49:34,990
Hello? Ken Carver here,
Carver Insurance.

705
00:49:35,074 --> 00:49:40,079
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

706
00:49:40,162 --> 00:49:42,998
- Mr Carver?
- "Who is this?"

707
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:47,420
- Uh, it's Gilbert.
- Gilbert!

708
00:49:47,503 --> 00:49:50,506
- "I'd given up on you, Gilbert."
- Did you?

709
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:53,383
- "Well, yeah. Can you blame me?"
- No, no.

710
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:57,430
I mean, how many times do I have
to ask, and still no visit?

711
00:49:57,513 --> 00:50:00,015
- Well, I'm here now.
- Happy anniversary.

712
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:02,350
<i>Well, we can't discuss this
over the phone. I think it's best...</i>

713
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:05,270
that we meet man to man,
don't you agree?

714
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:07,689
- Yes.
- "Today is your lucky day."

715
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:11,026
I've just had a cancellation.
What about right now? Are you free?

716
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:16,906
Is that a yes, Gilbert?

717
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,408
- Okay.
- "All right."

718
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:21,411
I'm gonna be waiting
here for you, Gilbert.

719
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:24,414
Bye.

720
00:50:24,497 --> 00:50:27,375
Do you want me to be killed?
Do you want him to kill me?

721
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,669
Just playing.
Don't-Don't you wanna play?

722
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:33,797
This is crazy.
I, uh... I've gotta go.

723
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:36,340
- You don't have to go.
- Yes, I do.

724
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:39,803
Hey!

725
00:50:39,887 --> 00:50:42,432
It's that new girl, isn't it?

726
00:50:42,557 --> 00:50:45,225
No, it's your husband. He wants me
to come to his office right now.

727
00:50:46,392 --> 00:50:49,396
If you walk out that door...

728
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,815
Don't you dare walk out that door.

729
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:19,718
You look nervous, Gilbert.

730
00:51:19,802 --> 00:51:21,844
I'd be nervous too if I were you.

731
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:26,265
If I were in your situation,
I'd be downright panicky.

732
00:51:27,974 --> 00:51:30,686
I reviewed your file.

733
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:32,939
You've got
no major medical insurance.

734
00:51:34,107 --> 00:51:36,818
No catastrophic, no life.

735
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:41,196
Gilbert...

736
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:44,990
what if something
were to happen to you?

737
00:51:45,074 --> 00:51:47,620
Something unforeseeable?

738
00:51:47,703 --> 00:51:50,288
Something sudden? Random?

739
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:55,334
An accident, maybe.
What about your family?

740
00:51:57,421 --> 00:51:59,673
Do you ever think about your family?

741
00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:04,094
Now, stop thinking about yourself.
Think about them.

742
00:52:05,428 --> 00:52:09,473
You don't wanna leave 'em
empty-handed.

743
00:52:09,557 --> 00:52:12,101
Ken Carver here.

744
00:52:12,184 --> 00:52:14,187
Look, can't this wait?
I'm in the middle...

745
00:52:15,604 --> 00:52:20,609
Oh. Betty, please, calm down.
Calm down.

746
00:52:20,693 --> 00:52:24,113
No, no. I-I...
No, go on.

747
00:52:24,196 --> 00:52:26,197
Go on, go on.

748
00:52:28,034 --> 00:52:30,494
No. No.

749
00:52:39,669 --> 00:52:41,630
No, no. Calm...

750
00:52:41,756 --> 00:52:43,716
I'll... I'm on my way.

751
00:52:49,221 --> 00:52:51,639
Troubles at home.
I'm sure you understand.

752
00:52:52,766 --> 00:52:55,311
Oh, damn.
Betty's got the car.

753
00:52:55,394 --> 00:52:58,396
Gilbert, would you give me a ride?

754
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:21,419
Oh, my God! Betty!

755
00:53:21,503 --> 00:53:23,671
What the hell's going on here?

756
00:53:23,754 --> 00:53:26,716
Todd? Doug?
Betty, what is going on here?

757
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,135
I don't believe this!

758
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:34,430
Oh, great!
Oh, God!

759
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:36,101
Boys, come on.
Let's...

760
00:53:36,184 --> 00:53:39,103
Let's go show your mom the cookies
that she's baked for us.

761
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:41,814
This is great.

762
00:53:44,315 --> 00:53:46,318
All right.
Everything's okay.

763
00:53:46,402 --> 00:53:49,238
These aren't burned.

764
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:52,783
Look, honey, they're fine.
They taste fine.

765
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:55,618
They're a little burnt on top,
but just fine.

766
00:53:55,701 --> 00:53:58,579
They're wonderful.

767
00:53:58,663 --> 00:54:01,540
Boys, here.
Have some of Mom's cookies.

768
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:03,419
They're really good. Here.

769
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:05,670
Come on, boys.
Make your mother happy.

770
00:54:05,753 --> 00:54:09,048
Make your mom happy.
Have some cookies. Please. Please.

771
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:11,925
- Hey.
- Go on!

772
00:54:12,008 --> 00:54:15,345
- What are you doing?
- I could've had any guy. Any guy!

773
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,474
- What do you think this is?
- Doug, come over here!

774
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:21,185
- I chose you.
- It is a pool, son!

775
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:24,355
- I chose you.
- I got you a real pool, for God's sake!

776
00:54:24,439 --> 00:54:26,732
Look! There's water in here!

777
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,360
Come here! Come here!
Get over here!

778
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:32,404
Come here!
Get inside the pool!

779
00:54:32,487 --> 00:54:35,408
Get inside the pool with your brother!
Come here!

780
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:37,993
- Why did you?
- Get inside the pool!

781
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:40,829
Yeah. Look.
Real water, boys.

782
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,460
- Because...

783
00:54:46,543 --> 00:54:49,212
I knew you'd always be there. Because...

784
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:53,841
Because I knew you'd never leave.

785
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:56,511
<i>What the hell else more do you want?</i>

786
00:54:56,595 --> 00:54:59,306
<i>What? For God's sake!</i>

787
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,144
<i>Son, get back in the pool.
Get back in the pool!</i>

788
00:55:06,854 --> 00:55:09,773
<i>We're all gonna enjoy it!
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?</i>

789
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:13,778
<i>I'm doin' the best I can here.
I can't do any better!</i>

790
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:17,114
<i>I can't give any more!
I've given enough already!</i>

791
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,629
<i>I guess maybe I'd better be getting off.</i>

792
00:55:31,754 --> 00:55:34,798
<i>Not yet.</i>

793
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:37,760
- "Arthur, in all my life..."
- Move, Amy.

794
00:55:37,885 --> 00:55:40,929
<i>I wondered, where is he?</i>

795
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:46,142
<i>Just this moment, just now.</i>

796
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:51,815
<i>What is he looking at?
What is he thinking?</i>

797
00:55:51,898 --> 00:55:54,359
I think it's time for Arnie
to take a bath.

798
00:55:54,442 --> 00:55:57,278
No!

799
00:55:57,362 --> 00:56:00,490
Don't you think it's time
for Arnie to take a bath, Gilbert?

800
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:02,825
Just let him stink.

801
00:56:02,908 --> 00:56:06,037
- I don't wanna take a bath!
- Please.

802
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:08,832
You know Mr Carver?

803
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,959
Well, he's dead.

804
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:16,714
He's dead.

805
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,019
Okay, kids, hurry up.
Let's go.

806
00:56:34,189 --> 00:56:36,817
- Hi.
- Hey.

807
00:56:39,277 --> 00:56:41,780
- What's going on?
- He drowned.

808
00:56:43,865 --> 00:56:46,118
- You're kidding?
- No. In that.

809
00:56:49,287 --> 00:56:52,957
- A kiddie pool. I don't get it.
- Wow.

810
00:56:53,082 --> 00:56:54,876
It's like one foot deep.
Weird, right?

811
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:58,254
- Oh, yeah.
- He-He "drownded."

812
00:56:58,337 --> 00:57:00,757
Come on.

813
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,593
All right?

814
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,223
He had the cardiac arrest.

815
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:13,936
His head bent forward,
his knees buckled...

816
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,438
and then he just fell...

817
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:19,776
face forward into the pool.

818
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:22,320
When she found him,
he was already dead.

819
00:57:22,403 --> 00:57:24,571
That's what we don't know.
That's what nobody knows.

820
00:57:24,738 --> 00:57:28,534
No, I know it. I would...
I saw the... I saw the body.

821
00:57:28,618 --> 00:57:31,411
- I saw the... I prepared it.
I know exactly what...

822
00:57:31,495 --> 00:57:33,622
I would have seen...
I would have seen what...

823
00:57:33,705 --> 00:57:36,291
if there was any kind of struggle
that had gone on.

824
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:39,169
- It was murder.
- No.

825
00:57:39,252 --> 00:57:41,296
What do you think?
What do you think?

826
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,467
I, uh, I don't know.
I, um... You know, it's-it's possible.

827
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,054
Bob, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of dollars.

828
00:57:49,179 --> 00:57:52,014
- If she saw... - She doesn't have to work...
- Even if she did wanna do it...

829
00:57:52,098 --> 00:57:54,893
- She doesn't have to work for the
rest of her life. - Even if she did...

830
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:56,978
If-If you saw somebody laying...

831
00:57:57,062 --> 00:58:00,107
with their head down
in the pool motionless...

832
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,275
or even if they were kind of
limply doing that...

833
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,903
- which he wasn't doing, but even if that...
- You don't know that!

834
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:09,783
Well, it-it was an extreme,
uh, "post-cardial" infarction.

835
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:12,910
- Extreme.
- So nothing's fishy?
- N-No.

836
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:15,955
Hey, Gilbert, look!
It's that girl!

837
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:18,331
- Gilbert, it's that girl!
- It's perfectly logical.

838
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:21,044
Even if it's...
Listen. Wait a minute, Tucker.

839
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:23,587
We're not talkin' about takin' a
gun and shootin' somebody.

840
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:28,675
- We're talkin' about pushin' along
something that's rolling that direction.

841
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,262
- Please, play with me over there.
- Okay. - Please?

842
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:33,555
Come on. Let's play over there.
Come on. Please play...

843
00:58:33,638 --> 00:58:35,181
- How are you doin'?
- Fine.

844
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,601
- Will you play over there? Will you play?
- Okay. Okay, we'll play.

845
00:58:37,685 --> 00:58:40,353
- Settle down. - We're gonna play!
- Okay, okay.

846
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:43,314
- Will you give us a ride?
- Yeah, yeah.

847
00:58:48,446 --> 00:58:50,989
So, that's it.

848
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:53,908
Yeah, I guess so.

849
00:58:56,243 --> 00:58:58,747
The magic part.

850
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:06,795
The magic part?

851
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,215
The magic part, Gilbert?

852
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:17,598
- Hey, could we go...
- Grandma, here it is.
- Yeah?

853
00:59:17,765 --> 00:59:21,226
- Oh, thanks.
- Can we go play now?

854
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:23,437
- What are we gonna play?
- Hi. - Hi.

855
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,148
Can we play hide-and-go-seek?
Hide-and-go-seek?

856
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:27,857
- You like that?
- Gilbert? - Mm-hmm?

857
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,027
- Would you give me some help?
- Yeah, go ahead.

858
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:39,912
- Hang on one second.
- Okay.

859
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,956
Try it.

860
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,301
- I don't know.
- Yeah, I don't know.

861
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:58,930
I don't...
It's a mystery.

862
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:01,933
- Gilbert, listen, thanks anyway.
- No problem.

863
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:05,853
Come play with me in the water.

864
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:09,356
You can't find me.
You can't find me anywhere.

865
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,901
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

866
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,153
No, I want you to come in with me.

867
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:16,030
No.

868
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:18,281
Say "Where's Arnie?"

869
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:19,908
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

870
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,285
Where's Arnie?

871
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:26,833
You can't find me.
Say it again. Hi!

872
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,293
Say it again,
and you gotta look for me around.

873
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:33,547
I wanted you
to swim with me, Arnie.

874
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,215
Don't even try it, 'cause he's...
he's had a scare with water...

875
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:38,593
and he won't...
he won't come in.

876
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,971
I'm not comin' in the water.

877
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:46,392
- You wanna come in the water?
- No.

878
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:48,478
Why not?

879
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,941
Are you scared
to come in the water?

880
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,776
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

881
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,363
- I'm sure.
- He's scared.

882
01:00:59,488 --> 01:01:02,240
Are you scared, Gilbert?

883
01:01:02,323 --> 01:01:05,745
All right, what do you want to see?
Do you want to see...

884
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,957
Do you want to see me get wet
a little, like this?

885
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:11,167
- Yeah.
- A little splash?

886
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,255
A little more.

887
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:20,509
Do you wanna see this?

888
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,847
You want this, right?
Huh? You happy?

889
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:35,608
Tell me what you want
as fast as it comes to you.

890
01:01:37,442 --> 01:01:39,152
- Okay?
- Okay.

891
01:01:39,235 --> 01:01:41,196
Okay, what do you want?

892
01:01:42,572 --> 01:01:44,865
- Faster!
- Okay.

893
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:46,951
I want a new thing.

894
01:01:48,745 --> 01:01:51,915
House. I want a new house
for the family.

895
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:57,503
I want a...
I want Mama...

896
01:01:57,628 --> 01:01:59,756
to take aerobics classes.

897
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:03,551
I want Ellen to grow up.

898
01:02:03,676 --> 01:02:07,013
I want a new brain for Arnie.

899
01:02:07,097 --> 01:02:09,681
I want...

900
01:02:09,848 --> 01:02:12,519
What do you want for you?

901
01:02:12,602 --> 01:02:15,646
Just for you.

902
01:02:15,729 --> 01:02:17,898
I want to be a good person.

903
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:24,529
I can't... I can't do this.
I can't...

904
01:02:24,612 --> 01:02:27,783
- Okay.
- Where's Arnie?

905
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:32,871
Arnie?

906
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:40,170
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen my brother?

907
01:02:40,254 --> 01:02:42,296
No.

908
01:02:57,228 --> 01:02:58,854
Shit.

909
01:03:11,951 --> 01:03:14,912
- Hey!
- Come on.

910
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:17,497
Hey! Over here!

911
01:03:19,206 --> 01:03:21,002
- Hang on, son.
- Come on, now.

912
01:03:21,127 --> 01:03:24,046
- I did it again!
- Get this unbuckled.

913
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:26,757
All right, here we go.
There you go.

914
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,925
It's all right, Jerry. I got him.
I got him. It's all right, Jerry.

915
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:31,428
We're takin' him in.

916
01:03:31,511 --> 01:03:33,471
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise this time.

917
01:03:33,554 --> 01:03:35,515
We've warned you,
we've warned your sister...

918
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,434
that the next time
was gonna be the last time.

919
01:03:37,517 --> 01:03:41,146
- Great. Great. - Flash the lights!
Play the siren, okay?

920
01:03:41,229 --> 01:03:43,272
- I don't believe this.
- Play the siren for me!

921
01:03:43,397 --> 01:03:45,358
Way to go, Gilbert.

922
01:03:47,778 --> 01:03:50,237
- Jerry, listen. You're gonna have to take it easy on him.
- We'll take care of him, Gilbert.

923
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:53,949
- You gotta... Really, you gotta keep an eye on him.
- All right. All right.

924
01:03:54,033 --> 01:03:56,243
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

925
01:03:56,327 --> 01:04:00,372
Do the siren. Do the siren, okay?
Do the siren, all right?

926
01:04:12,217 --> 01:04:14,135
I know, Sheriff.

927
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:19,975
I know that, Sheriff.

928
01:04:20,059 --> 01:04:21,719
Okay.

929
01:04:22,544 --> 01:04:23,188
Asshole!

930
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:27,065
They're probably just teaching him a lesson.
They're probably just proving a point.

931
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:30,152
Yeah. That's right.

932
01:04:33,363 --> 01:04:36,408
Get my coat.

933
01:04:36,533 --> 01:04:39,244
What?

934
01:04:39,327 --> 01:04:41,954
Get my coat.

935
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:45,500
Get it!

936
01:04:56,553 --> 01:04:58,804
Let's go.

937
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,986
Well, at least he's in a safe place.
At least someone's watching him.

938
01:05:14,069 --> 01:05:16,030
Ellen, shut up.

939
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:32,628
You guys wait here.
I'll be right back, okay?

940
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:35,173
Mama. Mama,
let Gilbert handle this.

941
01:05:43,389 --> 01:05:46,850
- Jerry, come on, please.
- Please, have a seat outside.

942
01:05:46,933 --> 01:05:49,853
- Please, you gotta let him out.
- You need to wait your turn, okay?

943
01:05:51,939 --> 01:05:54,359
- I don't think you guys understand.
It's gonna be... - Look.

944
01:05:54,442 --> 01:05:58,488
No one's going to do a thing
until you go and sit down outside...

945
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:00,364
Jerry!

946
01:06:02,657 --> 01:06:04,911
Jerry!

947
01:06:09,123 --> 01:06:11,083
Jerry!

948
01:06:18,382 --> 01:06:22,844
Jerry, I've come for my son.

949
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:27,390
<i>Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?</i>

950
01:06:27,515 --> 01:06:29,685
Bonnie, you'll need
to fill out some papers.

951
01:06:29,768 --> 01:06:31,978
No! No!

952
01:06:32,062 --> 01:06:34,605
- Police procedure requires...
- I want my boy, Jerry.

953
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:39,193
- But Bonnie, you have to calm...
- My son! Give me my son!

954
01:06:50,496 --> 01:06:52,707
Come on. You're goin' home.

955
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:58,546
Sunshine, you're free!
Oh, baby.

956
01:06:59,755 --> 01:07:02,717
- Don't disappear like that any more.
- Okay.

957
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,261
- Promise me.
- Mom!

958
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:09,013
You're free, baby. You're free.
Let's go home.

959
01:07:15,478 --> 01:07:17,982
Hi!

960
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:20,066
Look!

961
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:34,581
That's why she needs a cane.

962
01:08:00,522 --> 01:08:02,775
Look at her!

963
01:08:22,086 --> 01:08:26,465
Mama, they didn't
flash the lights for me either.

964
01:08:29,008 --> 01:08:31,260
Flash the lights.

965
01:08:37,017 --> 01:08:39,394
Hey!

966
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:41,813
Look at me!

967
01:08:41,938 --> 01:08:45,774
I'm hiding!
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"

968
01:08:45,857 --> 01:08:48,152
- Say like that.
- Arnie, get down.

969
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:54,491
Gilbert, come find me.

970
01:08:55,951 --> 01:08:57,911
Where's Arnie?

971
01:09:00,205 --> 01:09:02,417
Hey.

972
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,710
That's my mom in there.

973
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:07,129
My mama.

974
01:09:07,254 --> 01:09:10,132
Gilbert,
come play with me up here.

975
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,466
Come play with me.

976
01:09:28,526 --> 01:09:31,278
God, that was so brave,
what your mother did.

977
01:09:32,653 --> 01:09:35,365
You know that, right?

978
01:09:36,866 --> 01:09:39,285
I'd like to meet her.

979
01:09:39,368 --> 01:09:41,370
No, you wouldn't.

980
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:47,043
Hey, where do you go next?

981
01:10:24,871 --> 01:10:27,290
I would like to meet your mom.

982
01:10:35,255 --> 01:10:40,053
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

983
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:43,390
we commend to Almighty God
our brother, Kenneth Carver...

984
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:47,601
and we commit his body
to the ground.

985
01:10:47,685 --> 01:10:50,771
Earth to earth...

986
01:10:50,854 --> 01:10:54,400
ashes to ashes
and dust to dust.

987
01:10:55,943 --> 01:10:58,153
The Lord bless him
and keep him.

988
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,989
The Lord make his face
shine on him...

989
01:11:01,072 --> 01:11:03,116
and be gracious to him.

990
01:11:03,241 --> 01:11:06,161
The Lord look upon him
with favour...

991
01:11:06,245 --> 01:11:09,331
and give him peace.

992
01:11:09,456 --> 01:11:14,169
Lord Jesus, by your death
you took away the sting of death.

993
01:11:14,253 --> 01:11:17,256
Grant to us, your servants,
so to follow in faith...

994
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:19,883
- for you have led the way...
- Hey! Hey!

995
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:22,635
- that we may at length fall asleep
peacefully in you... - Look it here!

996
01:11:22,677 --> 01:11:24,513
- Look it here!
- great in your likeness...

997
01:11:24,596 --> 01:11:30,393
- Look where I'm pointing! - the God of peace who
brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.

998
01:11:30,476 --> 01:11:33,730
The great shepherd of the sheep, through
the blood of the everlasting covenant...

999
01:11:33,813 --> 01:11:38,109
- It's a Burger Barn, Gilbert! - make you perfect
in every good work to do his will...

1000
01:11:38,192 --> 01:11:42,320
- Gilbert, it's a Burger Barn! - working in you
that which is well pleasing in his sight...

1001
01:11:42,404 --> 01:11:45,867
- Burger Barn!
- through Jesus Christ, amen.

1002
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:55,417
- Hey.
- Boys, you can have anything you want.

1003
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,838
You could get candy if you want.
You can have candy if you want too.

1004
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:02,550
As for me, something with menthol, please.

1005
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:05,260
You like gum?
Do you like gum?

1006
01:12:05,344 --> 01:12:07,846
I like gum.
Here's a good kind.

1007
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:11,432
- Here, take this. You can have it. Take it.
- Hey.

1008
01:12:13,977 --> 01:12:17,731
- You want gum too?
- We're going to St Louis.

1009
01:12:17,814 --> 01:12:20,024
I can't stay in that house.

1010
01:12:22,819 --> 01:12:25,196
I really am sorry about your...

1011
01:12:27,908 --> 01:12:30,743
Here, Mommy will take care of it.
You run on outside.

1012
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:37,248
Everybody thinks I killed him.

1013
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:43,089
Do you?

1014
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,508
No.

1015
01:12:53,057 --> 01:12:55,685
I miss him...

1016
01:12:58,645 --> 01:13:00,439
and I don't.

1017
01:13:00,564 --> 01:13:03,441
I miss him, and I don't.

1018
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:22,043
So, Gilbert, what's to become of you?

1019
01:13:23,712 --> 01:13:26,548
Oh, I'll probably just...

1020
01:13:26,631 --> 01:13:29,800
You haven't thought about it.

1021
01:13:29,883 --> 01:13:33,805
Poor Gilbert... cooped up...

1022
01:13:33,888 --> 01:13:37,434
taking care of everybody else,
forgettin' all about you.

1023
01:13:37,517 --> 01:13:40,060
- Mommy?
- Mommy is coming in a minute, honey.

1024
01:13:40,144 --> 01:13:42,146
Okay.

1025
01:13:46,107 --> 01:13:48,069
Concerning my boys?

1026
01:13:48,194 --> 01:13:52,865
I was thinkin' that if my boys
turn out anything like you...

1027
01:13:56,284 --> 01:13:57,953
Hi.

1028
01:14:08,505 --> 01:14:11,007
I was thinkin' how that would be nice...

1029
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:13,426
for my boys to be like you.

1030
01:14:31,027 --> 01:14:32,695
He's all yours.

1031
01:14:44,122 --> 01:14:45,875
Are you gonna miss her?

1032
01:14:48,377 --> 01:14:50,337
Yeah.

1033
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,844
Good.

1034
01:15:57,444 --> 01:15:59,571
Damn it!

1035
01:16:24,637 --> 01:16:28,098
So, what do you think?

1036
01:16:30,434 --> 01:16:32,645
- Wow. - Right?
- Wow.

1037
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:35,690
Right? Here, try a milkshake.

1038
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:42,404
Real milk in there.

1039
01:16:42,529 --> 01:16:45,157
- You're kidding.
- Real milk.

1040
01:16:50,704 --> 01:16:54,457
Bob... Oh, Bob.

1041
01:16:54,582 --> 01:16:57,669
- Hey! Congratulations!
This looks great! - Thanks, Bob.

1042
01:16:57,795 --> 01:17:00,047
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks a million.
- What?

1043
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:02,675
What, are you tryin' to depress everybody?
You're gonna ruin everyone's appetite.

1044
01:17:02,841 --> 01:17:07,012
Hey, hey... Mike, right?
You wanna come to my party tomorrow?

1045
01:17:07,096 --> 01:17:09,639
I'm gonna be 18 years old.
Wanna come?

1046
01:17:09,764 --> 01:17:13,143
You can come too, if you want to.
I don't know you, but you can come.

1047
01:17:14,977 --> 01:17:18,564
<i>How nice to see so many of
you here on this great day.</i>

1048
01:17:18,648 --> 01:17:22,652
<i>This day marks the beginning
of a new era for Endora...</i>

1049
01:17:22,735 --> 01:17:27,365
<i>for the Burger Barn family and,
I hope, for all of you.</i>

1050
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:30,326
<i>We at Burger Barn are committed...</i>

1051
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:35,455
<i>to a very special relationship with
you, one that will last and last.</i>

1052
01:17:35,539 --> 01:17:38,960
<i>In a time when so many things
are falling apart...</i>

1053
01:17:39,043 --> 01:17:42,295
<i>Endora decides to give
Burger Barn a chance...</i>

1054
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:45,799
<i>a new breath of life.</i>

1055
01:17:45,882 --> 01:17:50,721
She fixed it. The camper's fixed...

1056
01:17:50,804 --> 01:17:53,557
and we're gonna be leaving tomorrow.

1057
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:19,331
Come on!

1058
01:18:35,973 --> 01:18:39,642
Hey, you can come to my party
tomorrow, okay? You can come.

1059
01:18:39,726 --> 01:18:41,729
Okay.

1060
01:18:47,777 --> 01:18:50,904
- Hey! - Hi, Arnie.
- So, I'm invited.

1061
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:56,493
Okay.

1062
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:06,670
- Do you not want me to go?
- No.

1063
01:19:06,753 --> 01:19:09,714
I mean, go if you want.

1064
01:19:13,343 --> 01:19:16,638
Oh, so this is...
is this how you want it?

1065
01:19:22,518 --> 01:19:24,978
I have to go.

1066
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:29,943
Take care, okay?

1067
01:19:38,408 --> 01:19:40,411
Goodbye, Arnie.

1068
01:19:42,746 --> 01:19:45,666
- Oh, no.
- Come on, let's get that bath.

1069
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:48,584
No. No!

1070
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:51,130
Hey, Arnie?

1071
01:19:51,213 --> 01:19:53,840
- Arnie?
- Guys!

1072
01:19:53,965 --> 01:19:55,759
Arnie.

1073
01:19:55,884 --> 01:19:58,636
You gotta take a bath, Arnie.

1074
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,931
Arnie.

1075
01:20:02,056 --> 01:20:03,975
Arnie, you gotta do it.
It's your birthday.

1076
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:08,980
- Arnie! - Oh, no!
- Damn it!

1077
01:20:09,063 --> 01:20:12,692
Arnie, no!

1078
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:15,861
Oh, God.

1079
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,989
I can't make another one.
I can't.

1080
01:20:21,701 --> 01:20:23,953
We have to have a cake, Gilbert.

1081
01:20:40,427 --> 01:20:43,597
<i>Attention, Foodland shoppers.
Remember, every day this week...</i>

1082
01:20:43,722 --> 01:20:45,724
<i>is a double coupon day.</i>

1083
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,902
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

1084
01:20:57,985 --> 01:21:01,280
Um, my sister called in
an order for Grape.

1085
01:21:01,364 --> 01:21:03,533
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all set.

1086
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:10,289
There you go.
That'll be 19.75.

1087
01:21:27,305 --> 01:21:29,557
- Go away, Arnie.
- Gilbert, what's in there?

1088
01:21:29,683 --> 01:21:32,770
- It's a surprise. Leave it alone.
- What's-What's in that box?

1089
01:21:32,853 --> 01:21:34,771
Don't touch it.
If you touch it, I'm gonna kill you.

1090
01:21:34,854 --> 01:21:36,774
I can't believe you.

1091
01:21:36,857 --> 01:21:41,027
Look, I'll enjoy the party
from in here. It'll be fine.

1092
01:21:41,111 --> 01:21:43,321
Now, you'll see.
Everything'll be just fine.

1093
01:21:43,405 --> 01:21:45,407
What am I
supposed to say to people?

1094
01:21:46,993 --> 01:21:50,745
I mean, it's Arnie's 18th birthday. Haven't you
been waiting to do this for a long time?

1095
01:21:50,871 --> 01:21:53,999
I mean, wasn't it you that wanted to
have this huge party in the first place?

1096
01:21:54,124 --> 01:21:56,584
I didn't want to.

1097
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,839
- Damn it!
- I can't believe you!

1098
01:22:00,922 --> 01:22:04,342
- Arnie! - Oh, man.
- Look, he's eating the cake!

1099
01:22:04,426 --> 01:22:06,636
- Shit! - Arnie!
- That's it. Forget it.

1100
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,762
- Forget it. - Nice job, Arnie.
- Arnie!

1101
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:10,806
Now what are we gonna do?

1102
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:14,769
Arnie! Arnie.

1103
01:22:14,853 --> 01:22:16,979
Come here. Come here! Come here!

1104
01:22:17,062 --> 01:22:21,442
Do you know what that fucking cost?
Do you know what I had to do?

1105
01:22:21,567 --> 01:22:24,111
Come on.
No, no, it's time for your bath.

1106
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:34,663
Get your clothes off.
Get 'em off!

1107
01:22:41,545 --> 01:22:44,798
- Get in that bath. - Gilbert, no!
- Get your fucking clothes off.

1108
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:46,883
Come on.

1109
01:22:48,468 --> 01:22:51,763
- Gilbert, no!
- Don't move. Don't move!

1110
01:22:51,846 --> 01:22:53,639
Gilbert, stop!

1111
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:24,461
Gilbert!

1112
01:23:24,586 --> 01:23:26,547
What did you do?

1113
01:23:44,605 --> 01:23:46,901
Mama!

1114
01:23:48,527 --> 01:23:50,529
Arnie?

1115
01:23:53,532 --> 01:23:55,116
Arnie!

1116
01:23:59,704 --> 01:24:01,706
What is goin' on?

1117
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:05,835
Don't worry, Mama.
Ellen, let's go.

1118
01:25:57,026 --> 01:26:00,113
- We should call his mother.
- No, no, no. It's okay. I know...

1119
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:02,447
I know where he lives.
I can take him.

1120
01:26:02,572 --> 01:26:04,575
It's really okay. Yeah.

1121
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:15,377
Arnie, you wanna go for a walk?

1122
01:26:18,296 --> 01:26:20,425
You wanna go play, Arnie?

1123
01:26:40,234 --> 01:26:42,236
Come on, Arnie.

1124
01:26:51,705 --> 01:26:54,623
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it.

1125
01:26:56,751 --> 01:27:00,171
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it. Come on.

1126
01:27:00,254 --> 01:27:03,341
- "Merrily, merrily." Sing that.
- Okay.

1127
01:27:03,466 --> 01:27:05,634
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1128
01:27:05,718 --> 01:27:08,763
<i>Gently down the stream</i>

1129
01:27:08,846 --> 01:27:12,184
Yea! Yea!
You did it!

1130
01:27:13,392 --> 01:27:16,561
Good job, Arnie!
You did it!

1131
01:27:23,193 --> 01:27:25,946
So I'll see you in a little bit, okay?

1132
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:28,240
- Bye!
- Bye, Arnie.

1133
01:27:28,324 --> 01:27:29,949
Take care.

1134
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:33,204
You know, I "drownded," huh?
I "drownded" over there.

1135
01:27:33,287 --> 01:27:35,955
No, you just got clean.

1136
01:27:37,748 --> 01:27:41,294
Arnie!

1137
01:27:41,378 --> 01:27:43,797
Hi! How are you?

1138
01:27:47,883 --> 01:27:49,803
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

1139
01:27:49,886 --> 01:27:52,180
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

1140
01:27:52,305 --> 01:27:55,475
- Bye! - Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1141
01:28:23,877 --> 01:28:27,006
I hit him.

1142
01:28:27,131 --> 01:28:29,257
I hit him so hard, I...

1143
01:28:32,468 --> 01:28:35,013
He's gonna be okay.

1144
01:28:37,224 --> 01:28:39,892
You don't hurt Arnie.
You just don't.

1145
01:28:49,819 --> 01:28:53,823
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1146
01:29:24,436 --> 01:29:26,437
I got nowhere to go.

1147
01:29:33,277 --> 01:29:35,906
I had to work extra hours
just to feed her.

1148
01:29:37,365 --> 01:29:40,242
So it's your fault?

1149
01:29:40,326 --> 01:29:44,246
You don't understand. She was
in shock for years. He disappeared.

1150
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:47,249
He didn't say goodbye.
He just...

1151
01:29:48,793 --> 01:29:52,505
One day, all of a sudden...

1152
01:29:55,007 --> 01:29:58,135
he was gone.

1153
01:29:58,219 --> 01:30:00,513
He was just hangin' there.

1154
01:30:02,473 --> 01:30:04,975
That's when it all started.

1155
01:30:06,727 --> 01:30:09,814
She used to be so pretty.

1156
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:14,651
She was so pretty and so fun.

1157
01:30:16,946 --> 01:30:19,656
So you think it's his fault?

1158
01:30:22,243 --> 01:30:24,995
No.

1159
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:29,124
Nobody knew what he felt.
He didn't give anything.

1160
01:30:29,207 --> 01:30:32,002
He was just sort of there.

1161
01:30:32,085 --> 01:30:35,505
You'd try to play with him,
you know, get him to play around...

1162
01:30:35,588 --> 01:30:38,717
or get him to laugh
or get him to smile or get him to...

1163
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,011
I don't know... get mad.

1164
01:30:42,929 --> 01:30:45,681
But nothin'.

1165
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,478
Just like, uh, he was already dead.

1166
01:30:54,774 --> 01:30:57,026
I used to know a guy like that.

1167
01:32:23,068 --> 01:32:26,697
- Hey.
- Hi.

1168
01:32:31,492 --> 01:32:34,246
It's Arnie's birthday.

1169
01:32:34,329 --> 01:32:36,288
I need to go home.

1170
01:33:01,938 --> 01:33:03,523
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1171
01:33:03,606 --> 01:33:05,609
Give my regards to your mother.

1172
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,197
- Hey, Amy, look who's here.
- Where you been?

1173
01:33:10,281 --> 01:33:12,741
- You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right.
- He's alive.

1174
01:33:32,927 --> 01:33:35,889
Amy?

1175
01:33:35,972 --> 01:33:37,974
Where's Arnie?

1176
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:45,064
Amy. Please, Amy.

1177
01:33:49,444 --> 01:33:51,445
Is he okay?

1178
01:33:54,114 --> 01:33:56,200
I think you better
ask him that yourself.

1179
01:34:02,039 --> 01:34:04,500
Where is he?

1180
01:34:11,547 --> 01:34:13,842
I wonder where he could be.

1181
01:34:22,725 --> 01:34:24,936
Amy?

1182
01:34:27,689 --> 01:34:30,776
Have you seen Arnie?

1183
01:34:30,858 --> 01:34:33,403
Um, no, I thought he was with you.

1184
01:34:33,528 --> 01:34:35,738
- No.
- No?

1185
01:34:35,822 --> 01:34:37,323
No.

1186
01:34:44,872 --> 01:34:46,833
Arnie?

1187
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:52,546
Arnie? Anybody seen Arnie?

1188
01:34:54,716 --> 01:34:56,718
Where's my brother?

1189
01:35:01,556 --> 01:35:03,557
Boo!

1190
01:35:06,476 --> 01:35:08,313
Boo.

1191
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,696
Come here.

1192
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:20,614
You scared me, buddy.

1193
01:35:22,409 --> 01:35:26,203
You scared Gilbert.
Don't scare Gilbert, okay?

1194
01:35:27,289 --> 01:35:30,207
- Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Okay.

1195
01:35:45,598 --> 01:35:48,351
Come here.

1196
01:35:48,434 --> 01:35:50,686
Who's got you?

1197
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:09,163
You better talk to Mama.

1198
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:15,251
Mama?

1199
01:36:23,842 --> 01:36:25,845
Mama?

1200
01:36:30,892 --> 01:36:33,019
What you did was...

1201
01:36:37,398 --> 01:36:39,316
He's a helpless boy, Gilbert.

1202
01:36:46,783 --> 01:36:49,410
And then disappearing like that?

1203
01:36:50,996 --> 01:36:53,914
I hate that.

1204
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:56,082
You know how I hate that.

1205
01:36:59,795 --> 01:37:02,423
You walked out,
and I thought...

1206
01:37:02,506 --> 01:37:04,675
I can't take another.

1207
01:37:08,095 --> 01:37:11,598
But you came back, Gilbert.

1208
01:37:11,681 --> 01:37:14,101
Why?

1209
01:37:14,184 --> 01:37:15,935
Why did you?

1210
01:37:24,069 --> 01:37:26,070
I don't know, Mama.

1211
01:37:27,613 --> 01:37:32,118
I'm here now.
I'm here now.

1212
01:37:35,246 --> 01:37:37,582
Yes, you are.

1213
01:37:38,709 --> 01:37:40,752
You came back for the party.

1214
01:37:45,715 --> 01:37:49,343
Oh, Gilbert.

1215
01:37:49,426 --> 01:37:53,347
I can't imagine
how it's been for you kids.

1216
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,935
I know what a burden I am.

1217
01:37:59,019 --> 01:38:01,021
Don't say that.

1218
01:38:02,314 --> 01:38:04,776
I know it.

1219
01:38:04,859 --> 01:38:07,694
And I know that
you're ashamed of me.

1220
01:38:09,071 --> 01:38:11,698
No, I'm not.

1221
01:38:11,782 --> 01:38:14,325
No, I'm not.

1222
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:25,586
I never, never meant
to be like this.

1223
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:31,050
I never wanted to be a joke.

1224
01:38:31,133 --> 01:38:34,387
- You're no joke, Mama.
- I never wanted to be.

1225
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,848
You're no joke.

1226
01:38:36,932 --> 01:38:39,809
- You're no joke.
- Oh, Gilbert.

1227
01:38:39,892 --> 01:38:43,896
Please don't disappear.
Please don't disappear.

1228
01:38:50,277 --> 01:38:55,282
- Hurry! Hurry! - You're really growing
up to be quite a young lady.

1229
01:38:55,407 --> 01:38:58,785
- Thanks. - Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

1230
01:38:58,868 --> 01:39:00,871
You know, I don't want to
rain on the day here...

1231
01:39:00,955 --> 01:39:02,957
but you have a serious
foundation problem.

1232
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,584
You see how this...
the porch is slanted right here?

1233
01:39:06,668 --> 01:39:10,297
I mean, this is a serious problem, Gilbert.
We need to get up underneath here...

1234
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:13,467
First of all, we need to fill this in
so that no more water collects here.

1235
01:39:13,551 --> 01:39:15,593
And then we'll probably...
What?

1236
01:39:22,474 --> 01:39:24,019
- Hi.
- Hi.

1237
01:39:24,102 --> 01:39:26,604
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Nana.

1238
01:39:28,898 --> 01:39:31,568
- You ready?
- For what?

1239
01:39:32,609 --> 01:39:35,529
I want you to...
I want you to come meet somebody.

1240
01:39:37,114 --> 01:39:38,990
Okay.

1241
01:39:39,073 --> 01:39:41,494
- Hey! - Hi, Arnie.
- Hi.

1242
01:39:41,578 --> 01:39:44,873
- Here's your present.
- Arnie, what do you say?

1243
01:39:44,956 --> 01:39:46,957
Thank you!

1244
01:39:53,797 --> 01:39:55,342
Mama?

1245
01:39:58,010 --> 01:40:01,055
Mama, I want you
to meet somebody.

1246
01:40:02,598 --> 01:40:05,391
- No!
- Please?

1247
01:40:07,811 --> 01:40:10,229
- Just this once, for me?
- Gilbert, it's okay.

1248
01:40:10,313 --> 01:40:13,441
- We can do it later.
- No. This is what I want.

1249
01:40:14,817 --> 01:40:17,153
Do it for me, please?

1250
01:40:17,236 --> 01:40:20,238
This is different.
Nobody's gonna laugh.

1251
01:40:20,322 --> 01:40:23,077
I'm not gonna hurt you
any more, Mama.

1252
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,703
I promise.

1253
01:40:26,703 --> 01:40:28,706
Please.

1254
01:40:32,126 --> 01:40:34,169
Okay.

1255
01:40:34,252 --> 01:40:37,715
Okay. Becky?

1256
01:40:46,473 --> 01:40:49,477
Mama, this is Becky.

1257
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,937
- Hello.
- Hi.

1258
01:40:59,027 --> 01:41:01,529
I haven't always been like this.

1259
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:06,535
I haven't always been like this.

1260
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:16,128
- I'm called a miracle.
- You're a miracle?

1261
01:41:16,211 --> 01:41:18,587
- I'm a miracle.
- A walking miracle. I can believe that.

1262
01:41:18,713 --> 01:41:21,133
I'm just gonna put this up here.

1263
01:41:21,216 --> 01:41:24,635
- Uh, bye.
- Goodbye, Arnie.

1264
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,512
- Bye.
- You take care.

1265
01:41:35,604 --> 01:41:37,857
I had a really nice time.

1266
01:41:40,317 --> 01:41:41,861
I know.

1267
01:41:51,287 --> 01:41:55,081
- I don't know what to say.
- Say, "Thank you," Gilbert.

1268
01:41:55,165 --> 01:41:57,335
Say, "Thank you."

1269
01:42:06,717 --> 01:42:08,678
Thank you.

1270
01:42:16,644 --> 01:42:20,564
- Goodbye.
- No, it's not goodbye, Arnie.

1271
01:42:20,648 --> 01:42:25,570
It's goodnight. Goodnight...
Goodnight to you, but not me.

1272
01:42:25,654 --> 01:42:27,821
Hey, they're coming!

1273
01:42:27,906 --> 01:42:30,950
Bye! Wait!

1274
01:42:51,595 --> 01:42:54,390
Mama?

1275
01:42:58,184 --> 01:43:00,062
Mama, what are you doing?

1276
01:43:07,194 --> 01:43:09,404
<i>To work in Danny's office.</i>

1277
01:43:11,739 --> 01:43:13,700
<i>I thought you'd be pleased.</i>

1278
01:43:13,825 --> 01:43:15,785
<i>Oh, I am pleased.</i>

1279
01:43:18,204 --> 01:43:20,624
<i>So close your eyes.</i>

1280
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:50,319
Amy? Amy?

1281
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,241
You rest, Mama.

1282
01:43:58,952 --> 01:44:00,954
You deserve to rest.

1283
01:44:03,165 --> 01:44:06,334
Amy, get me my birthday boy.

1284
01:44:06,417 --> 01:44:08,420
- I want my birthday boy.
- Okay.

1285
01:44:08,503 --> 01:44:12,048
Here, Mama.
Here's the water.

1286
01:44:12,131 --> 01:44:14,134
Gilbert.

1287
01:44:18,137 --> 01:44:20,556
You're my knight
in shimmering armour.

1288
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,683
Did you know that?

1289
01:44:23,768 --> 01:44:25,811
I think you mean shining.

1290
01:44:26,771 --> 01:44:30,191
No. Shimmering.

1291
01:44:30,358 --> 01:44:32,652
You shimmer and you glow.

1292
01:44:39,867 --> 01:44:44,621
You rest, okay?
Get some sleep.

1293
01:45:00,637 --> 01:45:02,639
Hey!

1294
01:45:04,765 --> 01:45:06,726
Mama!

1295
01:45:08,603 --> 01:45:11,356
Mama! Mama!

1296
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:13,775
Wake up!

1297
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,778
You're hiding, huh?

1298
01:45:20,072 --> 01:45:22,033
I know that.

1299
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:26,787
Wake up!

1300
01:45:28,998 --> 01:45:33,085
Mama, wake up!

1301
01:46:05,284 --> 01:46:08,786
Mama, stop it now!

1302
01:46:08,869 --> 01:46:10,997
Stop, Mama!

1303
01:46:14,417 --> 01:46:16,002
Stop it.

1304
01:46:22,467 --> 01:46:25,303
Arnie? Arnie?

1305
01:46:27,929 --> 01:46:29,932
What's wrong?

1306
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,018
What's wrong? Stop it!

1307
01:46:33,143 --> 01:46:35,605
Gilbert!

1308
01:46:35,688 --> 01:46:37,689
Gilbert!

1309
01:46:39,107 --> 01:46:41,360
- Arnie!
- Don't... Give me... Stop!

1310
01:47:21,314 --> 01:47:23,277
Mom!

1311
01:47:36,454 --> 01:47:38,624
I'm gonna need
some more men, Amy.

1312
01:47:40,042 --> 01:47:43,754
Hey, flash the lights.
Flash 'em.

1313
01:47:43,879 --> 01:47:47,382
<i>You may need the National Guard
to move her out of there.</i>

1314
01:47:47,465 --> 01:47:49,467
I'm sorry about that.

1315
01:48:00,604 --> 01:48:03,105
I-It's gonna take a crane
to get her out.

1316
01:48:07,569 --> 01:48:09,778
There's gonna be a crowd.

1317
01:48:11,573 --> 01:48:14,033
I just know
there's gonna be a crowd.

1318
01:49:23,308 --> 01:49:25,519
She's so beautiful.

1319
01:49:25,644 --> 01:49:28,313
She's no joke. She's no joke.

1320
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,618
I'm not gonna let her be a joke.

1321
01:50:01,846 --> 01:50:03,514
Arnie.

1322
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,978
We're gonna need your help.

1323
01:53:20,665 --> 01:53:23,167
Gilbert, is that them?

1324
01:53:23,251 --> 01:53:25,710
No. No, not yet.

1325
01:53:25,794 --> 01:53:29,214
- When are they gonna come?
- Pretty soon.

1326
01:53:29,297 --> 01:53:31,509
Pretty soon.

1327
01:53:31,592 --> 01:53:34,261
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 19.

1328
01:53:35,387 --> 01:53:38,556
Nineteen.

1329
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:41,267
Gilbert, look there!

1330
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:43,895
Amy got a job offer
to manage a bakery in Des Moines.

1331
01:53:43,978 --> 01:53:45,647
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's them.

1332
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:48,483
Ellen can't wait
to switch schools.

1333
01:53:48,566 --> 01:53:50,402
Arnie asked if we were gonna
go, too, and I said...

1334
01:53:50,485 --> 01:53:55,114
"Well, we can go anywhere
if we want.

1335
01:53:55,197 --> 01:53:58,200
- Becky!
