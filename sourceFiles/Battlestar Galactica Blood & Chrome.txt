00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:30,655
WILLIAM: Dear Dad,

2
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,865
in your last letter, you questioned whether

3
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,201
it's my responsibility to join this fight.

4
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,705
The truth is

5
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,999
we all became responsible the
day we created the Cylons.

6
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,256
We're the ones who let these
robots become our servants,

7
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,134
our trusted helpers and even our friends.

8
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,510
We let them into our lives,

9
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,220
only to see them repay our trust

10
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,222
with a violent revolt against us.

11
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,311
I know there's a lot of debate
about why they hate us.

12
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,525
But in the end, does it really matter?

13
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,820
Kill the enemy or be killed.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,989
That's a reality.

15
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,118
In a war where mankind's very
survival hangs in the balance,

16
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,538
it's up to each of us to make a difference.

17
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,333
Being a pilot is the best
way I know how to do that.

18
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,670
Your loving son, William Adama.

19
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,513
WILLIAM: Hold still,
you toaster bastards.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,393
MAN ON RADIO:
Watch out, hotshot,
got a bandit on your 6.

21
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,854
That's fine, just adds to the challenge.

22
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,400
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

23
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,615
Come on, kid,
break off! Break off!

24
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,408
No way! I got this!

25
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,460
Come on. Come on.

26
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,878
Yeah!

27
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,715
Whoa!
(ALARM BLARING)

28
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,386
Frak. I can't see.

29
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,556
You got no visibility, kid.
Get out of there.

30
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,562
Watch your back, kid, he's coming around again.

31
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,898
(ALARM CONTINUES BLARING)

32
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,821
(ALARM BEEPING)

33
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,156
There we go. Much better.

34
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,492
What, are you crazy, Ensign?
Return to base.

35
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,619
You can't take that kind of radiation exposure.

36
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,329
You'll die in less than 30 seconds.

37
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,421
Twenty seconds and counting.

38
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,091
You're approaching radiation exposure max.

39
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,013
Frak, my gun's jammed.

40
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,599
You only have 12 seconds left.

41
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,684
Frak that.

42
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,274
Okay. Game over.

43
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,900
Are you crazy?
You can't fire your...

44
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,120
Yeah ! (LAUGHS)

45
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,455
Deal with it, sucker!

46
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,333
Come on. Tell me
that ain't a record.

47
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,920
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Congratulations, Ensign.
You have completed Level 6.

48
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,464
(LAUGHING)

49
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,884
Good sim score?
WILLIAM: No, no.

50
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,720
Not a good sim score.
The top sim score.

51
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,805
JENNA: Mmm.
I'm impressed.

52
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,807
Thanks. I'd be,
if I were you.

53
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,810
(CHUCKLES) Uh-oh.
Look out, Jenna, we've got a live one.

54
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,230
Let me guess, you're fresh out of the Academy,

55
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,316
you've been itching to fly Vipers
since you were in short pants,

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,526
but your only worry now
is that the war will be over

57
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,529
before you get a chance to prove
what a bona fide ace you are.

58
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:02,491
Congratulations. You got me pegged,
except for the worrying part.

59
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,659
I don't do that.

60
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,037
Oh, look at the pair on you.

61
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,413
Was that a request?

62
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,497
(CHUCKLES) No.

63
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,250
No. Don't get your hopes up, rook.
You're not my type.

64
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,669
No? Good.
So it's a date.

65
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,546
Easy. Down, boy.
Oh, man.

66
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,923
You're a real charger, aren't you, rook?

67
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,007
Thank you.

68
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,843
(LAUGHS)
You looking for some action?

69
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,721
There's the girl that's gonna give it to you.

70
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,567
Godsdamn!

71
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,387
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

72
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,307
Yo, rook, you're blocking traffic.

73
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,392
Sorry.

74
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,523
That's Deke Tornvald.

75
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,899
"The Minute Man."

76
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,276
Heard of him, huh?

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,528
Heard of him?
He was, like, my hero at the Academy.

78
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,071
What's he got now, like 30 kills?

79
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,615
Better hurry or there won't
be any left for you, ace.

80
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,117
DIAZ: McGavin.

81
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,495
Back just in time.
Suit up. Briefing in 30.

82
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,122
Another snowball patrol, sir?
Yeah.

83
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,832
What's this? Fresh meat?

84
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,168
Ensign William Adama, reporting
for flight duty, sir.

85
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,502
If there's a mission, I'd like to be part of it.

86
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,837
Good. Papers.

87
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,256
At ease.

88
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,468
You're FOB, Ensign.

89
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,053
Sure you don't want to find your rack first?

90
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,722
Respectfully, sir, I signed on
to kill toasters, not take naps.

91
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,391
Just point me at my plane and I'll get started.

92
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,393
All right, Ensign,

93
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,479
I'm assigning you to the Weasel.
She's right over there.

94
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,400
She's beautiful, sir.

95
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,319
Not the Viper, rook.
The bird behind her.

96
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,491
(CHUCKLES)

97
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,786
That old flying pillbox, sir?

98
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,788
It's a Raptor. That's the
designation and you're qualified.

99
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,414
No, sir, there has to be some kind...
Respectfully.

100
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,750
Respectfully, sir, there is a mistake.

101
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,586
I did not rate top of my class
so I could drive a bus.

102
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,879
I'm a Viper pilot.

103
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,130
Congratulations.

104
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,465
I'll break it down for you like this.

105
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,384
The brass makes it seem like Operation
Clean Sweep lived up to its name,

106
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,720
but somebody forgot to give
the toasters that memo.

107
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,931
They're taking down our planes right and left.

108
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,684
And right now I need Raptor drivers
more than I need Viper jocks.

109
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,687
So make sure your bus is ready for action.

110
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,898
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,108
Good.

112
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,692
Dismissed.

113
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,493
Oh.

114
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,708
Oh!

115
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,046
Frak! I am so sorry.
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,507
I just finished mucking this whole thing out!

117
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,467
I'm sorry. I didn't see what
was going on. I'm sorry.

118
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,469
Yeah, of course you didn't
because you weren't looking!

119
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,681
What are you doing in here?

120
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,641
Are you with the godsdamn press tour?

121
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,393
No.

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,478
I'm William Adama.
I was just assigned to fly this bird

123
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,521
so I came to get acquainted.

124
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,939
You?

125
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,899
You're my new driver?
Yeah.

126
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,902
They sent me a rook fresh
off the boat? Great.

127
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,489
Guess you must be
my new co-pilot.

128
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,408
Not if I can do something about it, I'm not.

129
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,953
I want new gyros on there this
time or I will be pissed off.

130
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,163
MAN: I'm working
on it, Lieutenant.

131
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,373
Here, let me help you with all this.

132
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,086
COKER: Just leave it.
Just leave it.

133
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,963
I said leave it alone.

134
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,756
Fasjovik?

135
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,259
Frak. You gotta call me
something, call me Coker.

136
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,844
Just don't get too familiar with it.

137
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,012
Okay.

138
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,974
So, Coker, who was your last pilot?

139
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,394
Just mopping up what's left of him.

140
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,609
Frakking knuckle-draggers.

141
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,822
Poor bastard.
Who the frak signs up for a third tour?

142
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,119
Hey, look, I'm sorry about your friend.

143
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,371
He wasn't my frakking friend!
He was an asshole.

144
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,166
And he was worth 10 huskers like you!

145
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,836
MAN ON PA: Lieutenant Fasjovik
and Ensign Adama,
please report to the CO.

146
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,005
Briefing call.

147
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,216
Here we go again.

148
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,427
Just listen real good and try not
to get us killed, okay, rook?

149
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,805
And you better clean up.
This ain't one of your barnyard tractor pulls.

150
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,058
WILLIAM: Um,
I'm from Caprica City.

151
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,435
Yeah, tell that to someone who cares, Husker.

152
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,614
(MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO)

153
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,369
You gonna offer the Commander a drink?

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,788
What?
Flask.

155
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,539
Frak.

156
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,416
SOLDIER: Let's go.

157
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,510
Sir.

158
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,719
Mr. Fasjovik.

159
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,682
Forty-seven days left
in your mandatory second tour.

160
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,766
Planning on re-upping?

161
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,268
Not if I get a say in it, sir.

162
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,312
Hard to part with an experienced
officer, but that's your call.

163
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,022
Clean up that image.
WOMAN: Yes, sir.

164
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,524
Ensign William Adama.

165
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,194
Caprican, but with some very
interesting Tauron family connections.

166
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,988
The Ha'la'tha?

167
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,491
Can't see that my family has anything
to do with this mission, sir.

168
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,160
Relax, son. I'd never judge
a man on his father's sins.

169
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,121
Or merits.

170
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,749
Your grades at the Academy
weren't exactly stellar,

171
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,586
but your flight instructor says
you were a "natural." I quote,

172
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,048
"One of the best pilot
candidates I have ever seen.

173
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,301
"And unfortunately,
he knows it."

174
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,304
You're a cocky son of a
bitch, aren't you, Ensign?

175
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,973
Yes, you are.

176
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,059
So is this an accurate assessment, son?
Are you a natural?

177
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,770
I can fly a plane, sir.

178
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,063
A "natural," I can't say.

179
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,940
Is that mine, Mr. Sig?
MAN: Yes, sir.

180
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,025
Thank you.

181
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,360
We are 10 years into a bad war, son,

182
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,572
so now this is how I handle cocky
sons of bitches on my ship.

183
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,910
I assign them to milk runs until they cool down.

184

Mr. Fasjovik?

186

Not at all, sir.

187
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,793
You boys are going to take some
cargo to the Scorpion shipyards.

188
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,420
You are going to return with spare parts.

189
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,088
Four-day round trip.

190
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,342
I'd assign a jump-capable
ship if I could afford one,

191
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,802
but I cannot, so your sorry-ass
Raptor will have to do.

192
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,389
Above all, you are to avoid any enemy contact.

193
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,642
That includes Cylon ships, SAMs, slingshots,

194
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,020
and anything else they might happen
to have floating around out there.

195
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,105
Understood?
Yes, sir.

196
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,150
Gentlemen, do not frak this up.

197
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,320
Come on. "Milk run"?

198
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,821
I said I didn't want to drive a bus,

199
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,448
now he's got me driving
a frakking delivery truck.

200
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,409
Hell, yeah.
Only thing better is if he'd make it

201
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,663
a regular trip, say for the next,
I don't know, month or so.

202
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,125
You're really getting out?
Like a shot, kid.

203
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,295
And go back to what? Where?

As long as it's far away from here.

Sir, I just wanted to say

208
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,527
I've been following your record

209
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,320
since you first joined the Squadron.

210
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,824
Someday I hope to be half the pilot you are.

211
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,076
I'll let you in on a little secret, kid.

212
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,916

bust us down and he says,

"You know what I do?
I'm gonna send you on a godsdamn milk run."

That's it.

We're going out.
It's gonna be two days out, two days back.

booked a bona fide pleasure cruise.

Our flight time to Scorpion
is approximately two days,

00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,372
during which we hope to
encounter absolutely nothing.

284

Fortunately, you'll find a wide range
of fine holoband entertainments

285
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,169
to help you pass the time.

No.
No.

00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,529
Good. If you'll open this,
you'll find a new set of orders.

I'm calling Galactica.
No, you're not.

Excuse me?
The orders specify wireless silence.

307
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,566
That means no contact with Galactica

00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,837
It is, it's Valkyrie.
That's not possible.

523
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,631
Valkyrie was destroyed on Canceron Prime.

524
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,926
No, it was reported destroyed.
See that heavy cruiser over there?

525
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,886
That's the Loki.

526
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:51,182
She was reported lost.
Presumed destroyed, too.

527
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,896
COKER: It's a fleet of ghost ships
hiding out in Cylon space.

528
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,247
SOLDIERS: Get out!
Get out! Get out!

529
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,873
Get out!
I'm fine.

530
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,167
SOLDIER 1: Move out!
People, move!

531
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:19,293
Come on.

532
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,046
SOLDIER 2: Your hands up!
SOLDIER 3: On your knees.

533
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,422

534
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,632
(GROANS)

535
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,884
I just want to speak to the
commander of this ship.

536
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,386
Shut up.

537
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,137
You tell me who you are
and how you found this fleet.

538
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,139
Take these to your commanding officer.

539
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,975
They'll confirm my identity and mission.

540
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,480
They're not exactly going all out
to make us feel welcome, are they?

541
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,983
Reminds me of Colonial Day
at my mother-in-law's.

542
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,192
SOLDIER 4: Shut up.

543
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,153
You're married?

544
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,657
Do you see a ring on my finger?

545
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,201
Stand her up.
Hold still.

546
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,095
(BEEPS)

547
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,002
Commander will see you in her quarters.

548
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,587
Pick it up.

549
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,005
All right, all right, all right.

550
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,514
OZAR: Get the Admiral
on the horn.

551
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,267
Tell him I'm coming aboard to brief
him on a priority one mission.

552
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,103
Fit Osiris out for a 12-league jump,
and tell him I'm gonna need 10

553
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,396
of his new Mark Threes loaded for bear

554
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,690
and prepped for atmospheric insertion.

555
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,276
Oh, and detail a Raptor
for Dr. Kelly here.

556
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,069
WILLIAM: Commander.

557
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,696

Squadron Victor-Alpha-42,
Galactica.

560
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,328
We brought Dr. Kelly here

561
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,788
and I would like to volunteer
our bird for this mission.

562
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,165
How long you been flying, junior?

563
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,125
This is my first op, sir.

564
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,712
But my ECO and I have already taken
out two Cylon SAMs and three Raiders.

565
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,090
Three bandits?
In a Raptor? That true?

566
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,218
It's true enough.

567
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,555
Well, thanks, son, but I think we'll go ahead

568
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,224
and use one of our own birds on this one.

569
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,893
Commander.

570
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,228
Excuse me.

571
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,064
Commander.

572
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,900
These men have gotten me this far in one piece.

573
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,110
I'd like to stick with them if it's all right.

574
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,493
Have it your way.

575
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,078
Thank you, Commander.

576
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,876
Make sure the other pilots are volunteers, too.

577
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,671
Um...

578
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:32,635
Did you just hear that?
Volunteers.

579
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,262
So?

580
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:40,142
So, congratulations, Husker.
You just signed us up for a one-way trip.

581
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:56,409
OZAR: We're on course to Djerba, a
former winter resort moon in Sector 12.

582
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,829
Cylons took it over early in the
war as a strategic outpost.

583
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,247
Now, it's so deep in their space

584
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,040
that intel says it's mostly unguarded.

586
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,919
but no Basestars.

A spec ops Marine reckon team
has already been inserted.

588
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,758
Our job is to deliver Dr.
Kelly safely to the operators,

589
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,803
then bug out, let them take her the
rest of the way to her objective.

590
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,390
I want all Vipers prepped by 1400,

591
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,434

00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,092
That was a heck of a surprise, man.

601
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:58,137
I read your name on a casualty
list when the Valkyrie, you know,

602
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,555
supposedly bought it.

603
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,766
Yeah, well, we almost did.
Ship was shot to hell.

604
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,017
But then Command saw that she could be salvaged,

605
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,393
and they saw an opportunity.

606
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,979
Right, you assemble a fleet of dead ships

607
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,689
and hit them when they least expect it.
That's good.

608

JIM: Talk about
creepy, though.

609
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,942
They made us witness our own death certificates.

610
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,778
Are you frakking kidding me?

611
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,696
"Give your all for the war," right?

612
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,823
Yeah, "Us or them."

613
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,036
So, I'm guessing that

614
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,165
you being dead and all, you haven't
had a chance to talk to Janey?

615
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,126
No.

616
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,338
I saw her.

617
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,341
I had a couple of days' leave over on Picon.

618
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,301
So what are you gonna tell me now?
She's remarried?

619
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,012
Not that I blame her.

00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,229

He's got her nose.

gonna pick us up on dradis soon,

us if we try to launch.

878

Maybe later.

880
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,551

I'm sorry

883
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:35,188
I couldn't get here any quicker
after I saw your signal.

884
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,106
Speaking of which, who's got that bitch?

885
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,864
Right now, we don't need any more company.

886
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,158
Is that how they found your unit?

887
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,118
Toasters didn't find them.

888
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,120
We were breaking camp in this cave.

889
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,122

reconnoiter the neighborhood,

890
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,541

00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,212

How long to get us to my objective?

900
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,022
Yeah, well, storm's getting worse

901
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:19,524
and you don't want to be out there when it does.

902
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,693
Plus, there's a toaster patrol
that I've been eyeballing

903
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,194
and they see better in this crap than we do.

904
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,988
No, I'm sorry, but I've got a timetable.

905
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,948
I can't just sit around and
wait for this storm to pass.

906
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,658
I think it's gonna blow over by morning.

907
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,577
Plus, I got a secure location where
we can hole up for the night.

908
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:32,954
You want to pack that to go?

909
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,455
Yeah, no, we just ate.

910
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,249

I'm not frakking going with you.

That's your secure location?
A frakking ski lodge?

921
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,513
Toasters used it as a storage
facility after the initial attack.

922
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:34,307
Then they just abandoned it.

923
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,100
What were they storing?

924
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,271

Was he a computer nerd, like you?

952
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,424
He was a professor, thank you very much.

953
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,052
An historian who woke up one day

954
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:19,472
and decided he couldn't just sit
back and watch history pass him by.

955
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,060
He never wanted to be a hero, but
they turned him into one anyway.

Yeah, I'll make a bed over there.

What you don't remember,
because they never let it out,

962
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,998
is that afterwards a reporter found
out it was all a fabrication.

963

A lie.

964
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,172
He didn't take out a Cylon platoon.

up by men from his own unit.

01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:07,823
Tough motherfrakker just took out two more.

1051
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,533
He's not gonna make it.

1052
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,454
I got his wireless.

1053
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,623
Why?

1054
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,458
Why do you think?

1055
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,044
Fun and games are over.
I'm sending the evac code.

1056
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:22,504
We're getting the frak out of here.
No. No.

1057
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,172
Crazy. Are you nuts?
Nope.

1058
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,508
Look, we complete this mission,

1059
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,260
then you can send whatever
code you want, all right?

1060
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,345
COKER: Look, kid,
unless you haven't noticed,

1061
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,139
we're fresh out of Marines and ammo.

1062
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,640
I'm not trained for this.
I noticed.

1063
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,019
So we're going to have to make do, all right?

1064
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,564
Where are we going?

1065
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:42,774
It's an automated transmission array.

1066
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,111
You need to put your gun down, Husker.

1067
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,613
Put it down.

1068
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,408
Coker, what are you doing?

1069
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,618
Look, you guys want to die heroes right now?

1070
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,454
I can do that for you, right now.

1071
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,542
Test me, Husker.

1072
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,633
Coker, what are you doing?

1073
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,719
Why are you doing this?

1074
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:11,803
I can't take it.

1075
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,057
Please, put the gun down.

1076
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,391
WILLIAM: Come on.

1077
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:19,394
All right, it's gone.

1078
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,773
You tell me why we're here, right now.

1079
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,816
Don't do this.
Tell me why we're here!

1080
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,114
This war isn't going nearly as
well as the government claims.

1081
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,324
I know.

1082
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:35,494
This surprise attack is a last roll of the die.

1083
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,330
If it fails, we fail, and it will fail

1084
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,458
if you don't get me where I need to go.

1085
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:42,834
She's talking sense.

1086
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:44,544
Coker, please.

1087
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,296
So now we need to know.

1088
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,632
You tell me why we're here.

1089
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:52,219
It's an automated Cylon transmission array.

1090
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:56,056
Once we gain access, I will upload a virus.

1091
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:02,020
Can you please take the gun off my chest?

1092
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,190
Please.

1093
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:08,777
Keep talking.

1094
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,199
I will upload a virus that is
designed to blind their defenses.

1095
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,701
A virus I have been carrying in this.

1096
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,293
What, you didn't trust me
enough to tell me this before?

1097
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,297
No. I'm sorry.

1098
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,050
I trust you now.

1099
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,387
Good.

1100
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,015
Then we're communicating.

1101
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:42,769
Tell us the rest.

1102
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:47,232
Make sure there are no more surprises.

1103
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:52,863
BECCA: Like I said, it's an
automated Cylon transmission array

1104
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:56,741
about six klicks from here, so if we leave
now, we'll make it before nightfall.

1105
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,500
The facility is automated,

1106
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,545
so we shouldn't run into
too many Centurion guards.

1107
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:11,923
That is, if we're careful not to
trip the internal defense systems.

1109

The central corridor leads
directly to the control room.

1110
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:27,022
We'll need to access one of their
com channels to upload the virus.

1111
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,941
A virus that is designed to spread
through their entire network

1112
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,152
and lie dormant until we trigger it,

1113
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:35,614
disabling all of their communications
in advance of an attack.

1115

What is it?

1116
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,100
Thought I saw something.

1117
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:06,895
Guess I'm just jumpy.

1118
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,410
We're in.

1119
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,955
Come on, Becca, hurry with that
thing, all right? Come on.

1120
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:26,289

1127
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:42,722

She's a Cylon spy!

1128
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,349
No.

How the frak do I stop this thing?

1130
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,186
A spy? Coker,
how could she be a spy?

1131
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:49,771
Ask her about the hotel.

1132
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:52,190
About the Cylon that stopped and scanned her.

1133
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:53,984
What? I don't know what
you're talking about.

1134

What hotel? That frakking
toaster had you dead to rights

1135
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,779
and then it saw this thing and it froze.

1136

Can you explain that to me?

Can you?

I have no idea what you're
talking about. Coker.

1139

Put the gun down on the
floor and calm down, okay?

1140

Drop the gun.
Oh, frak.

1141
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,668

What?
Oh, frak!

1143
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:15,797

It'll end when we realize that we can't win.

1155

That we have to negotiate.

1156
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,201
Negotiate?

1157
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:48,246
For the last 10 years they've
been trying to wipe us out.

1158

defending themselves.

01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,914
For a while anyway, they're
going to be on the defensive.

1225
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:29,373
And what about the Osiris?

1226
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,877
What about all those people who died?

1227
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:36,547
You mean all those people
who gave their lives. Right?

1228
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:42,220
You disapprove?
Yes.

1229
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:43,721
You feel used?
Mmm-hmm.

1230
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,890
Well, I'm sorry, son, but there's
a bit more at stake here

1231
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,725
than your personal sense of integrity.

1232
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:52,563
The truth is that the people
support this war with their money,

1233
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,899
and they will stop if we stop giving them hope.

1234
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:57,902
So let them have their heroes,

1235
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,529
let them have their unblemished victories,

1236
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,405
while you and I fight the real war.

1237
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:03,241
Yes?

1238
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:17,755
Good.

1239
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:23,594
We're assembling a joint task force.

1240
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:25,888
Our best pilots, Marines and infantry units

1241
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:27,932
for special ops throughout the war theater.

1242
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,643
In case you want to volunteer,

1243
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,436
there's a shiny new Viper with your name on it

1244
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:33,980
waiting for you in the hangar bay.

1245
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:36,649
Well, maybe not with your name on it just yet.

1246
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:39,527
I hear you still have to pick out a call sign.

1247
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:43,239
You think about it.
Yeah.

1248
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:02,300
(CHUCKLES)

1249
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:06,220
What? No cocky comebacks?

1250
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:11,225
You look like shit.

1251
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,560
(LAUGHS)

1252
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:14,729
You're one to talk.

1253
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,570
You going home?

1254
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:27,700
Well, I got six weeks left in my tour,

1255
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:29,493
so I figure I'll stick around that long.

1256
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,830
Long as I don't have to fly with you.

1257
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,126
(MOUTHING)

1258
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,680
(LAUGHS)

1259
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,272
WILLIAM: Dear Dad,
I got your last letter.

1260
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:01,192
You're right about
preconceptions being dangerous,

1261
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,860
and not just in court.

1262
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:05,613
This war is turning out to be
different than I expected.

1263
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,699
But maybe my mistake was to have expectations.

1264
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,953
It's something you have to live
inside of to really understand.

1265
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:15,122
While a part of me already hates it,

1266
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:17,875
another part knows that I'll
make soldiering my life.

1267
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,419
But this is the life I've chosen,

1268
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:23,464
and this crew, it's my family now, too.

1269
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,050
Because I'll tell you something else,

1270
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:30,304
when this war is over, and some day it will be,

1271
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:33,015
what I'll remember most are not the battles,

1272
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,393
but the men and women who fought them with me.

1273
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:37,478
And I will miss them.
