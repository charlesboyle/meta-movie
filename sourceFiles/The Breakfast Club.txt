Saturday, March 24, 1984.

24
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:18,092
Shermer High School,
Shermer, Illinois, 60062.

25
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,540
"Dear Mr. Vernon...

26
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:29,910
"We accept the fact that
we had to sacrifice a whole
Saturday in detention...

27
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:32,711
"for whatever it was
we did wrong.

28
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:34,580
"What we did was wrong...

29
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:40,819
"but we think you're crazy to make us
write an essay telling you who we are.

00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:42,883
"What do you care?

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,521
"You see us
as you want to see us...

32
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:50,363
"in the simplest terms, with the most
convenient definitions.

00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:52,902
"You see us as a brain...

"an athlete, a basket case...

"That's the way we saw each other
at 7:00 this morning.

00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:13,556
We were brainwashed. '

40
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:27,701
I can't believe
you can't get me out of this.
[Sighs]

41
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:32,766
It's so absurd I have to
be here on a Saturday.

42
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:35,607
It's not like
I'm a defective or anything.

43
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,170
I'll make it up to you.

44
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:40,581
Honey, ditching class to go shopping
doesn't make you a defective.

45
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,949
Have a good day.

46
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:52,252
Is this the first time
or last time we do this?
Last.

47
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,060
Well, get in there and use the time
to your advantage.

48
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:57,930
Mom, we're not supposed to study.
We have to sit there and do nothing.

49
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:01,130
Well, mister, you figure out
a way to study.
Yeah.

50
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,502
Well, go.

51
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:13,643
Hey, I screwed around.

52
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:16,585
Guys screw around.
There's nothing wrong with that...

53
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:20,920
except you
got caught, sport.
Yeah, Mom already reamed me.

54
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,654
You want to miss a match?
You want to blow your ride?

55
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:28,222
Now, no school is gonna give
a scholarship to a discipline case.

Well, well.
Here we are.

59
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,887
I wanna congratulate you
for being on time.

60
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:07,761
Excuse me, sir?
I think there's been a mistake.

61
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:12,201
I know it's detention but, um,
I don't think I belong in here.

62
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:18,474
It is now 7:06.

63
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:23,309
You have exactly eight hours
and fifty-four minutes to
think about why you're here.

64
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:27,215
Ponder the error
of your ways.
[Hawks, Spits]

65
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:29,752
- [Gasps]
- You may not talk.

66
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,383
You will not move
from these seats.

67
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,692
And you...
will not sleep.

68
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,363
All right, people,
we're going to try something
a little different today.

69
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:55,811
We are going to write an essay...
of no less than a thousand words...

70
00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:01,045
describing to me
who you think you are.
Is this a test?

71
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:05,748
And when I say essay,
I mean essay.

72
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:11,159
I do not mean a single word
repeated a thousand times.

73
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:15,289
- Is that clear, Mr. Bender?
- Crystal.

74
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:19,029
Good. Maybe you'll learn
something about yourself.

75
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:22,800
Maybe you'll even decide
whether or not
you care to return.

76
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:26,309
Uh, I can answer
that right now, sir.

77
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:29,642
- That'd be no for me, 'cause...
- Sit down, Johnson.

78
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:32,045
Thank you, sir.

79
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:38,378
My office is right across
that hall. Any monkey business
is ill-advised.

80
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:41,186
Any questions?

81
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:44,786
Yeah. I got a question.

82
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:47,888
Does Barry Manilow know
that you raid his wardrobe?

83
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:51,162
I'll give you the answer to that question,
Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

84
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,934
Don't mess with the bull,
young man, you'll get the horns.

85
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,673

a brownie hound.

I've seen you before,
you know.

[Under Breath]
Who I think I am.

94
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:56,626
Who are you?

95
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,191
Who are you?

96
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:03,038
I am a walrus.

I can't believe
this is really happening to me.

Oh, shit!

103
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:16,376
What are we supposed to
do if we have to piss?
Please.

104
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,644
If you got to go,
you got to go.
[Zipper Unzips]

[Grunts]
Oh, my God.

106
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:23,878
You're not
urinating in here, man.
Don't talk. Don't talk.

107
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:27,651
- It makes it crawl back up.
- You whip it out, you're dead
before the first drop hits.

108
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:33,554
You're pretty sexy
when you get angry.
[Growls]

109
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,660
Hey, homeboy, why don't you
go close that door.

110
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:41,398
We'll get the prom queen
impregnated.

111
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,631
Hey. Hey.!

112
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,370
- What?
- If I lose my temper,
you're totaled, man.

113
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:51,881
- Totally?
- Totally.

114
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:55,350
Why don't you shut up?
Nobody here's interested.

115
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:59,545
Really. Buttface.

116
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:04,322
Hey, sporto, what'd you do
to get in here?
Forget to wash your jock?

117
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:07,228
Uh, excuse me, fellas,
I think we should
just write our papers.

118
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,698
Just because you live in here
doesn't give you the right
to be a pain in the ass.

119
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:13,862
So knock it off!
It's a free country.

120
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:17,839
He's just doing it
to get a rise out of you.
Just ignore him.

Sweets.

122
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:24,074
You couldn't ignore me
if you tried.

123
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:28,349
So...

124
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,944
so...

125
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,715
are you guys like
boyfriend-girlfriend?

126
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,192
Steady dates?

127
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:42,561
Lovers?

128
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:45,966
Come on, sporto.
Level with me.

129
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,596
Do you slip her
the hot-beef injection?

130
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:51,140
Go to hell!
Enough!

131
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,699
Hey! What's going on
in there?

132
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:57,046
Spoiled little pricks.

133
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:04,720
Scumbag.

134
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:09,589
What do you say
we close that door?

135
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,220
Can't have any kind of party with Vernon
checking us every few seconds.

136
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,287
You know the door's
supposed to stay open.

137
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:16,229
So what?
So why don't you
just shut up.

138
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,133
- There's four other
people in here, you know?
- God, you can count.

139
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,262
I knew you had to be smart
to be a wrestler.

140
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:23,932
Who the hell are you
to judge anybody anyway?
Really.

141
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,601
[Boy]
You know, Bender,
you don't even count.

142
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:29,669
If you disappear forever,
it wouldn't make any difference.

143
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,739
You may as well not even
exist at this school.

144
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:37,782
Well, I'll run right out
and join the wrestling team.

145
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:42,485
- [Both Chuckle]
- Maybe the prep club too.
Student council.

146
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,618
Nah.
They wouldn't take you.

147
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:47,926
- I'm hurt.
- You know why guys like you
knock everything?

148
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:50,432
This should be stunning.
Because you're afraid.

149
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:54,665
Oh, God. You richies are
so smart. That's exactly why
I'm not heavy in activities.

150
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:58,003
- You're a big coward.
- I'm in a Math Club.

151
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:02,409
You're afraid that they won't
take you, you don't belong,
so you dump all over it.

152
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:07,781
Well, it wouldn't have anything
to do with you activities
people being assholes, would it?

153
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:10,513
Well, you wouldn't know.
You don't even know any of us.

154
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:12,782
Well, I don't know
any lepers either...

155
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,188
but I'm not going to run
and join one of their fucking clubs.

156
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:18,057
Hey, let's watch
the mouth, huh?
I'm in Physics Club too.

157
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:21,393
Excuse me a sec.
What are you babbling about?

158
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:24,628
What I said was that
I'm in the Math Club...

159
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:27,864
uh, the Latin Club
and the Physics Club... Physics Club.

160
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,672
Hey. Cherry.

161
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:36,845
Do you belong to
the Physics Club?

162
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:40,247
That's an academic club.
So?

163
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,846
Academic clubs aren't the same
as other kinds of clubs.

164
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:48,380
Ah, but to dorks
like him, they are.

165
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,657
What do you guys
do in your club?

166
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:57,393
In physics, well, we talk about physics.
Properties of physics.

167
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:02,666
So it's sort of social.
Demented and sad, but social, right?

168
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,731
[Johnson] I guess
you could consider it
a social situation.

169
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:10,439
Um, I mean, there are
other children in my club. And, uh...

170
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:14,712
at the end of the year, we have, um,
we have a big banquet at the Hilton.

171
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:17,049
You load up. You party.

172
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,750
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

173
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:26,125
- Only burners like you get high.
- And I didn't have any shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

174
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,858
It's weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me
to wear other people's shoes.

175
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:33,062
My counsel kent...
My cousin Kendall from Indiana,
he got high once.

176
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:35,969
And, you know, he started eating,
like, really weird foods.

177
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,032
Then he felt like he didn't
belong anywhere, kind of
like Twilight Zone, kinda?

178
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,944
- [Laughs] Sounds like you.
- You guys keep up your talking
and Vernon's gonna come in.

179
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:47,541
I got a meet this Saturday,
and I'm not gonna miss it
on account of you boneheads.

180
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,711
Oh, and wouldn't that
be a bite?
[Grunts]

181
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:51,720
Missing a whole
wrestling meet?

182
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,881
You wouldn't know
anything about it, faggot.

183
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,948
You never competed
in your whole life.

184
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:58,688
[Mock Crying]
Oh, I know. I feel
all empty inside because of it.

185
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:03,290
I have such a deep admiration
for guys who roll around
on the floor with other guys.

186
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:07,770
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.
Oh, but I do.

187
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:10,329
I want to be just like you.

188
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,467
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

189
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,403
You wear tights?

190
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,814
No, I don't wear tights.

191
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:23,682
- I wear the required uniform.
- Tights.

192
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:26,222
Shut up.

193
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:42,035
[Snorts]
Woo!

194
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,866
[Johnson]
There's not supposed to
be any monkey business.

195
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:50,607
Young man, have you
finished your paper?

196
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:57,043
[Boy]
Come on, Bender.
Don't screw around.

197
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,350
What are you
going to do?
Drop dead, I hope.

198
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,584
[Water Running]

199
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,062
[Shouts, Indistinct]
All right!

200
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:15,298
Bender, that's-that's
school property there,
and it doesn't belong to us.

201
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:18,739
- It's something not to be
toyed with.
- That's very funny. Fix it.

202
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,970
You should really fix that.
Am I a genius?

203
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:23,535
No, you're an asshole.
Fix the door, Bender.
What a funny guy.

204
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:26,548
Everyone, just shh.
I've been here before.
I know what I'm doing.

205
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,914
[Boy]
No. Fix the door.!
[Bender] Shut up.!

206
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:31,511
Goddamn it.!

207
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,115
Why is that door closed?

208
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:44,089
Why is that door closed?
How are we supposed to know?
We're not supposed to move.

209
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:51,339
- Why?
- We're just sitting here
like we're supposed to.

210
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,270
Who closed that door?

211
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,446
- I think a screw fell out of it.
- It just closed, sir.

212
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:06,779
Who?
[Squeaks]

213
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:10,224
- She doesn't talk, sir.
- [Girl Squeaks]

214
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:13,228
- [Vernon]
Give me that screw.
- I don't have it.

215
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,594
You want me to yank you
out of that seat?

216
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:19,692
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.
The world's an imperfect place.

217
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,635
Give it to me, Bender.

218
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:24,037
Excuse me, sir.
Why would anybody
want to steal a screw?

219
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:27,406
Watch it, young lady.

220
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:32,941
[Door Opens]

221
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,445
The door's
way too heavy, sir.

222
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:47,923
[Vernon]
Damn it.!
[Clattering]

223
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:56,132
Andrew Clark,
get up here.

224
00:17:56,206 --> 00:18:00,142
[Snaps Fingers]
Come on. Front and center.
Let's go.

225
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,701
- Hey, how come Andrew
gets to get up?
- That's right.

226
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:06,306
If he gets up, we'll all get up.
It'll be anarchy.!

227
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:11,276
Watch-Watch
the magazines.
It's out of my hands.

228
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:20,620
That's very clever, sir,
but what if there's a fire?

229
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:25,157
I think violating fire codes
and endangering the lives of children...

230
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,396
would be unwise at this juncture
in your career, sir.

231
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:30,963
All right. What are you doing
with this? Get this out of here,
for God's sake.

232
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,509
What's the matter with you?
Come on.

233
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:36,512
You know, the school
comes equipped with fire exits
at either end of the library.

234
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,981
- Show Dick some respect.
- Let's go.

235
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,518
Go. Get back in your seat.

236
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:48,683
I expected a little more
from a varsity letterman.

237
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,954
You're not fooling
anybody, Bender.

238
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:55,794
The next screw that
falls out is gonna be you.

239
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:59,962
- Eat my shorts.
- What was that?

240
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:05,540
Eat... my... shorts.

241
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,578
You just bought yourself
another Saturday, mister.

242
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,170
- Oh, I'm crushed.
- You just bought
one more right there.

243
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,184
Well, I'm free the Saturday
after that. Beyond that,
I'll have to check my calendar.

244
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:18,016
Good! Because it's gonna be filled.
We'll keep going.

245
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:21,819
You want another one?
Say the word. Just say the word.

246
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:25,726
Instead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

247
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:27,888
- Are you through?
- No.

248
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:31,661
I'm doing society a favor.
That's another right now.
So?

249
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:34,568
I've got you for the rest
of your life if you don't
watch your step.

250
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,629
You want another one?
Yes.

251
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:39,869
You got it.! You got
another one right there.
That's another one, pal.

252
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:42,002
Cut it out!

253
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,308
- [Mouthing]
Stop.
- You through?

254
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:47,373
Not even close, bud.

255
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,544
- You got one more right there.
- You really think I give a shit?

256
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,588
Another.

257
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,850
- You through?
- How many is that?

258
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,589
That's seven, including
the one when you asked
Mr. Vernon here...

259
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:01,858
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

260
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:04,423
- Now it's eight. Stay out of it.
- Excuse me, sir. It's seven.

261
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,026
Shut up, peewee.

262
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:14,573
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got ya.

263
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:17,112
I got ya.

264
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,081
What can I say?
I'm thrilled.

265
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,086
Oh, I sure that's exactly
what you want these people
to believe. You know something?

266
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:27,351
You ought to spend
a little more time trying to
do something with yourself...

267
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:30,291
and a little less time
trying to impress people.

268
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,091
You might be better off.
All right. That's it!

269
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:36,394
I'm gonna be
right outside those doors.

270
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:41,062
The next time
I have to come in here,
I'm cracking skulls.

271
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,409
Fuck you!

272
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,921
[Sighs]

273
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,352
Fuck.

274
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:49,588
Wake up!

275
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:55,196
Who has to go
to the lavatory?

276
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:17,855
- That's real intelligent.
- You're right.

277
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:19,918
It's wrong
to destroy literature.

278
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:22,829
It's such fun to read.

279
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:25,231
And...

280
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,764
"Molay" really pumps my nads.

281
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,570
Moliere.

282
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:36,937
I love his work.

283
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:50,091
Big deal. Nothing to do
when you're locked in a vacancy.

284
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,128
Speak for yourself.

285
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:57,861
Do you think I'd speak for you?
I don't even know your language.

286
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,665
Hey, you grounded tonight?

287
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:06,198
I don't know. My mom said I was.
My dad told me just to blow her off.

288
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:14,305
There's a big party at Stubby's.
His parents are in Europe.

289
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:17,842
It should be pretty wild.
Are you going to go?
Yeah?

290
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,682
- I doubt it.
- How come?

291
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:25,751
'Cause if I do what my mother
tells me not to do, it's because
my father says it's okay.

292
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,162
It's like this whole, big monster deal.
It's endless. It's a total drag.

293
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,166
It's like,
any minute, divorce.

294
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:34,692
- Who do you like better?
- What?

295
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:37,899
- You like your old man
better than your mom?
- They're both screwed.

296
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:40,465
No, I mean, if you had
to choose between 'em.

297
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,342
I don't know. Probably go live
with my brother.

298
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:51,720
I mean, I don't think either one
of them gives a shit about me.

299
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:54,916
- It's like they use me
to get back at each other.
- Ha!

300
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:07,496
- Shut up!
- You're just feeling
sorry for yourself.

301
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,936
Yeah, if I didn't,
nobody else would.

302
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:12,566
Oh, you're breaking
my heart. What?
Sporto?

303
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:17,579
You get along
with your parents?

304
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:20,241
Well, If I say yes,
I'm an idiot, right?

305
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:24,712
You're an idiot anyway.

306
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:28,450
But if you say you get along with
your parents, well, you're a liar too.

307
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:40,626
You know something, man?
If we weren't in school, I'd waste you.

308
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:43,536
Can you hear this?

309
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:47,269
You want me
to turn it up?

310
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:50,506
Hey, fellas, I mean...

311
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,879
I don't like my parents, either.
I mean, I don't...

312
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,717
I don't get along
with them when their idea
of parental compassion...

313
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:02,451
is just, you know,
wacko, you know.

314
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:04,925
Dork.
Yeah?

315
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:07,986
You are a parent's
wet dream, okay?

316
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,496
That's the problem.
Look, I can see you
getting all bunged up...

317
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:16,903
for them making you wear
these kind of clothes...

318
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:20,636
but, face it, you're
a neo-maxi-zoon-dweebie.

319
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,543
What would you be doing if
you weren't out making
yourself a better citizen?

320
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:26,776
Why do you have to
insult everybody?

321
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:29,340
I'm being honest,
asshole.

322
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,582
I would expect you
to know the difference.

323
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:35,488
Well, he's got a name.

It's a family name.

two kinds of fat people...

there's fat people
that were born to be fat...

that were once thin,
but they became fat.

Here's my impression of
the life at big Bri's house.

489
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:19,741
[Deep Voice] Son?
[Normal Voice]
Yeah, Dad?

490
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:23,080
How's your day, pal?
Great, Dad.

491
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:25,848
How's yours?
Super.

492
00:40:27,322 --> 00:40:32,453
Say, son, how'd you like
to go fishing this weekend?

493
00:40:32,528 --> 00:40:37,465
Great, Dad.
But I've got homework to do.

494
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:40,832
That's all right, son.
You can do it on the boat.

495
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:43,736
Gee.!

496
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:51,973
Dear, isn't our son swell?
Yes, dear.

497
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:55,016
Isn't life swell?

498
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,017
Oh.
[Loud Kiss]

499
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:59,019

[Grunts]

501
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:10,026
All right.
What about your family?

502
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,931
Who, mine?
It's real easy.
Yeah.

503
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,745
[Deep Voice]
Stupid, worthless,
no-good...

504
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:30,148
goddamn freeloading
son of a bitch.

505
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:33,882
Retarded, big mouth,
know-it-all, asshole, jerk.

506
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:40,622
[High Voice]
You forgot ugly,
lazy and disrespectful.

507
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:44,359
Shut up, bitch!
Go fix me a turkey potpie.

508
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:48,870
What about you, Dad?
[Deep Voice]
Fuck you.

509
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:51,804
No, Dad.
What about you?
Fuck you!

510
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:55,207
No, Dad. What about you?
Fuck you!

511
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:57,211
Bam!

512
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:03,213
- Is that for real?
- You want to come over sometime?

513
00:42:03,285 --> 00:42:05,685
That's bullshit.
It's all part of your image.

514
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:08,279
- I don't believe a word of it.
- You don't believe me?

515
00:42:08,357 --> 00:42:10,291
No.
No?

516
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:12,486
Did I stutter?

517
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:23,269
Do you
believe this? Huh?

518
00:42:24,973 --> 00:42:28,875
It's about
the size of a cigar.
Do I stutter?

519
00:42:28,944 --> 00:42:33,244
See, this is what you get
in my house when you spill
paint in the garage.

520
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:40,485
I don't think that
I need to sit with you
fucking dildos anymore.

[Yelling]

522
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:51,897
Fuck!

523
00:43:12,054 --> 00:43:14,887
- You shouldn't have said that.
- How did I know?

524
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:18,459
I mean he lies about
everything anyway.

525
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:39,675
Oh, shit.

526
00:43:39,748 --> 00:43:44,583
Coffee. Looks like it's
been scraped off the bottom
of the Mississippi River.

527
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:48,579
Everything's polluted.
Everything's polluted.

528
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:51,649
The coffee's polluted.
The kids are polluted.

529
00:44:03,972 --> 00:44:07,499
How do you know
where Vernon went?
I don't.

530
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:11,068
Then how do you know
when he'll be back?
I don't.

531
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:15,643
Being bad feels
pretty good. Huh?

532
00:44:17,953 --> 00:44:21,445
What's the point
of going to Bender's locker?
Beats me.

533
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:26,187
This is so stupid.
Why are we risking
getting caught?

534
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:28,752
I don't know.

535
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,924
So then what are we doing?
You ask me
one more question...

536
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,265
and I'm beating
the shit out of you.
Sorry.

537
00:44:40,442 --> 00:44:44,276
You're such a slob.
My maid's
on vacation.

538
00:44:58,326 --> 00:45:02,490
[Sniffing]
It's drugs.

539
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:04,532
Screw that, Bender.
Put it back.

540
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:07,261
Drugs.
The boy has marijuana.

541
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:12,604
That was marijuana.
Shut up, dick.

542
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:16,200
Do you approve
of this?

543
00:45:27,622 --> 00:45:30,090
[Bender]
We'll cross through the lab,
and then we'll double back.

544
00:45:30,158 --> 00:45:33,491
[Andrew] You better be right.
If Vernon cuts us off,
it's your fault, asshole.

We have to go through
the cafeteria.
No, the activities hall.

Hey, man, you don't know
what you're talking about.
You don't know.

Fuck you. Why didn't you
listen to John?

562
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:03,579
We're dead.

563
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:08,316
No. Just me.
What do you mean?

564
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:12,383

What are you doing here?
What is this?
Hi.

579
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:07,609
Out. That's it, Bender.
Out. It's over.

580
00:48:07,682 --> 00:48:10,913
Don't you want
to hear my excuse?
Out.

581
00:48:10,986 --> 00:48:13,318
I'm thinking of
trying out for a scholarship.

582
00:48:13,388 --> 00:48:16,880
Give me the ball, Bender.
Give me that ball.

583
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:38,736
Get your stuff.
Let's go.

Mr. Wise Guy here's
taken upon himself
to go to the gymnasium.

you're going to be without his

Everything's a big joke, huh, Bender?
The false alarm you pulled Friday...

588
00:48:53,662 --> 00:48:56,927
False alarms are really funny,
aren't they?

589
00:48:56,998 --> 00:49:00,297
What if your home...
What if your family...

590
00:49:00,368 --> 00:49:02,302
What if your dope was on fire?

591

Impossible, sir.
It's in Johnson's underwear.

You think he's funny?

You think this is cute?
You think he's bitchin'? Is that it?

594
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:17,481
Let me tell you something.
Look at him.

595
00:49:17,552 --> 00:49:19,611
He's a bum.

596
00:49:19,688 --> 00:49:22,885
You want to see something funny?
You go visit John Bender in five years.

597

You'll see how
goddamn funny he is.

598

You going to cry?

Keep your

That's the last time, Bender.

603
00:50:03,965 --> 00:50:07,264
That's the last time you ever
make me look bad in front of
those kids. You hear me?

604
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:10,065
I make $31,000 a year,
and I've got a home.

throw it away on some punk

going to do about it?

gonna believe you?

You think anybody is gonna
take your word over mine?

00:50:48,576 --> 00:50:51,067
I'm a man of respect around here.
They love me around here.

00:50:51,146 --> 00:50:55,446
I'm a swell guy.
You're a lying sack of shit,
and everybody knows it.

Hey, hey. Come on.

Let's find out how tough you are.

I wanna know, right now,
how tough you are. Come on.

00:51:07,962 --> 00:51:11,625
I'll give you
the first punch. Let's go.
Come on. Right here.

621
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:14,668
Just take the first shot.
Please. I'm begging you.
Take a shot. Right here.

622
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:17,569
Just take one shot.
That's all I need.

- What ruckus?

638
00:53:03,845 --> 00:53:05,710
I was in my office,

Was that the noise
you were talking about?

649
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,941
No, it wasn't.
That was not the noise
I was talking about.

650
00:53:39,013 --> 00:53:44,280
Now, I may not have caught you
in the act this time,

You're an asshole.

Hey, Carl. How you doing?
Good. What's up?

What are you doing
in the basement files?

Just doing a little homework.

Look, Carl. This is
a highly sensitive area,
and I tell you something.

694

hang out with them.

so many girlfriends?
- I asked you first.

threw anything away.

- Neither do I.
- Oh.

this much shit in your bag?

01:01:25,746 --> 01:01:27,680
Yeah.

this much shit in my bag.

you may have to jam.

Are you gonna be,
like, a shopping bag lady?

sit in alley ways...

747
01:01:42,496 --> 01:01:45,329
and talk to buildings
and wear men's shoes
and that kind of thing?

748
01:01:45,399 --> 01:01:47,959
I'll do what
I have to do.

749
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:51,334
Why do you have to
do anything?

750
01:01:51,405 --> 01:01:56,433
My home life...
is unsatisfying.

751
01:01:58,012 --> 01:02:00,242
So you're saying you'd subject yourself
to the violent dangers...

752
01:02:00,314 --> 01:02:03,806
of these Chicago streets
because your home life is unsatisfying?

753
01:02:03,884 --> 01:02:05,818
I don't have to run away
and live in the street.

754
01:02:05,886 --> 01:02:07,820
I can run away
and go to the ocean.

755
01:02:07,888 --> 01:02:09,822
I can go to the country,
to the mountains.

756
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:13,485
I could go to Israel,
Africa... Afghanistan.

757

on this?

758

she wants to run away...

759
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:31,977
because her home life
is unsatisfying.

760
01:02:33,514 --> 01:02:35,709
Well, everyone's home life
is unsatisfying.

761
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:40,478
And if it wasn't,
people would live
with their parents forever.

762
01:02:40,554 --> 01:02:43,785
Yeah, yeah, I understand,
but I think hers goes beyond...

763
01:02:43,858 --> 01:02:48,557
what, you know,
guys like you and me
consider normal unsatisfying.

764
01:02:48,629 --> 01:02:52,360
Never mind. Forget it.
Everything's cool.

765
01:02:52,433 --> 01:02:55,095
- What's the deal?
- No.

766
01:02:55,169 --> 01:02:57,535
There's no deal, sporto.

767
01:02:57,605 --> 01:03:00,335
Forget it.
Leave me alone.
Wait a minute.

768
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:03,433
You're carrying all that crap
around in your purse.

769
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:07,003
Either you really wanna
run away, or you want people
to think you wanna run away.

770
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:09,811
Eat shit!

771
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:15,783
The girl is an island
unto herself, okay?

772
01:03:25,232 --> 01:03:28,065
Hi.

773
01:03:28,135 --> 01:03:30,126
You wanna talk?
No.

774
01:03:30,204 --> 01:03:33,970
Why not?
Go away.

775
01:03:35,209 --> 01:03:37,939
Where do you
want me to go?
Go away!

776
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:51,583
- You have problems.
- Oh, I have problems.

777
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:54,628
You do everything
everybody tells you to do.
That is a problem.

778
01:03:54,695 --> 01:03:57,391
Okay, fine.
But I didn't dump my purse
out on the couch...

779
01:03:57,464 --> 01:04:02,993
and invite people
into my problems, did I?

780
01:04:07,675 --> 01:04:09,609
So what's wrong?

781
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:12,945
What is it?

782
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:18,278
[Sighs]
Is it bad?

783
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,847
Real bad?

784
01:04:21,922 --> 01:04:23,856

785
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:41,198
Yeah.

786
01:04:50,718 --> 01:04:52,811
What did they do to you?

787
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:57,819
They ignore me.

788
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:01,127
Yeah.

789
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:05,855
Yeah.

790
01:05:08,702 --> 01:05:11,193
What did you wanna be
when you were young?

791
01:05:12,907 --> 01:05:16,035
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be John Lennon.

792
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:19,509
Carl, don't be a goof.

793
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,208
I'm trying to make
a serious point here.

794
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:25,150
Carl, I've been teaching
for 22 years.

795
01:05:26,954 --> 01:05:30,515
And each year, these kids
get more and more arrogant.

796
01:05:30,591 --> 01:05:33,355
Oh, bullshit, man.
Come on, Vern.

797
01:05:33,427 --> 01:05:37,090
- The kids haven't changed,
you have.
- [Sighs]

798
01:05:37,164 --> 01:05:41,362
You took a teaching position
'cause you thought
it'd be fun, right?

799
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:44,598
Thought you could have
summer vacations off.

800
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:48,506
And then you found out
it was actually work.
That really bummed you out.

801
01:05:51,211 --> 01:05:53,236
These kids turned on me.

802
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:59,416
They think
I'm a big fucking joke.
Come on.

803
01:05:59,486 --> 01:06:04,253
Listen, Vern. If you were 16,
what would you think of you?

804
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:09,058
Hey, Carl, you think
I give one rat's ass
what these kids think of me?

805
01:06:09,129 --> 01:06:11,529
Yes, I do.

806
01:06:11,598 --> 01:06:16,001
You think about this.
When you get old, these kids...

807
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:19,062
when I get old... they're gonna be
running the country.

808
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:21,300
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

809
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:24,776
Now this is the thought
that wakes me up
in the middle of the night.

810
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:29,741
When I get older,
these kids are gonna
take care of me.

811
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:33,451
I wouldn't count on it.

812
01:06:36,857 --> 01:06:40,258
What would I do
for a million bucks?

813
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:43,194
I guess I'd do
as little as I had to.

814
01:06:43,263 --> 01:06:45,731
That's boring.
Well, how am I
supposed to answer?

815
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:50,099
The idea is to, like, search your mind
for the absolute limit.

816
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:54,470
Like, um... would you
drive to school naked?

817
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:57,009
[Chuckles]

818
01:06:57,077 --> 01:07:00,604
Um... would I have to
get out of the car?

819
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:04,617
- Of course.
- In the spring or winter?

820
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:06,619
[Claire]
Doesn't matter. Spring.

821
01:07:06,687 --> 01:07:09,178
[Andy]
In front of the school
or in back of the school?

822
01:07:09,256 --> 01:07:12,157
- Either one.
- Yes.

823
01:07:12,226 --> 01:07:14,592
I'd do that.

824
01:07:14,661 --> 01:07:18,028
I'll do anything sexual.
I don't need a million dollars
to do it either.

825
01:07:19,566 --> 01:07:22,501
- You're lying.
- I already have.

826
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:25,970
I've done just about
everything there is, except
a few things that are illegal.

827
01:07:27,374 --> 01:07:31,834
- I'm a nymphomaniac.
- Lie.

828
01:07:31,912 --> 01:07:33,971
Are your parents
aware of this?

829
01:07:34,048 --> 01:07:36,881
The only person I told
was my shrink.

830
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,111
What did he do
when you told him?

831
01:07:39,186 --> 01:07:41,211
He nailed me.

832
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:47,126
Very nice.

833
01:07:47,194 --> 01:07:49,287
I don't think that
from a legal standpoint...

834
01:07:49,363 --> 01:07:52,355
what he did can be construed as rape
since I paid him.

835
01:07:52,433 --> 01:07:56,529
- He's an adult.
- Yeah. He's married too.

836
01:07:56,603 --> 01:08:00,801
Oh! Do you have any idea
how completely gross that is?

837
01:08:00,874 --> 01:08:04,139
Well, the first
few times...
The first few times?

838
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:06,543
You mean, he did it
more than once?
Sure.

839
01:08:06,613 --> 01:08:10,071
Are you crazy?
Obviously she's crazy
if she's screwing her shrink.

840
01:08:12,553 --> 01:08:14,544
Have you ever done it?

841
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:18,850
[Scoffs]
I don't even have a psychiatrist.

842
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:21,326
Have you ever done it
with a normal person?

843
01:08:21,395 --> 01:08:25,525
- Didn't we already cover this?
- You never answered the question.

844
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:29,797
Look. I'm not going to discuss
my private life with total strangers.

845
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,929
It's kind of a
double-edged sword, isn't it?

846
01:08:32,005 --> 01:08:36,339
A what?
If you say you haven't,
you're a prude.

847
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:40,471
If you say you have,
you're a slut. It's a trap.

848
01:08:40,547 --> 01:08:42,481
You want to,
but you can't.

849
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:46,383
And when you do, you wish
you didn't, right?
Wrong.

850
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:48,944
Or are you a tease?

851
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:53,316
She's a tease.
I'm sure.
Why don't you forget it?

852
01:08:53,393 --> 01:08:56,556
You're a tease
and you know it.
All girls are teases.

853
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,622
- She's only a tease if what
she does gets you hot.
- I don't do anything!

854
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,364
- That's why you're a tease.
- Okay, let me ask you
a few questions.

855
01:09:04,438 --> 01:09:06,633
I already
told you everything.
No.

856
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:09,972
Doesn't it bother you to sleep
around without being in love?
Don't you want respect?

857
01:09:10,043 --> 01:09:12,739
I don't screw
to get respect.

858
01:09:12,813 --> 01:09:14,747
That's the difference
between you and me.

859
01:09:14,815 --> 01:09:16,908
[Scoffs]
It's not the only difference
I hope.

860
01:09:16,984 --> 01:09:19,578
[Bender]
Face it, you're a tease.
I'm not a tease.

861
01:09:19,653 --> 01:09:21,848
Sure you are.
Sex is your weapon.

862
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:24,823
You said it yourself.
You use it to get respect.

863
01:09:24,892 --> 01:09:28,658
No, I never said that.
She twisted my words around.

864
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:31,823
- What do you use it for then?
- I don't use it, period!

865
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:35,426
Are you medically frigid
or is it psychological?

866
01:09:35,502 --> 01:09:38,903
I didn't mean it that way.
You guys are putting words
into my mouth.

867
01:09:38,972 --> 01:09:41,770
- Just answer the question.
- [Brian] Why don't you
just answer the question?

868
01:09:41,842 --> 01:09:44,709
Be honest.
No big deal.
Yeah, answer it.

869
01:09:44,778 --> 01:09:47,576
- Just answer the question.
- Talk to us.
- Answer the question.!

870
01:09:47,648 --> 01:09:50,276
Don't be a jerk.!
It's easy.
It's only one question.

871
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,750
No, I never did it!

872
01:09:57,324 --> 01:10:00,623
I never did it either.

873
01:10:02,129 --> 01:10:05,895
I'm not a nymphomaniac.
I'm a compulsive liar.

874
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,525
You are such a bitch!

875
01:10:09,603 --> 01:10:12,868
You did that on purpose
just to fuck me over.!

876
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,569
I would do it though.
If you love someone, it's okay.

877
01:10:18,278 --> 01:10:20,041
[Claire]
I can't believe you.
You're so weird.

878
01:10:20,113 --> 01:10:23,082
You don't say anything all day,
and then when
you open your mouth...

879
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:25,983
you unload all these
tremendous lies all over me.

880
01:10:26,053 --> 01:10:29,580
You're just pissed off because
she got you to admit something
you didn't want to admit to.

881
01:10:29,656 --> 01:10:32,022
Okay, fine.
But that doesn't make it
any less bizarre.

882
01:10:32,092 --> 01:10:36,188
What's bizarre?
I mean, we're all
pretty bizarre.

883
01:10:36,263 --> 01:10:38,561
Some of us are just
better at hiding it, that's all.

884
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:40,657
How are you bizarre?

885
01:10:43,036 --> 01:10:44,970
He can't think for himself.

886
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:49,601
She's right.

887
01:10:49,676 --> 01:10:53,737
Do you guys know what, uh,
what I did to get in here?

888
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:57,514
I taped Larry Lester's
buns together.

889
01:10:57,584 --> 01:10:59,575
- [Laughs]
- That was you?

890
01:10:59,653 --> 01:11:03,612
- Yeah. You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

891
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:06,352
Then you know how hairy
he is, right?

892
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:10,723
When they pulled
the tape off...

893
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:14,289
most of his hair came off
and some skin too.

894
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:16,700
Oh, my God.

895
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:19,534
The bizarre thing is...

896
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:21,699
is that I did it
for my old man.

897
01:11:23,577 --> 01:11:26,273
I tortured this poor kid...

898
01:11:26,346 --> 01:11:29,144
because I wanted him
to think that I was cool.

899
01:11:31,718 --> 01:11:36,178
He's always going off about,
you know, when he was in school.

900
01:11:36,256 --> 01:11:39,714
All the wild things
he used to do.

901
01:11:39,793 --> 01:11:45,629
And I got the feeling that
he was disappointed that I never
cut loose on anyone, right?

902
01:11:48,035 --> 01:11:52,028
So, I'm sittin'
in the locker room...

903
01:11:52,105 --> 01:11:54,596
and I'm taping up my knee.

904
01:11:56,343 --> 01:12:01,144
And Larry's undressing
a couple lockers down from me.

905
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:05,851
And... he's kind of...

906
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:07,853
he's kind of skinny.

907
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:10,583
He's weak.

908
01:12:10,657 --> 01:12:14,525
And I started thinking
about my father...

909
01:12:14,594 --> 01:12:18,963
and his attitude about...
about weakness.

910
01:12:19,032 --> 01:12:22,934
And the next thing I knew...

911
01:12:23,003 --> 01:12:27,201
I jumped on top of him
and started wailing on him.

912
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:32,670
And my friends, they just laughed
and cheered me on.

913
01:12:35,615 --> 01:12:39,210
And afterwards...

914
01:12:39,286 --> 01:12:42,346
when I was sitting
in Vernon's office...

915
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:48,121
all I could think about...

916
01:12:48,195 --> 01:12:51,722
was Larry's father...

917
01:12:51,798 --> 01:12:55,791
and Larry
having to go home...

918
01:12:55,869 --> 01:13:00,272
and... and explain
what happened to him.

919
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:07,937
And... the humiliation...

920
01:13:08,014 --> 01:13:11,142
fucking humiliation
he must have felt.

921
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:16,581
It must have been unreal.

922
01:13:19,192 --> 01:13:23,094
I mean, how do you apologize
for something like that?

923
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,834
There's no way.

924
01:13:33,006 --> 01:13:35,668
It's all because of me
and my old man.

925
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,814
God, I fucking hate him.

926
01:13:44,418 --> 01:13:49,412
He's like this...
He's like this mindless machine
that I can't relate to anymore.

927
01:13:50,924 --> 01:13:56,157
Andrew.!
You've got to be number one.!

928
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:58,754
I won't tolerate any losers
in this family.

929
01:13:58,832 --> 01:14:03,633
Your intensity is for shit!
Win! Win! Win!

930
01:14:05,038 --> 01:14:07,836
You son of a bitch.

931
01:14:10,744 --> 01:14:15,204
You know sometimes
I wish my knee would give...

932
01:14:15,282 --> 01:14:18,308
then I wouldn't be able
to wrestle anymore.

933
01:14:18,385 --> 01:14:22,515
Then he could forget
all about me.

934
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:25,820
I think your old man
and my old man should get
together and go bowling.

935
01:14:25,892 --> 01:14:27,860
[Chuckles]

936
01:14:32,098 --> 01:14:34,032
It's like me, you know,
with my grades.

937
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,503
Like when l... when l...
when I step outside myself...

938
01:14:38,572 --> 01:14:41,837
and like when I look in
at myself, you know.

939
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:46,739
And l... And I see me.

940
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,984
I don't like what I see.

941
01:14:53,286 --> 01:14:55,550
I really don't.

942
01:14:55,622 --> 01:15:00,685
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you like yourself?

943
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,751
Sounds stupid, but...

944
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:08,567
because I'm failing shop.

945
01:15:10,403 --> 01:15:15,067
We had this assignment,
you know, to make this,
like, ceramic elephant...

946
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:17,439
and we had eight weeks
to do it.

947
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:21,072
And then, you know,
we're supposed to... It was like a lamp.

948
01:15:21,147 --> 01:15:25,083
And when, you know,
when you pull it, the trunk,
the light was supposed to go on.

949
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:30,183
But my light didn't go on.

950
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:32,384
I got an "F" on it.

951
01:15:33,627 --> 01:15:35,561
I've never got an "F" in my life.

952
01:15:36,963 --> 01:15:39,557
When I signed up, you know,
for the course, I mean...

953
01:15:39,633 --> 01:15:41,658
I thought I was playing it
real smart, you know...

954
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:43,760
'cause I thought, you know,
I'll take shop.

955
01:15:43,837 --> 01:15:46,271
It'll be such
an easy way to maintain
my grade point average.

956
01:15:46,339 --> 01:15:48,273
Why'd you think
it'd be easy?

957
01:15:50,744 --> 01:15:52,871
Have you seen some of the dopes
that take shop?

958
01:15:52,946 --> 01:15:56,882
I take shop.
You must be a fuckin'idiot.

959
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:58,747
I'm a fuckin' idiot
'cause I can't make a lamp?

960
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:01,378
No, you're a genius 'cause
you can't make a lamp.

961
01:16:01,454 --> 01:16:04,150
What do you know
about trigonometry?

962
01:16:04,224 --> 01:16:05,987
I could care less
about trigonometry.

963
01:16:06,059 --> 01:16:08,960
Bender, did you know
without trigonometry,
there'd be no engineering?

964
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:10,894
Without lamps,
there'd be no light.

965
01:16:10,964 --> 01:16:14,730
Okay, so neither one of you
is any better than the other one.

966
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:17,133
I can write with my toes.

967
01:16:17,203 --> 01:16:20,604
I can also eat,
brush my teeth...

968
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:22,835
With your feet?

969
01:16:22,909 --> 01:16:26,003
- Play "Heart And Soul" on the piano.
- I can make spaghetti.

970
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:29,980
What can you do?

971
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:33,315
I can, uh, tape
all of your buns together.

972
01:16:33,386 --> 01:16:36,287
I wanna see
what Claire can do.

973
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:39,086
- I can't do anything.
- Everybody can do something.

974
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:43,825
There's one thing I can do.

975
01:16:43,897 --> 01:16:47,196
- No, forget it.
It's way too embarrassing.
- You ever seen Wild Kingdom?

976
01:16:47,267 --> 01:16:49,201
That guy's been doing
that show for 30 years.

977
01:16:50,503 --> 01:16:55,202

down the hall together?

They'd laugh their asses off,

you were doing it with me...

for being seen with me.

01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,014
Well, that's what Vernon
wants us to do.

1138
01:28:10,082 --> 01:28:14,348
[Claire] True.
But I think we'd all
kind of say the same thing.

1139
01:28:15,755 --> 01:28:18,849
You just don't wanna
write your paper, right?

1140
01:28:18,924 --> 01:28:22,883
True, but you're
the smartest, right?

1141
01:28:22,962 --> 01:28:26,921
Well. Um...
We trust you.

1142
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:32,161
Yeah.

1143
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:38,176
All right.
I'll do it.

1144
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:41,212
Great.

1145
01:28:53,526 --> 01:28:55,551
Come on.

1146
01:28:55,628 --> 01:28:58,597
Where we going?
Come on.

1147
01:29:00,599 --> 01:29:04,433
[Claire]
Don't be afraid.

1148
01:29:04,503 --> 01:29:06,596
Don't stick that
in my eye.
I'm not sticking...

1149
01:29:06,672 --> 01:29:09,402
Just close it. Wait a minute.
Just go like... go like that.

1150
01:29:11,444 --> 01:29:16,006
Good.
[Whimpers]

1151
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:19,108
You know, you really do
look better without all
that black shit on your eyes.

1152
01:29:19,185 --> 01:29:21,881
Hey, I like
that black shit.

1153
01:29:23,222 --> 01:29:25,417
[Claire]
This looks a lot better.

1154
01:29:25,491 --> 01:29:27,425
Look up.

01:29:33,032 --> 01:29:35,762
[Sighs]

1156
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:39,703
Please. Why are you
being so nice to me?

1157
01:29:39,772 --> 01:29:41,706
'Cause you're letting me.

[Door Opens]

You lost?

1160
01:30:52,545 --> 01:30:55,207
Thank you.

1161
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:05,155
Why'd you do that?

1162
01:31:05,224 --> 01:31:08,387
'Cause I knew
you wouldn't.

1163
01:31:08,461 --> 01:31:12,727
You know how you said before
how your parents use you
to get back at each other?

1164
01:31:12,798 --> 01:31:15,323
Wouldn't I be outstanding
in that capacity?

1165
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:20,900
Were you really disgusted
about what I did
with my lipstick?

1166
01:31:22,007 --> 01:31:25,670
Truth?
Truth.

1167
01:31:25,744 --> 01:31:27,678
No.

1168
01:31:37,723 --> 01:31:40,556
What happened to you?

1169
01:31:40,626 --> 01:31:44,392
Why?
Claire did it.

1170
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:50,558
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

1171
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:56,199
It's just... you're just
so different, you know.

1172
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:59,369
I can see your face.

1173
01:31:59,445 --> 01:32:01,379
Is that good or bad?

1174
01:32:02,815 --> 01:32:05,010
That's good.

1175
01:32:19,832 --> 01:32:21,959
See ya, Brian.
Hey, Carl.

1176
01:32:23,269 --> 01:32:25,829
See ya next Saturday.
You bet.
