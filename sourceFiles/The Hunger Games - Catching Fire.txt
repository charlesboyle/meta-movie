moment you revealed

79
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:11,636
those poison berries
in the arena.

80
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:14,097

Seneca Crane,

81

82
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:18,768
he would have blown you

00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:20,228
But here you are.

84
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:22,480
I expect you can
guess where he is.

Yes, I think so.

86

After that fiasco, there
was nothing left to do

87
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,071
but to let you play out
your little scenario.

88
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:32,532
And you were very good.

89
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:36,161
That whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.

90
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,163
Impressive. Truly.

91
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,457
You convinced the
people in The Capitol.

92
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,919
Unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.

93
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:48,423
I mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,

94
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:51,009
people viewed your little
trick with the berries

95
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,886
as an act of defiance.

96
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:55,013
Not as an act of love.

97
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:57,724
And if a girl from
District 12 of all places

98
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:01,102
can defy The Capitol and
walk away unharmed,

99
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:03,480
what is to prevent them
from doing the same?

100
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,565
What is to prevent, say,

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,567
an uprising?

102
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,695
That can lead to revolution.

103
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:12,697
And then, in a fraction of time,

104
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:13,990
the whole system collapses.

105
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,784
It must be a fragile system,

106
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,036
if it can be brought down
by just a few berries.

107
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:19,871
Yes, it is, indeed.

108
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,499
But not in the way
you imagine it.

109
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,042
How should I imagine?

110
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,295
You should imagine thousands upon
thousands of your people dead.

111
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:31,508
This town of yours reduced
to ashes. Imagine it gone.

112

113

existed, like District 13.

Tell me.

123
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,502
At what point did he
realize the depth of your

124
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:09,504
indifference towards him?

125
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,673
- I'm not indifferent.
- Don't lie!

126
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,758
You promised.

127
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,438

need to be grateful.

Fun is my job.

00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:02,330
Thought that was what happened
to Seneca Crane. Too much fun.

533
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,461
Seneca decided to
quit breathing.

534

She just wants to save her own

There's no winners.

851
00:48:10,825 --> 00:48:12,659

852

it takes to save him.

00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,234
If they call his name, I'll
volunteer in his place.

gonna be different.

facing other Victors.

917

know about The Games.

924

with all experienced killers.

925
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:39,782
All right. What does
that mean for us?

926
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:42,534
That means you're gonna
have to have some allies.

927
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,954
Okay. I think that if...

928
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,789
Whoop. You're not the problem.

929
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
No.

930
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,377
Look, you're starting
at a disadvantage.

931
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,796
Most of these people have
been friends for years.

932
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,756
That just puts us higher
on their kill list.

933
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,884
Do it your own way, but
I know these people.

934
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:00,219
You go it alone,

935
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,263
their first move is gonna
be to hunt you down.

936
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:04,974
Both of you.

937
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:07,142
Katniss, come on.

938
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,316
How could any of us
even trust each other?

939
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:18,237
It's not about trust.
It's about staying alive.

940
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:20,823
Cashmere and Gloss.

941
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:22,574
Brother and sister.
District 1.

942
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:25,411
They won back-to-back Games.
Capitol favorites.

943
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,414
Lots of sponsors.
They will be lethal.

944
00:54:29,457 --> 00:54:31,333
And the other half
of the Career Pack,

945
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:32,626
Brutus and Enobaria.

946
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:33,752
What's with her teeth?

947
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:37,089
She had them filed into fangs so she
could rip people's throats out.

948
00:54:37,298 --> 00:54:38,507
She's committed.
I'll give her that.

949
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,011
Wiress and Beetee. Not
fighters, but brilliant.

950
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:44,638
And weird. Real tech-savvy.

951
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,598
He won his Games
by electrocuting

952
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:47,975
six Tributes at once.

953
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,519
The Morphlings. Masters
of camouflage.

954
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,939
Basically, won their Games by hiding
until everyone else was dead.

955
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:56,608
Self-medicating ever since.
Which I applaud.

956
00:54:56,818 --> 00:54:57,860
Not a threat.

957
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:00,487
Finnick Odair, right?

958
00:55:00,655 --> 00:55:03,449
Yes. He won his Games at 14.
Youngest ever.

959
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:05,617
- Extremely humble.
- You're kidding.

960
00:55:05,827 --> 00:55:08,287
Yes, I'm kidding.
He's a peacock.

961
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,455
A total preener.

962
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,458
But he's The Capitol darling.
They love him here.

963
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,876
Charming, smart,

964
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,379
and very skilled at combat.
Especially in water.

965
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:18,756
What about weaknesses?

966
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:20,049
One. Mags.

967
00:55:20,258 --> 00:55:22,009
She volunteered for Annie.

968
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:25,054
Mags was his mentor and
basically raised him.

969
00:55:25,263 --> 00:55:28,682
If he's trying to protect her
in any way, it exposes him.

970
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,642
A guy like that has to know
she's not gonna make it.

971
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:33,121
I bet when it really comes down
to it, he won't protect her.

972
00:55:33,146 --> 00:55:35,939
Well, Katniss, I just hope when
she goes, she goes quickly.

973

have more money than I need, so...

What did you do with all
your wealth, anyway?

I think so, too.

1833
01:59:41,490 --> 01:59:45,201
And once the Careers are dead,
we both know what happens next.

1834
01:59:45,453 --> 01:59:47,287
I don't want to be the
one that shoots first.

1835
01:59:47,747 --> 01:59:49,664
What if they don't either?

1836
01:59:50,124 --> 01:59:52,000
What if all of us
refuse to shoot first?

1837
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:54,544
We might still end up dead.

1838
01:59:55,588 --> 01:59:58,423
Maybe not. I mean, it
worked for us last time.

1839
01:59:58,758 --> 02:00:00,884
They're not gonna make
that same mistake again.

1840
